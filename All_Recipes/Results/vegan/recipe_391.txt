Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  Lightly spray a cookie sheet with vegetable cooking spray.
Place the asparagus and mushrooms in a bowl.  Drizzle with the olive oil, then season with rosemary, salt, and pepper; toss well.  Lay the asparagus and mushrooms out on the prepared pan in an even layer.  Roast in the preheated oven until the asparagus is tender, about 15 minutes.
