Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and place in a 9 x 13 inch baking dish.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over high heat, boil 2 tablespoons of broth.  Reduce heat to low.  Stir in flour, seasoning salt, pepper, mustard and nutmeg.  Gradually add soy milk, stirring constantly until thickened.  Stir in half of the soy cheese.  Stir constantly until cheese is melted.  Pour over potatoes.
In a small bowl combine the remaining broth and the bread crumbs.  Spoon evenly over potatoes.  Top with remaining soy cheese.  Sprinkle with paprika.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes.
