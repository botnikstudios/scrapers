Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7x11 1/2-inch pan.
Mix oats, chocolate chips, flour, agave nectar, cherries, applesauce, almonds, coconut, sunflower seeds, brown sugar, baking soda, and vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl. Lightly press mixture into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before cutting into bars. Let bars cool completely before removing from pan.
