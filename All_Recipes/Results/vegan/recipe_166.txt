Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave until melted, about 1 minute. Stir in milk blend and vanilla extract until thoroughly mixed.
Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and sea salt together in a large bowl. Pour in coconut oil mixture; mix until batter is thick and blended. Fold in shredded coconut.
Spread batter evenly into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before cutting into squares.
