Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cumin, garlic, oregano and Sazon to pot. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add wine; bring to a boil. Add 1 cup water, beans, bay leaves, brown sugar and vinegar; bring bean mixture to a boil. Reduce to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens and ingredients come together, about 15 minutes. Season soup with Adobo; discard bay leaf.
Divide soup evenly among serving bowls. Garnish with onions and cilantro, if desired.
