Whisk coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, sriracha sauce, and ground chile powder in a bowl until a smooth sauce forms.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots and red bell pepper; saute until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tofu; saute until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Pour sauce into the skillet; stir to coat tofu, carrots, and bell pepper. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low; stir in spinach 1 cup at a time until wilted. Serve over brown rice.
