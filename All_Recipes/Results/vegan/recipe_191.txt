Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch square baking pan.
Sift flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl. Stir pumpkin, canola oil, and vanilla extract into flour mixture until a thick batter forms. Pour batter into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 minutes.
