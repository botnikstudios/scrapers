Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine squash and 1 tablespoon oil on a baking sheet; toss until coated.
Roast in the preheated oven until tender and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add cashews; simmer until softened, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Combine cashews and 1 1/2 cup broth in a blender; blend until very smooth. Add roasted squash, remaining 1/2 cup broth, miso, nutritional yeast, and lemon juice; blend until sauce is combined.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta water. Transfer pasta to a serving bowl.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and salt; cook and stir until golden brown, about 9 minutes. Add sage and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in cider; cook, stirring up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir half of the cashew sauce into the pasta. Add onion mixture. Stir in enough reserved pasta water to thin and warm sauce. Season with pepper. Garnish with parsley.
