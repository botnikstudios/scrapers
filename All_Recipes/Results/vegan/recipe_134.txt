Spray the inside of a stockpot with cooking spray; place over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in the stockpot until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion and about 2 tablespoons vegetable broth to garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir kale into onion mixture; cook until slightly wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Add chickpeas, remaining vegetable broth, vegetable bouillon, and curry powder; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until heated through, about 15 minutes. Add almond milk and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
