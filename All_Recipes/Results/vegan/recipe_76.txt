Whisk spelt flour, oat flour, baking powder, flaxseed meal, and salt together in a large mixing bowl.
Stir soy milk, applesauce, agave nectar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl.
Form a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour soy milk mixture into the well. Stir until the ingredients are just moistened; set aside for 15 minutes.
Lightly oil and heat a griddle to medium heat.
Spoon batter onto hot griddle, sprinkle blueberries onto wet batter, and cook until bubbles form, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes more.
