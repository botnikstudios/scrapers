Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Wash and halve tomatoes. Gently squeeze out the seeds. Place the tomatoes on a non-stick cookie sheet, and sprinkle with salt to taste.
Bake until tomatoes take on a leathery texture. This could literally take all day; smaller pieces will require less oven time.
