Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a baking sheet.
Bring water to a boil and stir in oatmeal.  Cover and reduce heat to low.  Cook 5 to 10 minutes, or until the oats are cooked and all the water has been absorbed.  Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes.
To the oatmeal add onion, oil, spaghetti sauce, pecans, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, basil, onion powder, coriander, sage and active yeast.  Mix well and form into patties.  Place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes.  Turn patties over and bake another 15 minutes.
