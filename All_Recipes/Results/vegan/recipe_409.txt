Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and celery in hot oil until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir garlic into the onion mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Pour vegetable broth and tomato sauce into pot. Simmer for about 10 minutes.
Stir carrots and potatoes through the broth. Simmer until carrots are tender, 10 to 15 minutes more.
Drop corn, edamame, okra, and kale into the soup. Continue to simmer until okra is tender, 5 to 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
