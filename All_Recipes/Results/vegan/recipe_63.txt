Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine whole wheat flour, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, chia seeds, and white sugar in a bowl. Mix in coconut oil in until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in soy milk, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons lemon zest until a dough forms.
Transfer dough to a bowl and knead in bowl until workable, about 8 times. Gently roll into a ball and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Press into a circle about 1 inch thick; cut into 10 wedges. Place scones onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are lightly golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
Mix confectioners' sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon lemon zest in a small bowl. Drizzle or spread frosting on top of scones while still warm.
