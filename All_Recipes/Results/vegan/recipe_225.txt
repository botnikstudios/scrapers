Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat; saute onion, green bell pepper, celery, carrot, and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add black beans, diced tomatoes, water, and cumin to onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have combined, at least 20 minutes.
