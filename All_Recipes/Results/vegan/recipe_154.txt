Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until soft, about 3 minutes. Pour in vegetable broth. Increase heat to high and bring broth to a boil. Add lentils. Reduce heat to medium and cook until soft, about 45 minutes.
Stir kale, Swiss chard, and mustard greens into the broth; simmer until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in nutritional yeast, garlic powder, thyme, pepper, and salt. Let soup cool, about 10 minutes.
Transfer soup to a blender; puree until smooth. Pour back into the pot and reheat, about 5 minutes.
