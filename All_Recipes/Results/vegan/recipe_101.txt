Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir yams, onions, cabbage, tomatoes, coconut, and garlic in the hot oil until the vegetables are slightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour tomato juice and apple juice into the Dutch oven; season with ginger, cayenne pepper, and salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer for 1 hour.
Stir bell pepper and peanut butter into the mixture. Cook, stirring regularly, until the peanut butter is melted completely into the soup, about 30 minutes more.
