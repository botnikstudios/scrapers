Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 8x4-inch loaf pans.
Sift the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
Beat the bananas, applesauce, vegetable oil, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon juice together in a separate large bowl. Beat the flour mixture into the banana mixture; add the zucchini and mix until combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 90 minutes. Cool in the pans for 20 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
