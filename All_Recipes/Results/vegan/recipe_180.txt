Whisk soy milk, flour, nutritional yeast, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl; transfer to a rimmed plate or shallow dish. Dip both sides of each bread slice in soy milk mixture.
Heat a lightly oiled skillet over medium-low heat. Cook each slice of bread until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
