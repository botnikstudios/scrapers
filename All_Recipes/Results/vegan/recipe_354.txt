In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil.  Bring to a boil and remove from heat.  Stir in flour until mixture forms a ball.
Heat oil for frying in deep-fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Pipe strips of dough into hot oil using a pastry bag.  Fry until golden; drain on paper towels.
