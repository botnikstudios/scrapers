Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Stir in brown sugar, oats, and chocolate chips. In a separate bowl, combine oil and vanilla extract; stir into flour mixture. Press dough into a 15x10 inch jelly roll pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly brown, about 15 minutes. Cool before cutting into bars.
