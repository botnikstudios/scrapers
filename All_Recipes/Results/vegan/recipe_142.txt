Put millet in a bowl and pour enough water over millet to cover by at least 2 inches. Soak millet 8 hours to overnight; drain.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix millet, 2 1/2 cups water, salt, and cumin into onion mixture. Cover and simmer until millet is tender and water is absorbed, 20 minutes. Stir curry powder into millet mixture until fully incorporated.
