Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Mix amaranth flour, buckwheat flour, coconut flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ground ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.
Stir flax meal and 6 tablespoons water together in a separate bowl. Add agave nectar, canola oil, molasses, grated fresh ginger, and lemon zest; stir to combine. Pour wet ingredients into the well in the flour mixture; mix well. Gradually stir boiling water into the batter until fully incorporated. Pour batter into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
