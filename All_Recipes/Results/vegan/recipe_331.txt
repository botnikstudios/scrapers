Heat sesame oil in a large skillet or wok until sizzling; add collard greens, gomasio, and mirin. Cook until collard greens are tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir garlic into collard green mixture and cook just until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds; remove from heat. Season with additional sea salt if desired.
