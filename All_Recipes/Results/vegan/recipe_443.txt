Place onion, bell pepper, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers into a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Add tomatoes, and pulse just a few times until the tomatoes are coarsely chopped. Transfer to a bowl with a tight-fitting lid.
In a separate bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, lime juice, and salt.
Pour dressing over tomatoes, and stir well. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
