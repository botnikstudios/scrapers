Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Cook, covered, until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.
Transfer boiled potatoes to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Mash with a potato masher, adding reserved cooking water to reach desired consistency.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet. Cook soy chorizo for 5 minutes. Add mashed potatoes and mix well.
Heat tortillas on a hot griddle over medium heat to soften them. Fill them with equal amounts of potato-chorizo mixture. Fold them in half and brush the outside of the tortillas with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Place tacos on the hot griddle and cook, turning once, until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
