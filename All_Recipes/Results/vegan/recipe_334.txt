Place cashews in a large bowl. Pour enough water over cashews to cover.
Cover the bowl and soak cashews overnight, at least 12 hours.
Drain the water from cashews; place cashews in a blender. For a tangier cheddar flavor add 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice to cashews.  Pour enough water to come to 1/4-inch below of the top of the cashews. Blend until partially smooth.
Place nutritional yeast, onion, sunflower seed oil, salt, garlic powder, tamari sauce, turmeric, and cayenne pepper in blender. Blend until smooth.
