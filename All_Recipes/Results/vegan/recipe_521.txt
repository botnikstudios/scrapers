Bring the blueberries, orange juice, and lemon juice to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the lemon zest and cinnamon; adjust heat to low setting.
Whisk together the water and cornstarch until there are no lumps. Stir the cornstarch mixture and brown sugar into the blueberry mixture until thickened. Remove from heat and allow to rest for 10 minutes before using.
