Stir the margarine and brown sugar together in a pan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, and cook for 1 minute until dark brown. Remove from heat, and whisk in the soy milk and vanilla extract until smooth.
Beat the shortening together with 2 cups confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl until well blended. Continue beating, and gradually add the brown sugar mixture, alternating with the remaining confectioners' sugar.
