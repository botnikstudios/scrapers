Dissolve the cornstarch in the water in a small cup or bowl and set aside. In a saucepan, combine 1 1/2  cups of cherry juice and agar-agar powder. Let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Set heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 1 minute.
Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining juice along with the cornstarch mixture until no longer cloudy. Pour into small serving cups and refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.
