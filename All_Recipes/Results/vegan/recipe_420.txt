Mix 2 cups flour and salt with vegetable shortening using pastry blender. Mix in 6 to 8 tablespoons ice water and stir until mixture forms a ball.  Divide ball in half.
Using a rolling pin, roll one of balls to fit the bottom and sides of an 11x7 inch baking dish. Roll out the other half of dough to form top crust.
