Heat 1 teaspoon canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in red chiles and green chiles, 1/2-inch cinnamon stick, pearl onions, coconut, coriander, cashews, cardamom pods, cloves, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, and cumin seeds. Cook, stirring constantly, until spices are fragrant and coconut starts toasting, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer to a spice grinder. Add cilantro, mint, and 1 teaspoon water; grind until a smooth paste forms, adding more water as needed.
Heat 1 teaspoon canola oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds and 1-inch cinnamon stick; cook for 30 seconds. Add minced garlic, ginger, and curry leaves; cook and stir until garlic and ginger are fragrant, about 2 minutes more.
Pour cooked vegetables and spice paste into garlic-ginger mixture and bring to a boil. Add more water if curry is too thick. Mix in green peas and salt, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes more.
