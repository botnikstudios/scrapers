Place the beets into a medium bowl and set aside.
In a medium saucepan, combine vinegar and 1/2 cup beet juice and bring to a boil.  Add sugar, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaf, salt and onion, and return to a boil.  Remove from heat, and pour mixture over the beets. Toss until coated, cover and chill.  Serve the beets very cold.
