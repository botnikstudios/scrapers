Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toast pitas 5 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until crisp. Remove from heat, and break into bite size pieces.
In a large bowl, toss together toasted pita pieces, romaine lettuce, green onions, cucumber, and tomatoes.
In a small bowl, mix the parsley, garlic, sumac powder, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and mint. Pour over the pita mixture, and toss just before serving.
