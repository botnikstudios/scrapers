Heat margarine in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir basil and chives until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Heat vegetable stock in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat; keep warm.
Cook and stir onion, tomato, potatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper into chive mixture until onion is tender, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and chickpeas; cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir rice into chickpea mixture; cook and stir until rice is coated and lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir warm vegetable stock, 1 cup at a time, into rice mixture, waiting until the broth is absorbed before adding next cup. Continue stirring rice and adding vegetable stock until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes.
