Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon teriyaki sauce in a large skillet over medium heat. Add carrot, bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in bok choy, zucchini, and garlic powder. Drizzle on remaining teriyaki sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until zucchini is tender, about 7 minutes.
