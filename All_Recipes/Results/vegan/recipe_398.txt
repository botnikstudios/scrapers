Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment pepper.
Cut eggplants in quarters lengthwise. Slice very thinly, about 1/8 inch thick.
Whisk tamari, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, black pepper, liquid smoke, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper together in a large mixing bowl. Slowly drizzle in olive oil while whisking continuously.
Dip eggplant slices in brine solution and manually wipe off some of the excess. Place slices on prepared baking sheets. Reserve extra brine.
Bake in preheated oven about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and brush lightly with reserved brine. Bake another 15 minutes and turn slices over. Continue to bake until slices are browned and crisp, 15 to 20 more minutes. Thinner slices will be done before thicker ones, so check them occasionally and remove slices that crisp up first.
