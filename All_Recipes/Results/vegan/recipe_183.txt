Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or spray with cooking spray.
Mix oat flour, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, salt, and cloves together in a bowl. Stir hot water and flax seed meal together in a small bowl; add to flour mixture. Stir soy milk, raisins, agave nectar, and olive oil into flour mixture until batter is just mixed. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin cups using an ice cream scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
