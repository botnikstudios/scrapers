Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, water, quinoa, and taco seasoning; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover saucepan, and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Add black beans and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more. Serve quinoa-black bean filling in tortillas.
