Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, chili powder, oregano, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir carrots, tomatoes, celery, and garlic into flour mixture.
Whisk tomato soup and olive oil together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle each muffin with black pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
