Grate peel of orange; reserve.  Peel oranges and discard white membranes.  Separate oranges into sections and place half in a food processor or blender.  To the food processor add half of the cranberries, apples and celery.  Process until coarsely chopped.  Transfer to a bowl; repeat with remaining oranges, cranberries, apples and celery.  Stir in sugar and reserved orange peel.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.
