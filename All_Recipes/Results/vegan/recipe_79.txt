Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x8-inch baking dish.
Stir soy milk and vinegar together in a large glass measuring cup.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Briskly mix canola oil, water, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and almond extract into soy milk mixture using a fork. Stir soy milk mixture into flour mixture until batter is lump-free. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
