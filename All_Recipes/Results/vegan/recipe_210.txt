Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Combine white sugar, cocoa powder, brown sugar, mashed banana, and coconut together in a saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until blended and smooth, about 5 minutes. Add flour mixture; stir until smooth dough forms. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 8 minutes.
