Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Beat sugar, peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Mix flour and cocoa powder into peanut butter mixture; add canola oil and soy milk and stir until batter is moist, crumbly, and stiff. Spread batter into the prepared baking dish using your hands or a spoon.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 25 minutes.
