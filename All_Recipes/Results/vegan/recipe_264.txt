Heat oil in a pot over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add pumpkin, red bell pepper, and ginger; cook until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in curry paste and cook for 1 more minute. Pour in vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until pumpkin and bell pepper are soft, about 25 minutes.
Cut corn kernels off the cob; add to the pot with coconut milk. Cook an additional 5 minutes; season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle with Thai basil before serving.
