Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Combine zucchini, bananas, applesauce, brown sugar, oil, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Whisk flour, baking soda, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, salt, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to zucchini mixture while continuously stirring until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups about 3/4-full.
Mix white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
