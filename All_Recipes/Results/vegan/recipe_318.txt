Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place sweet potato pieces in a bowl. Add olive oil, 1 tablespoon dill, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Spread coated sweet potato in 1 layer on a baking sheet, making sure there is space between each.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Flip fries and bake until just starting to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix vegan mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon dill, and soy sauce together in a bowl; serve alongside fries.
