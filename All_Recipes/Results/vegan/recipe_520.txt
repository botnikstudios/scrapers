Heat oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat.  Saute onion, celery, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper until tender, about 5 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes, with the juice, broth, sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans and garlic.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
