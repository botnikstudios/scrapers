Preheat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat.
In a medium bowl, mix rolled oats, pastry flour, baking powder, baking soda, sea salt, flax seeds, and chocolate chips. Gradually blend in soy milk.
Pour batter about 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared griddle. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, until bubbly. Flip, and continue cooking until lightly browned.
