Heat the oil in a large saucepan and mix in the onions, carrot, parsnip, celery, potato, and leek.  Stir over a medium heat.
Place lentils, tomatoes, stock, bay leaves, a splash of the soy and  Worcestershire sauces and wine in the saucepan. Stir and bring the mixture to a boil.  Cover and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked.
Remove the bay leaves from the soup. Stir in the cilantro and serve.
