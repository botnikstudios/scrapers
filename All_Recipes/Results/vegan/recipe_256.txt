Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onions until they start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and thyme; stir until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in broth, bay leaves, and soy sauce. Bring soup to a boil.
Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; pour into soup and stir well to incorporate. Reduce heat and simmer soup until it starts to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add coconut milk, salt, and black pepper. Simmer just until coconut milk is heated through (do not allow to boil), about 5 minutes.
