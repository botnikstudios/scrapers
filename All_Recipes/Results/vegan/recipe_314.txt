Bring water to boil in a small saucepan.  Pour in quinoa, raisins, and a pinch of salt.  Cover, and let simmer for 12 to 15 minutes, then remove from heat, and allow to cool to room temperature.
Toss together the tomatoes, onion, radish, cucumber, and almonds in a large bowl. Stir in the cooled quinoa, then season with mint, parsley, cumin, lime juice, sesame oil, and salt.  Chill 1 to 2 hours before serving.
