Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking powder, stevia powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in coconut oil with a pastry cutter or knife until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in almond milk until dough is just moistened.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead gently 8 to 10 times. Pat or roll the dough out into a 3/4 inch thick round. Cut circles with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter and arrange biscuits on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
