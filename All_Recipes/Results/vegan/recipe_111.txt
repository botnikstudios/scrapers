Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, water, and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are very tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove pot from the heat and puree soup with an immersion blender. Stir in almond milk.
Return soup to the heat and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with remaining 2 teaspoons salt and pepper.
