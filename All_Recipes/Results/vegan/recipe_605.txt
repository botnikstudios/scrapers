Rinse and strain soaked beans. Place in a large saucepan, and cover with water.  Boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain, discarding the water.
Cover the beans with 3 cups water, and bring to a boil.   Add onions, carrots, celery, tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, thyme, olive oil, and salt and pepper.  Cover.  Cook for about 50 to 60 minutes, until the beans are soft.  Mix the parsley.
If using a pressure cooker, cook all ingredients except parsley for 3 to 4 minutes under 15 pounds pressure.  Stir in parsley.
