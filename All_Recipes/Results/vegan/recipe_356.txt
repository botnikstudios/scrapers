Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine dates and peanut butter in a food processor; process on high in 15-second intervals, gradually adding almond milk while processing, until mixture is smooth. Add vanilla extract and mix well.
Mix oat flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Mix date mixture into flour mixture, adding more oat flour if needed, until dough holds together. Form dough into balls, 1 to 2 tablespoons each, and arrange on the prepared baking sheets. Press a fork into each dough ball, dipping fork in water after each press. Gently press a few raisins into each one.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are just beginning to turn golden, 8 to 12 minutes. Cool completely before eating.
