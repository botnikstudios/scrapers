Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut vegan butter and coconut oil into flour mixture using a fork until crumbly; stir in almond milk until just combined. Drop batter onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are soft and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
