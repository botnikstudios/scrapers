Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Drizzle olive oil over the kale in a large bowl and sprinkle with the nutritional yeast and salt. Stir with your hands to coat kale.
Spread kale onto baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until kale begins to get slightly crisp; rotate racks and flip the chips, and continue baking until completely crisp, 45 to 60 minutes total. Make sure to keep an eye on them to make sure they don't burn; if you notice certain chips ready much sooner than others, take them out.
