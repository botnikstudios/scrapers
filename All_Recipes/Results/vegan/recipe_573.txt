Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Toss the rolled oats, spelt flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, canola oil, applesauce, maple syrup, dried apricots, pecans and ground flax seed together in a bowl, and mix well. Spread the granola mixture on the lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes, stir the granola, then bake for another 15 minutes until dry. Cool completely before serving.
