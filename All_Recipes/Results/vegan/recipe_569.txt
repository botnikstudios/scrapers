Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots and garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes to release the flavors. Season with maple syrup, cumin, chili powder, and black pepper. Pour in the vegetable broth, black beans, 1 can of red beans, and corn. Bring to a boil.
Meanwhile, combine the remaining can of red beans and crushed tomatoes in the container of a large food processor or blender. Process until smooth. Pour into the soup pot, and stir to blend. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes.
