Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat vegetable oil, applesauce, almond milk, and vanilla extract together in a separate large bowl; add flour mixture and stir until combined.
Divide dough into 14 portions and roll into balls. Spread cinnamon-sugar into a wide, shallow bowl. Roll dough balls in the cinnamon-sugar and arrange onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
