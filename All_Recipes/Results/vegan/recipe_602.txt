Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a large, shallow baking dish.
Combine vegetables in prepared baking dish, and lightly salt. Brush with olive oil, and sprinkle with dry soup mix.
Bake for 30 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until vegetables are tender. You can feel with a fork when they are ready.
