Mix beans with onion and bell peppers in a large bowl.
In a small saucepan, combine vinegar, oil, sugar, and herbs.  Season to taste with salt.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves; do not boil.
Pour warm dressing over bean mixture, and marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator before serving.
