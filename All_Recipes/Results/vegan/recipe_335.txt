In a large bowl, combine beans, artichoke hearts, bell peppers, olives, onion, parsley, mint, and basil.
In a jar or small bowl, combine oil and vinegar; shake together or mix well. Pour oil and vinegar over the salad, and toss to coat.
Cover and chill in refrigerator for several hours or overnight, stirring occasionally, to let flavors blend.
