Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together graham cracker crumbs and 1/4 cup maple syrup. Press into a 9 inch pie tin.  Bake for 5 minutes.
In a blender, combine tofu, vegan cream cheese, lemon zest and juice, and confectioners' sugar. Dissolve cornstarch in soy milk, and add to the blender.  Blend until smooth.  Pour filling into crust.
Bake for 25 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue baking for 15 minutes, or until set.   Cool on a wire rack, and then chill for several hours.
Invert onto a plate, and then invert again onto a serving platter.  Pour cherry pie filling over the top, and serve.
