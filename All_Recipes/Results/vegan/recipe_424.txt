Cut cucumbers in half lengthwise and scoop out any large seeds. Slice crosswise into very thin slices.
In a small bowl combine vinegar, sugar, salt and ginger. Mix well. Place cucumbers inside of the bowl, stir so that cucumbers are coated with the mixture. Refrigerate the bowl of cucumbers for at least 1 hour before serving.
