Place fresh cranberries and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Wrap cloves, allspice berries and cinnamon sticks in a spice bag. Place in the water with cranberries.
Cook until cranberries begin to burst, about 10 minutes.
Stir in sugar and reduce heat to low. Continue cooking 5 minutes, or until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Discard spice bag. Chill in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight, before serving.
