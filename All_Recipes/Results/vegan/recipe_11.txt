Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Whisk flour, vegetable broth, and tamari into hot oil; cook and stir until there are no lumps and the mixture becomes paste-like, about 5 minutes. Pour soy milk into the skillet; cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes more. Add yeast and black pepper; stir.
