1 pound cauliflower florets
1/4 cup mashed potato flakes
1/4 cup low-fat milk
2 tablespoons margarine
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese


Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer cauliflower to a large bowl. Add mashed potato flakes, milk, and margarine; mash with a potato masher or fork until cauliflower mixture is fluffy. Season with salt and black pepper. Pour mixture into a baking dish and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
