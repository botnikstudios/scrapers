15 small red potatoes, skin on
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
2 tablespoons butter
5 green onions, chopped
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
salt and pepper to taste


Cook potatoes in a large saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well.
Return potatoes to pan, and stir in the cream cheese, butter, and garlic salt. Use a fork to mash potatoes, leaving them fairly lumpy. Fold in green onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
