6 sweet potatoes
1/2 cup butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme


Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain.
Transfer potatoes to a large bowl; mash butter, garlic, basil, and thyme into the potatoes with a potato masher until smooth.
