1 head cauliflower
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon dry ranch salad dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces, or more to taste


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer cauliflower to a bowl, mash, and strain excess water.
Mix cauliflower, sour cream, Cheddar cheese, ranch dressing mix, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a 9-inch baking dish; top with butter.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes.
