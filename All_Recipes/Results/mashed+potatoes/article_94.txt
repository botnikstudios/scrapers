2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/4 cup toasted, ground hazelnuts
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 cup apple cider
salt and pepper to taste


Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Mash the potatoes until smooth, then stir in the hazelnuts, heavy cream, sour cream, and apple cider. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
