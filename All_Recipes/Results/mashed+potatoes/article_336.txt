1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon cream cheese at room temperature
2 teaspoons chicken soup base
2 teaspoons roasted garlic, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons butter at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon milk, or to taste (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste


Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook cauliflower florets in the boiling water until they are extremely tender, about 10 minutes; drain in a colander. Put several paper towels on top of the cauliflower and use back of a big bowl to press down and squeeze as much liquid from the cauliflower as you can.
Mix Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, chicken soup base, roasted garlic, and butter in a bowl. Add cauliflower to the cheese mixture; beat with an electric hand mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat milk into the mixture until you get your desired texture. Season with salt and pepper.
