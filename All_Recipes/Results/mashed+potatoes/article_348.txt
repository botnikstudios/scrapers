3 pounds potatoes, peeled and cut into thick wedges
1/3 cup olive oil
2 lemons, juiced
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups chicken broth


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Put potato wedges into a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice over the wedges and toss to coat. Season potatoes with salt, oregano, and black pepper; toss again to coat.
Spread potato wedges in a single layer in a 2 inch-deep pan. Pour chicken broth over the potatoes.
Roast potatoes in preheated oven until tender and golden brown, about 1 hour.
