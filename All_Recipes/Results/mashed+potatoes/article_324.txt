4 cups chopped peeled sweet potato
1 sweet onions (such as VidaliaÂ®), cut into wedges
2 cloves garlic, sliced
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or more to taste
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix sweet potatoes, sweet onion, and garlic in a bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the mixture and toss to coat; pour into a shallow roasting pan.
Roast sweet potato mixture in preheated oven, turning frequently, until the vegetables are soft and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over the vegetables; season with salt and pepper.
