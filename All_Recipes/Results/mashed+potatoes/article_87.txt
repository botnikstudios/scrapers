3 pounds red potatoes, cut into chunks
1/4 cup butter
2 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons bacon bits
1/2 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
2 tablespoons Montreal steak seasoning
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste


Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Mash the potatoes with a potato masher; mash in butter and cream cheese. Stir in milk, bacon bits, Colby-Jack cheese, and steak seasoning. Season to taste with salt.
