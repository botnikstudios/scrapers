1 large yam, peeled and cubed
1 large red potato, peeled and cubed
1 large white potato, peeled and cubed
1 large yellow potato, peeled and cubed
1 large beet, peeled and cubed
1 rutabaga, peeled and cubed (optional)
1 parsnip, peeled and cubed (optional)
1 turnip, peeled and cubed
1/4 cup butter, room temperature
1 pinch ground nutmeg (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste


Place yam, red potato, white potato, yellow potato, beet, rutabaga, parsnip, and turnip into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and return to pot.
Mash vegetable mixture and butter together with a potato masher or fork until orange-ish with streaks of red from the beets; season with nutmeg, salt, and black pepper.
