3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
1/2 cup butter
8 ounces goat cheese
3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
1/2 cup milk


Place the potatoes into a large pot and fill with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender enough to easily pierce with a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain and mash partially, then add the butter and milk. Continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the goat cheese, chives and dill.
