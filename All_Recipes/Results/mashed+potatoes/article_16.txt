1 gallon water
4 baking potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1/3 pound bacon, diced
3 shallots, minced
1/2 cup cream cheese
1/3 cup sour cream
1/4 cup butter
2 teaspoons minced garlic
kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley


Pour water into a 6-quart pot; add potatoes and 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Place pot onto a cold burner. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook potatoes at a boil until potatoes are fork-tender, about 12 minutes; drain.
Cook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel to drain. Drain grease from the skillet, reserving 2 tablespoons in the skillet. Return skillet to medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallots in reserved drippings until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
Combine the shallots with the cream cheese, sour cream, butter, and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Dump the potatoes atop the cream cheese mixture; beat with an electric hand mixer to desired consistency. Season with kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste. Transfer potatoes to a serving dish. Sprinkle parsley and bacon over the potatoes to serve.
