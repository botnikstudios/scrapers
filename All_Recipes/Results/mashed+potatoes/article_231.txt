1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, smashed
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon reduced-fat cream cheese
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper


Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until softened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Transfer half the cauliflower to a food processor; cover and blend on high. Add remaining cauliflower florets, one at a time, until vegetables are creamy. Blend in garlic, Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, salt, and black pepper.
