1 teaspoon salt
4 cups water, or as needed to cover
3 baking potatoes
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup French onion dip
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon milk, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)


Dissolve 1 teaspoon salt in water in a saucepan and add potatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to saucepan.
Mash butter, French onion dip, and garlic into potatoes, using a potato masher or fork. Mix milk into potatoes, 1 teaspoon at a time, until potatoes are your desired consistency. Season with salt and black pepper.
