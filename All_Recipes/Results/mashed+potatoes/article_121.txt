2 cups milk, or as needed
4 cups leftover mashed potatoes
2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste


Heat milk in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir mashed potatoes into the warm milk until the mixture is smooth, adding more milk as needed to make it smooth; add ham and stir. Cook the mixture until the ham cubes are hot in the middle, 5 to 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper and top with Cheddar cheese.
