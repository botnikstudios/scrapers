5 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 tablespoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup softened butter
1 cup heavy cream


Place the potatoes in a large Dutch oven, cover with water and add the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Bring the potatoes to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well.
Place the drained potatoes in a large bowl, add butter and whip the potatoes with an electric mixer until there are no lumps. Pour in the cream and continue whipping until the potatoes are fluffy.
