1 1/2 pounds new potatoes, scrubbed and quartered
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups whole kernel corn
1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach, stems removed

Place potatoes in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and add 1/4 teaspoon salt. Boil until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain water and mash potatoes together with butter and heavy cream until light and fluffy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
