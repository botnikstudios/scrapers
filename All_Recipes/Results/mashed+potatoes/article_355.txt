1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
salt and ground black pepper to taste


Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook cauliflower in the boiling water until tender, about 10 minutes; drain and set aside.
Melt butter in the same pot over medium heat. Stir cauliflower, milk, and sour cream into melted butter.
Mash cauliflower in the pot using a hand blender until creamy.
Transfer cauliflower mixture to a baking dish; evenly cover with bread crumbs and season with salt and black pepper.
Baking in the preheated oven until bread crumbs are lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
