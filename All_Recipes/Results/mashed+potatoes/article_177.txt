2 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
1 large celery root, peeled and cut into chunks
1/4 cup butter
1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream


Place potatoes and celery root into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and coarsely mash with a potato masher.
Mash butter, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper into potato mixture until desired consistency is reached. Fold cream into puree until just combined.
