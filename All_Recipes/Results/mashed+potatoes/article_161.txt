5 baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup butter
1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Transfer potatoes to a bowl; add butter, garlic powder, and parsley. Mash with a potato masher. Stir in Cheddar cheese and ham.
