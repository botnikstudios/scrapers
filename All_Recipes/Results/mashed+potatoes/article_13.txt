9 large potatoes
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup minced green onions
salt and ground black pepper, to taste


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Mash potatoes in the pot with a potato masher or fork until smooth. Stir in cream cheese, sour cream, butter, green onions, salt, and pepper. Spoon into prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until golden and bubbly, about 1 1/2 hours.
