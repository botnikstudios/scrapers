Idahoan Baby Reds with Peas:
1 (4 ounce) package IdahoanÂ® Baby Reds Flavored Mashed Potatoes
1/4 cup half and half
1 tablespoon butter, softened
Scallions, green parts, finely chopped
1 cup fresh peas or frozen peas, thawed
Spring Meatloaf:
1 1/2 pounds ground lamb or ground beef
Salt and pepper
2 slices white bread, crusts trimmed
1/4 cup milk
1 bunch scallions, white parts finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh mint, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon lemon zest
Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling


Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the meat in a large bowl and season liberally with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, soak the bread in the milk, then crumble the bread into the meat. Mix the scallion whites, parsley, mint, garlic, egg, lemon zest and a healthy drizzle of olive oil into the meat. Using your hands, form 4 mini loaves about 1 1/2-inch thick or shape into one large loaf.
Place the meatloaf on the prepared baking sheet and roast in the oven until cooked through, about 15-18 minutes. Prepare Idahoan Baby Reds following package instructions. Stir in half and half, butter, scallions and peas. Serve hot with meatloaf.
