2 pounds whole new potatoes
5 cups cold water
1 cup kosher salt
1/4 cup melted butter, or to taste


Place potatoes into a large pot and cover cold water and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain. Transfer potatoes to a plate and drizzle butter over the top.
