2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste


Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.
In a small saucepan heat butter and milk over low heat until butter is melted.  Using a potato masher or electric beater, slowly blend milk mixture into potatoes until smooth and creamy.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
