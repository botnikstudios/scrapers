1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and cut into wedges
3/4 pound broccoli crowns, chopped
3/4 cup shredded fontina cheese
1/2 cup nonfat milk, heated
1/2 teaspoon salt
Freshly ground pepper to taste


Bring an inch of water to a boil in a large saucepan fitted with a steamer basket. Add potatoes, cover and steam for 10 minutes. Place broccoli on top, cover and steam until the potatoes and broccoli are tender, 6 to 8 minutes more.
Transfer the broccoli to a large bowl and coarsely mash with a potato masher. Add the potatoes, cheese, milk, salt and pepper and continue mashing to desired consistency. Serve immediately.
