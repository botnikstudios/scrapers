3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 (2.64 ounce) package country gravy mix
1/3 cup water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated skim milk

Place potatoes into a slow cooker, and sprinkle with black pepper. Stir together the gravy mix and water in a measuring cup until well blended. Pour this over the potatoes, then pour in the evaporated mink. Stir to blend. Cover, and cook for 4 hours on Low. When finished, drain any excess liquid. Mash potatoes with a potato masher, and stir in the butter.
