7 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 1/2 pounds rutabagas, peeled and cubed
1 1/4 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
8 cloves garlic
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon dried thyme
3/4 cup butter, softened
3 onions, thinly sliced
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste


Combine chicken broth, potatoes, rutabagas, parsnips, cloves, bay leaf, and thyme in a large pot. Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, and cover partially.  Simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes. Drain.
Transfer vegetables to large bowl. Add 1/2 cup butter or margarine . Use an electric mixer, beat mixture until mashed but still chunky.  Season with salt and pepper. Transfer mashed vegetables to a buttered 13 x 9 x 2 inch baking dish.
Melt remaining 1/4 cup butter or margarine in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced onions.  Saute until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Saute until onions are tender and golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spread onions evenly over mashed vegetables. Casserole can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Bake, uncovered, for 25 minutes, or until heated through and top begins to crisp.
