2 pounds new yellow potatoes, halved
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
3 cloves garlic, whole, peeled, bruised
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 pinch kosher salt


Place potatoes in a large pot with water. Bruise the rosemary with the dull side of a knife blade and place in the pot. Add garlic, bay leaves, and salt. Bring to a boil; simmer for 5 minutes. Drain; let potatoes air dry.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
When potatoes are thoroughly dry, transfer them back to the pot. Drizzle with olive oil, cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt. Stir to coat. Transfer potatoes to a rimmed sheet pan. Bake until potatoes are golden brown and crusty, and the flesh is creamy and soft, about 35 to 45 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes.
