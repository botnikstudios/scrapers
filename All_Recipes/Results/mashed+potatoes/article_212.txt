1 teaspoon butter
10 russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
salt to taste
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (3 ounce) package real bacon bits
2 tablespoons chopped chives (optional)


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with butter.
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.
Season potatoes with salt and mash until smooth. Stir in sour cream and cream cheese. Stir in 1 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and bacon bits. Spread potato mixture in the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese on top; continue baking until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes more. Garnish with chives.
