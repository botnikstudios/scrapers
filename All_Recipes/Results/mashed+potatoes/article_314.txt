2 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 3/4 cups milk
3 tablespoons real bacon bits
1 tablespoon dried parsley, or to taste


Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, water, dill weed, salt, and pepper to onion; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender and water is almost all evaporated, at least 30 minutes.
Stir milk and bacon bits into potato mixture; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir parsley into soup.
