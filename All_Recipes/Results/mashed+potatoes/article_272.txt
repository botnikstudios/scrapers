1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 large potatoes, peeled and cubed


Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
Combine oil, garlic, basil, rosemary, parsley, red pepper flakes, and salt in a large bowl. Toss in potatoes until evenly coated. Place potatoes in a single layer on a roasting pan or baking sheet.
Roast in preheated oven, turning occasionally, until potatoes are brown on all sides, 20 to 30 minutes.
