3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
3/4 cup milk
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
1/2 cup white chocolate baking discs
4 ounces shredded extra-sharp white Cheddar cheese
salt to taste


Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Combine milk and vanilla bean in a saucepan over medium-heat. When the milk begins to bubble, remove and discard the vanilla bean. Add chocolate chips to milk; whisk continuously until chocolate is melted.
Mash potatoes in a large bowl. Add milk-chocolate mixture to potatoes and stir until combined. Add cheese and mash together with potatoes; season with salt.
