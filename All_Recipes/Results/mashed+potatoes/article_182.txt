2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
3/4 cup milk, warmed
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg


Combine russet potatoes and sweet potatoes in a large pot. Pour enough water over the potatoes to cover; add chicken bouillon. Bring water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes; drain.
Dump drained potatoes in a large bowl; add milk, butter, brown sugar, salt, pepper, allspice, and nutmeg. Whip the potato mixture with a potato masher or immersion blender until a desired consistency is reached.
