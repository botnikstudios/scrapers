1 1/2 pounds red potatoes, cut into large chunks
1 clove garlic, halved lengthwise
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley


Place the potatoes and garlic into a large pot, and just cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, and cover. Simmer until very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.  Allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Return the potatoes to the pot. Pour in milk, and season with salt; mash until smooth. Stir in the parsley.
