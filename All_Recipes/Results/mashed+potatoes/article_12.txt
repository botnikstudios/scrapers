5 pounds red potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup butter
salt and pepper to taste


Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, add butter, and mash using a potato masher, ricer or mixer. Gradually beat in the heavy cream. Serve hot!
