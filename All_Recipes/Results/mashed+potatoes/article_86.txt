2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup chopped fresh chives
salt and pepper to taste


Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water  to come up 2 inches from the bottom. Bring to a boil, and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, until fork tender. Drain, and mash. Mix in the milk using a potato masher or an electric mixer until fluffy. Stir in the sour cream and chives, and season with salt and pepper.
