8 red potatoes, cubed
2 teaspoons crushed garlic
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup half-and-half cream
1/4 teaspoon steak seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon white sugar


Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Add 1 teaspoon of the crushed garlic to the water for flavor. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork.
Drain the potatoes, and add the butter. Mash until the butter is melted. Mix in the half-and-half, steak seasoning, garlic powder, sugar, and remaining garlic. Mix potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth.
