15 potatoes, peeled
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
10 slices smoked streaky bacon, cut into small pieces
1/2 (8 ounce) round Camembert cheese (such as Cooleeney Irish Camembert)
2 ounces grated white Cheddar cheese
1 spring onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup light cream, divided
2 tablespoons butter
salt and cracked black pepper to taste


Place potatoes in a pot of cold water. Cover and set over high heat; boil until easily pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain well and cover with a clean dish towel for 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon until very crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Transfer bacon to a blender; blend into tiny pieces.
Break Camembert cheese into small lumps; mix with Cheddar cheese and spring onion in a bowl.
Mash potatoes until smooth. Stir bacon, Camembert cheese mixture, half of the cream, and butter into the mashed potatoes. Season with salt and pepper.
Spread mashed potato mixture in a baking dish. Pour remaining cream on top. Pierce in several places with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top starts to brown, about 15 minutes.
