2 pounds unpeeled potatoes, cubed
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons sour cream
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
2 teaspoons dried basil
salt and pepper to taste


Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
Drain potatoes, and transfer to a bowl. Add butter, and mash with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are starting to become smooth. Add milk and sour cream, and mix to your desired texture. Careful not to over mix the potatoes once they are creamy. Season with garlic, basil, salt and pepper.
