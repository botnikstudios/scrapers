3 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
3/4 cup reduced fat sour cream
1/2 cup nonfat milk
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
garlic salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste


Place the cubed potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 15 minutes, or until tender.
Drain potatoes and transfer to a bowl. Mash with a potato masher, and gradually mix in the sour cream, nonfat milk, and Dijon mustard. Season with garlic salt and pepper.
