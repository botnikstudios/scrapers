1 medium head garlic
1/2 cup low fat, low sodium chicken broth
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup warm skim milk
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
salt and pepper to taste


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Slice the top off the head of garlic to expose the cloves. Place the whole head and the broth in a small casserole dish and cover. Bake for 1 hour; remove dish from the oven and set aside.
Boil the cubed potatoes in water for 20 minutes or until soft. Drain. Add the warm milk and olive oil. Beat with mixer until potatoes are fluffy. Add the herbs.
Gently squeeze the garlic out from each of the cloves, leaving behind the skins. Add all the garlic pulp to the potatoes. Beat again and season with salt and pepper.
