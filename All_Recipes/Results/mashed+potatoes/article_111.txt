4 potatoes, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 (6 ounce) can French-fried onions, crushed


Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash.
In a large mixing bowl combine mashed potatoes, cream cheese, onion, eggs, flour, salt and pepper. Using an electric mixer, beat on medium speed for several minutes.  Spoon mixture into a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish and top with crushed fried onions.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes.
