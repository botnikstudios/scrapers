2 large russet potatoes
1 cup prepared spinach artichoke dip
1/2 cup shredded Irish Cheddar cheese


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pierce the potatoes in a couple of places with a sharp knife; place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife easily slices through the potato, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool potatoes for 10 minutes.
Slice potatoes horizontally; scoop out the flesh with a fork, leaving the skin intact. Mix potato flesh with spinach artichoke dip in a bowl; spoon back into the potato skins and top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the oven until cheese is beginning to melt, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn on oven's broiler and broil until cheese begin to bubble and brown, 2 to 5 minutes.
