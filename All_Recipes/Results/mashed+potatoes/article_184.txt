4 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
4 ounces Neufchatel cheese (such as Organic ValleyÂ®), softened
1/2 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste


Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with cold water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes; drain and transfer potatoes to a large mixing bowl.
Beat potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth; add cream cheese and beat again until smooth. Season potatoes with sea salt.
