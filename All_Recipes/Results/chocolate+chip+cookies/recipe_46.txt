Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with baking parchment paper.
Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Beat butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat 1 egg into butter mixture. Beat second egg into mixture along with the vanilla extract; add flour mixture and stir until it just forms a batter. Fold chocolate chips, quinoa flakes, oat bran, and cream through the batter to distribute throughout.
Roll dough into small balls and arrange on prepared baking sheet with at least 2 inches between balls.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let cookies cool on pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
