Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition; stir in vanilla extract.
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; gradually stir into the creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed. Fold pistachios and white chocolate chips into the dough.
Drop spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
