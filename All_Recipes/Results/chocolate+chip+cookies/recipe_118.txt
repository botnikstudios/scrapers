Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cream together white sugar, brown sugar and shortening until fluffy. Stir in the vanilla and eggs. Combine the flour, wheat germ, salt and baking soda; mix into the batter. Stir in crispy rice cereal and chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls on an ungreased cookie sheet, spacing cookies 2 inches apart.
Bake for 11 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are light brown at the edges. Cool well before eating as the chocolate can burn your mouth.
