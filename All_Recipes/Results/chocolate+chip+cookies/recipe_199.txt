Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat brown sugar, vegetable oil butter spread, and egg with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Stir in vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt. Add coconut, flour, and oats; stir until just moistened. Fold in chocolate chips, almonds, and yogurt.
Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 9 to 11 minutes.
