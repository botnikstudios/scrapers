Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, beat together the melted butter, egg, vanilla extract and Sugar In The Raw(R) (or Sugar In The Raw(R)/Stevia In The Raw(R) combo).
Meanwhile, mix dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt) in a separate bowl. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and stir well to combine. Slowly add nuts and chocolate chips until well combined.
Drop the dough in spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 10 minutes.
