In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars. Mix until smooth. Add the vanilla and the eggs and beat well. Gradually add the flour mixture until well combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped candy bars. Mix until combined.
Drop spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes. Immediately remove the cookies from the sheet and let them cool on racks.
