Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon butter.
Beat 1 cup softened butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat one egg into the batter until fully integrated. Add second egg with vanilla extract; beat until smooth.
Dissolve baking soda into hot water in a small bowl; stir into the batter along with the heavy cream. Add flour and chocolate chips into the batter; stir vigorously for 20 seconds. Stir the cookie spread through the batter.
Drop batter onto prepared baking sheet in portions spaced about 1-inch apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cookies cool for 5 minutes on sheet before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
