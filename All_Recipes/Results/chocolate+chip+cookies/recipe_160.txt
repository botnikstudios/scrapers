Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat coconut oil, brown sugar, and white sugar until creamy and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add applesauce and vanilla extract; mix well. Add flour, baking soda, and salt; mix until well combined. Fold in chocolate chips.
Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are brown and tops look a little undercooked, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes more.
