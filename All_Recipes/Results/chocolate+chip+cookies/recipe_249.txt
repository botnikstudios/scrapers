Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Stir in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, rolled oats, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture. Then stir in the chocolate chips. Fold the cocoa powder in slightly, to create a marbled effect.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet before removing to cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight container.
