Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper.
Sift together flour and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.
Beat melted butter, yogurt, brown sugar, and white sugar in a bowl until blended. Beat in vanilla extract, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy; mix in flour mixture until just blended. Stir in chocolate chips, blueberries, and cranberries by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop 1/4 cup cookie dough 3-inches apart on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are lightly toasted, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
