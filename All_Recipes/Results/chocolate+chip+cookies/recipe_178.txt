Preheat oven to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix almond butter, almond flour, palm sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl; fold in chocolate chips. Roll dough into 24 balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Press each ball lightly with a fork dipped in water to form fork marks.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
