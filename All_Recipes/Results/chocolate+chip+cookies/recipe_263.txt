Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt and cocoa. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients until just moistened, then stir in the peanut butter chips. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cookies to cool on a wire rack.
