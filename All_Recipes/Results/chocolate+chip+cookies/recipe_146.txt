Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
Mix flour and baking soda together in a bowl.
Beat butter, brown sugar, pudding mix, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in eggs. Stir in flour mixture gradually. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into the batter.
Pour batter into the springform pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Cool before cutting, about 20 minutes.
