Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the flour and baking soda; set aside.
Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the instant pudding mix until well combined. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips, cherries, and pistachios. Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased baking pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 10 minutes.
