Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, mix together the butter, honey, and powdered milk with an electric mixer. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the honey mixture using a large spoon. Mix in pecans and chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 7 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. Cookies will not spread very much. Cool for a minute on the cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
