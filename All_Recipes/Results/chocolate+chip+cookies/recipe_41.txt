Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray baking sheets with cooking spray.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat white sugar, brown sugar, butter, avocado, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy; beat in egg until smooth. Stir flour mixture, a few tablespoons at a time, into creamed mixture until dough is just mixed; stir in chocolate chips. Drop dough by the spoonful onto the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
