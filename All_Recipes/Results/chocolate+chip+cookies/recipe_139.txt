Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk both amounts of flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, and pudding mix in another bowl with an electric mixer until blended; beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract until combined. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips.
Roll the dough into 2-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
