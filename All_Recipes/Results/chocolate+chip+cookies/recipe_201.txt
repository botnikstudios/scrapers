Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a bowl; beat it eggs and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Stir flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder into the creamed butter mixture until batter is well mixed. Fold chocolate chips into batter; spread into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool before cutting into bars.
