Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush a cast iron skillet with melted coconut oil.
Place butter into a large mixing bowl; spread with the back of a wooden spoon. Add coconut sugar; mix together with a fork until well incorporated. Pour in almond flour, tapioca flour, baking soda, and sea salt; stir, first with a fork then switch to a wooden spoon, until combined.
Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a bowl until evenly blended. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour egg mixture into well and stir until dough is combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Pour into skillet; spread evenly with a wooden spoon.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
