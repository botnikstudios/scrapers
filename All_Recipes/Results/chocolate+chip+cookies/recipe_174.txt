In large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, then stir in the creme de menthe liqueur. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the mint mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop dough by heaping teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
