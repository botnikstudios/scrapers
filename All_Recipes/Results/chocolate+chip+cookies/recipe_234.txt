Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix peanut butter, eggs, chocolate chips, honey, coconut flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl; drop by heaping tablespoon onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Turn baking sheet and continue baking until cookies are crisp around the edges, about 3 minutes more.
