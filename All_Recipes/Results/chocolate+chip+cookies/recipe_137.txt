Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, cocoa nibs, honey, prunes, vanilla extract, baking powder, and sea salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Scoop batter using a cookie scoop and drop into a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, about 8 minutes.
