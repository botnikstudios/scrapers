Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat brown sugar, coconut sugar, butter, and coconut oil with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into creamed butter mixture until completely blended; beat in vanilla extract with the last egg.
Stir hot water and baking soda together in a small bowl until baking soda is dissolved; stir into butter mixture. Add cream of tartar and mix well.
Mix flour into butter mixture until dough is smooth; fold in walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds, cocoa nibs, and salt. Drop dough by rounded tablespoons onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned around the edges, about 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool.
