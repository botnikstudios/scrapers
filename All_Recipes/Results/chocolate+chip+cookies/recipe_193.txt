Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk almond flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Stir grapeseed oil, agave nectar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Mix oil mixture into almond flour mixture until dough is just combined. Fold chocolate chips into batter.
Form dough into 1/2-inch balls and press onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
