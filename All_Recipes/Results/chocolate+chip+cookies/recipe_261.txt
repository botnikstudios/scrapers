Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 2 nonstick muffin tins with cooking spray.
Combine oats, trail mix, chocolate chips, raisins, and protein powder in a large bowl. Add maple-flavored syrup, honey, salt, and vanilla extract; stir until dough is thoroughly and evenly mixed.
Press dough firmly into the bottom of each muffin cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 6 minutes.
