Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.
Sift flour, baking powder and salt into and set aside.  Cream butter, sugars, orange zest and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
Add eggs one at a time beating well after adding each one.  Add dry ingredients and stir until combined.  Stir in chocolate chips and nuts and mix until well blended.
Drop dough by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart on cookie sheets.  Flatten slightly.  Bake cookies for 15 or 16 minutes or until golden. Cool on the cookie sheets.
