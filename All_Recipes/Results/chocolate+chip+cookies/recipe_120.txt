Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone liner. Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
In a large bowl, mash vegetable shortening and sugar together until smooth and creamy; mix in the egg and molasses. Stir the flour mixture into the molasses mixture to make a smooth dough, and mix in the chocolate chips. Drop by scant tablespoon or small dough scoop about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool on sheets 1 to 2 minutes before removing to finish cooling on wire racks.
