Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add eggs and vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Fold almond flour, baking soda, and salt into butter mixture until dough comes together. Stir in chocolate chips and cranberries. Drop dough by the teaspoonful onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, about 12 minutes.
