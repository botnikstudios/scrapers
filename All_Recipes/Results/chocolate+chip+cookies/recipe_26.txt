Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Cream butter or margarine and sugars.  Add already beaten eggs and vanilla.
Mix dry ingredients together and mix with creamed mixture.  Add chocolate chips and nuts.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes until done.   These are not HOT HOT --   Just a little surprise, definitely a little kick, goes well with the chocolate.
