Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together the cake mix, eggs, oil, raisins, oatmeal and chocolate chips.  Stir well.
Drop by teaspoonful onto a greased cookie sheet (Baking stones yield best results).   Bake for about 8-10 minutes.
Remove from oven and let cool for 1 minute before removing from cookie sheet.  NOTE:  For even more chocolate, put a large chocolate kiss in the center of each cookie 1 minute before removing from oven.
