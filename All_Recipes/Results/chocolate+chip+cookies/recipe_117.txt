Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter flavored shortening, water, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg whites and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Blend in the oats and mini chocolate chips. Drop dough by half-teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 7 to 9 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges begin to brown. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. Cool at least 10 minutes before eating.
