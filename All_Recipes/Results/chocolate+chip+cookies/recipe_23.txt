Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the cake mix into a large bowl. Stir in the butter, eggs and vanilla with an electric mixer until well blended.  Stir in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto cookie sheets.
Bake for 11 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are golden. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before removing to cool on wire racks.
