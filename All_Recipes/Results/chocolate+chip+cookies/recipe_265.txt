Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine sorghum flour, rice flour, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt together in a large bowl.
Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat eggs one at a time into the butter mixture; add vanilla extract. Pour butter mixture over flour mixture. Beat together until combined, about 2 minutes. Fold chocolate chips and hemp seeds into the cookie dough.
Place cookie dough in the refrigerator to firm up, at least 20 minutes.
Drop heaping tablespoons of dough 2 inches apart on baking sheets; press down with the back of the spoon to flatten slightly.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookie edges are lightly golden, 8 to 11 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool before taking off the parchment paper, about 10 minutes. Cool baking sheet before re-using for another batch.
