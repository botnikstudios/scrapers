Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).   Grease cookie sheets with non-stick cooking spray (I use butter flavored) and set aside.
Combine cream cheese, margarine, and sugars.  Blend in egg and vanilla.  Add dry ingredients and mix well.  Add chocolate chips and mix.
 Bake 15-18 minutes or until edges are slightly browned.  Enjoy!
