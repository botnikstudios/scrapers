Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, stir together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until creamy and smooth. Stir in vanilla; then stir in eggs one at a time, stirring until the mixture is creamy and well incorporated. Gradually stir in the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well between each addition. Stir in the semi-sweet chips, then the bittersweet chips. Mix in the peppermint candy, stirring until evenly distributed. Drop by spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in a preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven; allow cookies to cool momentarily on the sheets before removing them to wire racks to cool completely.
