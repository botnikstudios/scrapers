Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Beat in the eggs until batter is smooth and well blended. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; mix into the batter alternately with the water. Stir in chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookies by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are golden brown. Remove cookies from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
