Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk almond butter, honey, egg, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl; fold in chocolate chips. Drop batter, about 2 tablespoons per cookie, onto the prepared baking sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing.
