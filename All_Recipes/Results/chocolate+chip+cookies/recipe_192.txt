Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat butter and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer or in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Mix eggs and vanilla extract into creamed butter mixture. Add almond flour, coconut flour, salt, and baking soda to creamed butter mixture and stir until dough is well mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Drop dough by the rounded teaspoon onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are browned, 8 to 12 minutes.
