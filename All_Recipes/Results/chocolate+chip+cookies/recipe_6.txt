Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat butter, sugar, and persimmon pulp together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; beat  in eggs and vanilla extract. Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; add gradually to persimmon mixture until dough is thoroughly combined. Stir in chocolate chips. Drop spoonfuls of dough 1 inch apart onto lined baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 10 to 13 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
