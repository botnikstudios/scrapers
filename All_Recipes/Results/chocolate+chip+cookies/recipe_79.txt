Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Mix flour, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir the flour mixture slowly into the butter mixture until well combined; fold in chocolate chips. Place spoonfuls of dough onto a nonstick baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
