Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, set aside.
 In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar. Beat in the eggs, vanilla and honey. Stir in the dry ingredients, then fold in the chocolate chips, chocolate candies,  peanut butter chips and nuts. Drop dough by teaspoons onto an unprepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cookies are golden around the edges. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
