Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Cream together butter and brown sugar. Beat in eggs, peanut butter and vanilla.
Add flour, cornstarch, salt, baking soda and baking powder.  Stir in chocolate chips.
Roll into balls about 1 1/2 teaspoonfuls (or use cookie scoop) and place onto ungreased cookie sheets about 2 inches apart.  Flatten slightly because they do not flatten much while cooking.
Bake for 10 minutes.
