Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Beat shortening, honey, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add egg and vanilla extract; beat until light and fluffy.
Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; stir into honey mixture until just incorporated and dough comes together. Fold chocolate chips and almonds into dough. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges just begin to brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
