Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together the sugar, brown sugar, and eggs until creamy. Melt the butter or margarine in a saucepan over low heat and mix into the sugar along with the vanilla. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the batter until it becomes dough. Mix in chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until browned at the edges.
