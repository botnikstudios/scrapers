Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir together the flour, baking soda, salt and cocoa; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, cream cheese, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and applesauce. Blend in the dry ingredients to form a dough. Fold in the peanut butter chips by hand. Drop the dough by teaspoons two inches apart on a ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
