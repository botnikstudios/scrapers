Beat eggs into butter mixture until smooth. Stir rice flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and salt into butter mixture. Add oats; stir until dough is thick and well-combined. Stir in chocolate chips. Drop dough by the tablespoonful onto prepared baking sheet.
