Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper and set aside.
Whisk together flour, kosher salt, baking powder and baking soda; set aside. Mix butter, light brown sugar and granulated sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla and beat. Slowly add flour mixture, mixing gently until incorporated. Fold in caramel filled chocolate candies and chocolate chips.
Roll 2 tablespoons of dough into a ball, covering any candies with dough so they are not exposed.
Place dough balls on parchment lined baking sheets. Bake cookies for 10-12 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 5 minutes and transfer parchment paper with cookies onto wire racks to cool completely.
