Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
In a large mixing bowl, mash the butter with white sugar and brown sugar until the mixture is well combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and stir in vanilla extract. Stir in the flour mixture, about 1 cup at a time, then mix in the chocolate chips. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoon onto baking sheets, about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool for about 5 minutes on the baking sheets before removing cookies to finish cooling.
