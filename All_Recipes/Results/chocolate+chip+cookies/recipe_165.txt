Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.
Combine the brown sugar, baking soda, salt, and butter, and mix until smooth.
Mix in the vanilla, egg, and almond flour, stirring to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix for 1 minute at medium speed.
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Scoop the dough one level tablespoon at a time onto the prepared baking sheet; a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here.
Gently flatten the cookies to about 3/8-inch thick.
Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes, until golden brown.
Remove the cookies from the oven. Allow them to cool on the pan for 2 minutes, then carefully transfer them to a rack to cool completely.
