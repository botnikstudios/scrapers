In a large bowl, beat butter, eggs, and vanilla until well blended. Beat in the brown sugar and confectioners' sugar. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, stir into the sugar mixture. Finally, stir in the oats and chocolate chips. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Place the cookies 2 inches apart onto the cookie sheets.
