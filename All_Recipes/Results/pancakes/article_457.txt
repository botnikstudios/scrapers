3 cups sorghum flour
1 cup tapioca starch
1/4 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 chicken eggs, separated
2 duck eggs, separated
3 1/2 cups unsweetened vanilla-flavored almond milk
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
cooking spray


Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray iron with cooking spray.
Mix sorghum flour, tapioca starch, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt in a large bowl.
Beat chicken and duck egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.
Beat egg yolks, almond milk, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Continue beating while gradually adding the flour mixture; blend until smooth. Fold the egg whites into the batter.
Pour 2/3 cup batter onto preheated waffle iron. Cook until golden brown.
