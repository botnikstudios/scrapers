1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups whole milk
1/4 cup crushed gingersnap cookies (optional)
3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
3 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Whisk flour, milk, gingersnaps, peanut butter, butter, sugar, egg, baking powder, ginger, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth batter forms.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Pour 1/2 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
