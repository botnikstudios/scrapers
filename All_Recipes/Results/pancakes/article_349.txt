1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup instant cream of wheat
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Sift together the flour, cream of wheat, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; set bowl aside. Whisk together the milk, sour cream, vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and stir in the wet ingredients. Do not overmix the batter.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/3 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.
