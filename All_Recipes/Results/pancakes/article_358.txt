1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips


Whisk flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.  Beat eggs, milk, and vanilla in another bowl; mix in the melted butter.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and mix just until combined.  Stir in the chocolate chips.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.  For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter on griddle and cook until bubbles pop in the center of the pancake, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Flip, and cook an additional minute on the opposite side.
