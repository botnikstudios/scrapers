3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
3 eggs
3 cups milk
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon vegetable oil


Mix flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl.
Whisk eggs in a separate bowl until smooth. Mix in milk, molasses, coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk flour mixture into milk mixture until batter is combined; a few lumps are okay.
Grease a griddle lightly with oil; preheat over medium-low heat.
Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
