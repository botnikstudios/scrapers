2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
2 eggs
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce


Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.
Whisk milk, eggs, and applesauce together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
