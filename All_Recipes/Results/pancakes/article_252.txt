1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon maple syrup
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cloves
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed


Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk milk, egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until just blended.
Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil on a griddle over medium heat; pour about 1/4 cup batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles begin to form on top of pancakes, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until second side is golden brown, 3 to 5 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
