1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup soy milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons flax seeds
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Stir flour, soy milk, egg, flax seeds, baking powder, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
