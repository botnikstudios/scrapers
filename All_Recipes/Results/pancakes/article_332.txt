2 cups complete buttermilk pancake mix
1 tablespoon French vanilla flavored powdered non-dairy creamer
2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup soy milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon honey


In a medium bowl, mix together the pancake mix, coffee creamer, and cinnamon sugar. Add the water, soy milk, honey and vanilla; mix until just blended, but do not over mix or the pancakes will be tough.
Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Spray with non-stick cooking spray. Use about 2 tablespoons of batter per pancake, and spoon onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and brown on the other side.
