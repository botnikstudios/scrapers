1 cup KamutÂ® flour
1/8 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 pinches salt
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1/4 cup coconut milk
3/4 cup warm water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract


Sift together the Kamut(R) flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the mayonnaise, coconut milk, water, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture; stir to combine, but do not over-stir. The batter should be lumpy.
Preheat a griddle or place a large skillet over medium heat; lightly grease the cooking surface.
Measure batter onto the heated cooking surface in about 1/4 cup portions, leaving 1 to 2 inches between each pancake. Allow to cook until bubbles form on the top of the cake; flip and cook 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
