1 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon chocolate chips (such as Enjoy LifeÂ®), or more to taste (optional)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste (optional)
1 egg
1 egg white
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup water, or as needed


Preheat a lightly oiled griddle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk almond flour, chocolate chips, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk egg, egg white, honey, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture, adding enough water to reach a pancake batter consistency.
Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the prepared griddle and cook until pancakes are golden brown and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
