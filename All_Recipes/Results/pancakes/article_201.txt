2 bananas, mashed
1 cup sunflower seed butter
2 eggs
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or more to taste
1 tablespoon arrowroot flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda


Combine bananas, sunflower seed butter, eggs, maple syrup, arrowroot flour, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and baking soda together in a bowl until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
