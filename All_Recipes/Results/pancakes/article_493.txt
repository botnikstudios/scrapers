Crepe Batter:
1/2 cup whole or 2% milk
1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 teaspoons hazelnut liqueur
1 tablespoon cocoa
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup white flour
Chocolate Sauce:
1/2 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon whole or 2% milk
2 teaspoons hazelnut liqueur
1 tablespoon cocoa
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
2 ripe bananas, sliced


In a medium bowl, stir together 1/2 cup milk, 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter, egg yolk, vanilla, and 2 teaspoons hazelnut liqueur. Whisk 1 tablespoon cocoa into liquid until completely incorporated. Next, whisk in 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar until completely incorporated. Then gradually whisk in flour until completely incorporated. Set aside.
Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir 1 tablespoon milk and 2 teaspoons hazelnut liqueur into melted butter. Stir in 1 tablespoon cocoa and 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar. Set over very low heat to keep warm.
Spray a non-stick frying pan or crepe pan with cooking spray, and heat over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan, and swirl to form a very thin disk; cook for about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook about 1 minute more.
Place crepe on a plate. Add 1/4 sliced bananas to crepe, and spoon 1/4 of the chocolate sauce over the bananas. Roll or fold crepe, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Repeat steps 3 and 4. Serve crepes warm.
