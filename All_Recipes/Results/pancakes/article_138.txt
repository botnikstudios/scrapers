3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup almond meal
1/4 cup old-fashioned oats
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk
1 ripe banana, mashed
1 tablespoon canola oil


Preheat griddle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix whole wheat flour, almond meal, oats, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
Beat an egg in a separate bowl. Beat milk, banana, and canola oil into the beaten egg; pour into flour mixture and stir until just combined into a lumpy batter.
Pour batter 1/2-cupful at a time onto the hot griddle; cook until edges become crisp and bubbles have formed on the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the pancakes and continue cooking until the bottom of the pancakes are browned, 3 to 5 minutes more.
