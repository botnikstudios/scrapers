1 (24 ounce) carton cottage cheese
2 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and chopped
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups milk
2 eggs
2 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 fresh peaches, pitted and sliced


Stir together the cottage cheese, chopped peaches, 3 tablespoons white sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the almond extract in a bowl until evenly combined. Stir together the sour cream and brown sugar in a separate bowl. Refrigerate both fillings until ready to use.
Whisk together the flour, 1 tablespoon of white sugar, the baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the nutmeg in a bowl. Beat the eggs, milk, butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until no lumps remain.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle to form silver dollar-sized blintzes. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
To assemble, spread 1 tablespoon of peach filling on top of each blintz. Stack together 5 blintzes to make a serving portion, and spoon the sweetened sour cream overtop. Garnish with peach slices.
