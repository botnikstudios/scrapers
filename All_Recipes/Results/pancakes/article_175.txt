3 eggs
3 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup butter, melted


In a large bowl, beat eggs with sugar until thick and pale.  Beat in flour and cream, alternately.  Fold in melted butter.
Heat a skillet over high heat.  Ladle batter onto hot skillet, tilting to coat entire surface.  Cook 2 minutes, turning once when edges get crispy (the second side will take about 30 seconds).
