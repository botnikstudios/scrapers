4 cups all-purpose flour
4 cups lukewarm milk
2 large eggs, whisked
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)
2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt


Pour flour into a large bowl; slowly stir milk into flour. Add whisked eggs, butter, and oil and mix to form a smooth pancake batter. Stir vanilla extract, yeast, and salt into batter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, set bowl in a warm place, and let rise until doubled in volume, 1 to 3 hours.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by 1/4-cup onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
