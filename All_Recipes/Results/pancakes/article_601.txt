1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup wheat bran
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon apple pie spice
3/4 cup water
1 teaspoon honey
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 medium apples, grated
3 tablespoons applesauce
1 cup skim milk
2 egg whites


In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, wheat bran, salt and apple pie spice. Set aside. In a separate bowl, stir together the water and honey. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface, and let stand for about 5 minutes to dissolve.
When the yeast has dissolved, stir in the apples, applesauce, milk and egg whites until well blended. Stir this mixture into the dry ingredients. Cover, and let rest for about 15 minutes.
Heat the waffle iron, and coat with cooking spray. Spoon the waffle batter onto the iron in the amount recommended by the manufacturer. Close the iron, and cook for about 7 minutes, or until the steam stops coming out and the waffle can be easily removed. Continue with remaining batter.
