1 cup grated potato
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup diced tomato
1/3 cup chickpea flour (besan)
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste
2 tablespoons cooking oil


Stir potato, parsley, tomato, chickpea flour, and egg together in a bowl until well-combined. Stir in cumin, garam masala, black pepper, and salt until batter is thick and evenly-mixed.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, drop batter by the heaping tablespoon into hot skillet and cook, turning once, until lightly browned on each side, about 6 minutes.
