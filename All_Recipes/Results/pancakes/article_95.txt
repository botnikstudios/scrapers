2 large eggs, separated
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup almond meal
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch sea salt


Beat egg whites in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form.
Beat cream, egg yolks, almond meal, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl until smooth and creamy. Fold egg whites into cream mixture until batter is just mixed.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
