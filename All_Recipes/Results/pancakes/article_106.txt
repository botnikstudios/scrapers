1 banana, mashed
1 egg
1 teaspoon arrowroot powder


Blend banana, egg, and arrowroot powder in a blender until well mixed.
Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Divide batter into two portions; ladle onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form, 2 to 3 minutes; flip and brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more.
