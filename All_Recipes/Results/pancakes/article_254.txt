1/3 cup bulk Italian sausage
3 eggs, at room temperature
2/3 cup whole milk, at room temperature
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons unsalted butter - melted, cooled, and divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch cracked black pepper
1/3 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon sliced fresh chives
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a 12-inch cast iron skillet into the oven while it preheats.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Combine eggs, milk, flour, 1 tablespoon butter, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend until batter is smooth and thin, about 2 minutes.
Carefully remove cast iron skillet from oven using an oven mitt and pour remaining 1 tablespoon butter into the skillet, quickly and carefully swirling to coat the skillet with butter. Pour batter into the skillet and transfer to the oven.
Bake in the oven until puffed around the edges and cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes.
Top Dutch baby with Cheddar cheese, chives, fresh thyme, and crumbled sausage. Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Slice and serve Dutch baby immediately.
