1 cup buckwheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1 large egg, beaten
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or as needed


Whisk buckwheat flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Beat buttermilk, egg, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Pour flour mixture into buttermilk mixture; whisk until batter is thick and smooth. Let batter rest for 5 minutes until bubbles form and batter relaxes.
Melt butter on a griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
