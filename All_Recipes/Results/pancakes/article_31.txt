1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup milk
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon vegetable oil


Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.
Whisk milk, pumpkin, egg, and oil together in a bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture and stir until just moistened. Batter will be slightly lumpy.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
