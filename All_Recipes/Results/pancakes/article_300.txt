1 ripe banana, mashed
2 tablespoons ground flax seeds, or more to taste
4 eggs
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter


Mix banana and ground flax seeds together in a bowl. Add eggs, baking powder, and cinnamon; beat together until combined.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Drop small spoonfuls of batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles form and edges look dry, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
