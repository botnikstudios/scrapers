10 russet potatoes, peeled and shredded
1 carrot, peeled and shredded
1 onion, finely diced
5 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups dry bread crumbs
salt and pepper to taste
olive oil for frying, as needed


Mix potatoes, carrot, onion, garlic, parsley, and dill in a large bowl. Stir in lemon juice, 1/4 cup of olive oil, flour, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Knead just until mixture holds together.
Heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, drop spoonfuls of potato mixture in hot oil. Cook approximately 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Serve hot.
