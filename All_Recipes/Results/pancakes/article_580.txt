1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup skim milk
4 egg whites
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
olive oil cooking spray
1 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon jelly
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste


Whisk flour, milk, egg whites, olive oil, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until batter is smooth.
Lightly spray a skillet with cooking spray and set over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet and rotate skillet so batter spreads to the edges in a thin layer. Cook until bottom is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook other side until bottom is lightly browned, about 2 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
Mix Greek yogurt and jelly together in a bowl. Spoon a layer of yogurt mixture onto each crepe; roll crepe around filling. Place rolled crepes on serving plates and top with remaining yogurt mixture. Sprinkle each crepe with cinnamon.
