3 tablespoons margarine
3 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 peach, sliced
1/4 cup white sugar, or to taste


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Put margarine in a pie dish and melt in the preheating oven.
Mix eggs, flour, and milk in a bowl; pour over melted butter. Arrange peach slices atop the egg mixture. Sprinkle sugar over the peach slices.
Bake in preheated oven until the pancake is firm in the center, about 30 minutes.
