6 ounces Greek yogurt
1 egg
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda


Whisk yogurt in a bowl until smooth creamy; add egg and whisk to combine.
Whisk flour and baking soda together in a bowl; add to yogurt mixture and stir until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
