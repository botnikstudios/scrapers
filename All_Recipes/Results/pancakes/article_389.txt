2 teaspoons coconut oil, or as needed
4 eggs
1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter), melted
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup pure maple syrup
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup coconut flour, sifted
1/4 teaspoon baking soda, or more as needed
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup frozen blueberries, or more to taste
36 fresh blueberries, or more to taste


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease 36 miniature muffin cups with coconut oil.
Whisk eggs, ghee, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Stir coconut flour, baking soda, and sea salt into egg mixture just until batter is combined. Fold frozen blueberries into batter. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Press 1 fresh blueberry on top of each muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
