2 cups buttermilk pancake mix
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter


Place the pancake mix in a large bowl. Add the water and Amish Friendship Bread Starter and stir until well combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
