3 large potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/4 cup milk
3 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup finely chopped cooked ham
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup oil for frying


Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes, and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and shred.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix milk, butter and garlic. Bring to a gentle boil, then mix in potatoes, ham and Cheddar cheese. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches a dough-like consistency.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Drop potato mixture by rounded spoonfuls into the oil, and cook, turning once, until lightly browned on both sides.
