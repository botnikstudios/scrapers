1 cup white whole wheat flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup low-fat (1%) milk
1/2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup blueberries


Whisk together flour and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add milk and water, stirring to combine. Mix in salt and beat until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Tilt pan with a circular motion so batter coats the surface evenly.
Cook crepe until bottom is light brown, about 2 minutes. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook other side. Serve hot with yogurt, maple syrup, and blueberries.
