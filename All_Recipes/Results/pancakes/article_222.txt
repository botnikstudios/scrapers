2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 eggs
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat eggs in a separate bowl using an electric mixer for 1 minute; add beer, milk, oil, and vanilla extract and beat on low for 30 seconds. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture and mix just until combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Drop 1/2 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
