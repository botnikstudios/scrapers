2 eggs
1 1/4 cups milk
2 teaspoons cooking oil
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 (12 ounce) can corned beef, broken into pieces


Preheat waffle iron.
In a medium bowl, mix together the eggs, milk and oil. Combine the flour, salt and baking powder; stir into the milk mixture until it makes a smooth batter. Stir in corned beef.
Spoon batter onto your waffle iron, close the lid, and cook until the waffle iron stops steaming and waffles are golden. Serve hot with butter.
