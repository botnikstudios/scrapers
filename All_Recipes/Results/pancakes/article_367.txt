2 cups almond milk
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 lemon, juiced
3/4 cup rice flour
1/3 cup potato starch
1/4 cup arrowroot flour
3 tablespoons tapioca flour
2 tablespoons coconut sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
2 eggs


Whisk almond milk, vinegar, and lemon juice together in a bowl; set aside for 10 minutes.
Mix rice flour, potato starch, arrowroot flour, tapioca flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt together in a bowl. Stir coconut oil into flour mixture using a fork until evenly combined. Stir eggs into flour mixture.
Whisk milk mixture into flour mixture until batter is thoroughly mixed.
Heat a lightly oiled skillet or large pan over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet and immediately rotate the skillet until the batter evenly coats the bottom in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen; flip crepe and cook until the other side has turned light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
