2 eggs
2 cups plain kefir
1 cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
vegetable oil, or as needed


Whisk eggs together in a bowl until mixture is evenly yellow; add kefir, flour, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, and baking soda and mix until batter is smooth.
Coat a skillet with oil and place over high heat. Pour batter into the hot skillet, working in batches as needed, forming 3-inch pancakes; cook until batter starts bubbling and bottom is golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and continue frying until pancake is golden brown, about 1 minute.
