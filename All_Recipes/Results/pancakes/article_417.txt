1 cup self-rising cornmeal
1 egg
1 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed


Mix self-rising cornmeal, egg, and buttermilk together in a bowl to make a smooth batter.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the hot butter and cook pancake until browned and bubbles appear on the surface, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until set and other side is browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
