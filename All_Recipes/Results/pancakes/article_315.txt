1 egg
1/4 cup apple juice
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup amaranth flour
1/4 cup tapioca flour
3 tablespoons arrowroot flour
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon wheat-free baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt


In a medium mixing bowl, beat the egg with the apple juice and melted butter. Add the remaining ingredients and stir.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot. This batter must be used right away and can not sit and wait.
