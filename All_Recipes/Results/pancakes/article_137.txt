2 eggs
2 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 cup milk


Place the eggs, sugar, flour and milk into the container of a blender. Process until smooth on low speed.
Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Pour batter about 1/4 cup at a time (or more for larger pancakes). Tilt pan to achieve a round shape. Heat until golden, then flip and brown on the other side. Serve immediately with syrup, or fresh berries and whipped cream.
