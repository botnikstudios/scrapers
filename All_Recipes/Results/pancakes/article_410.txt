2 cups pancake mix
1 (12 ounce) can SPAMÂ® Classic, cut into small cubes
cooking spray
1/2 cup pancake syrup, or as needed


Prepare pancake mix according to package directions.
Fry SPAM(R) Classic in skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Pre-heat griddle or large skillet to medium and spray lightly with non-stick cooking spray.
Pour pancake batter onto griddle, using about 1/3 cup batter per pancake.
As the first side is cooking, top each pancake with some cubes of SPAM(R) Classic; cook pancakes until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 3 minutes. Flip pancakes over; cook on the other side until golden, about 2 minutes.
Repeat with remaining batter and SPAM(R) Classic. Serve topped with pancake syrup.
