1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
16 ounces applesauce
4 ounces raisins
2 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons blanched slivered almonds
1/4 cup butter


Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, prepare pancake batter by blending flour, 2 eggs, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 cup milk.
Heat a lightly greased griddle or medium skillet over medium heat. Pour approximately 1/8 of the batter onto the griddle. Flip with a metal spatula when bubbles begin to form, and cook until golden brown. Repeat with remaining batter, making 8 pancakes.
Place applesauce in a medium bowl, and mix in raisins. Spread the applesauce mixture over one side of each pancake. Roll pancakes jelly roll style, and cut in half vertically. Arrange pancake halves cut side down in a medium baking dish.
In a small bowl, mix remaining egg, salt and milk with sugar and almonds. Pour mixture over the pancakes.
Dot pancakes with butter, and bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven. Serve warm.
