1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1 1/2 cups milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 small banana, peeled and chopped


Combine flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt in a large bowl.  Mix in the peanut butter until the texture resembles cornmeal.  Add milk and vanilla; stir just until blended.  Stir in the banana pieces.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray.  Spoon batter onto the skillet, using approximately 2 tablespoons to form each silver dollar pancake.  Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.
