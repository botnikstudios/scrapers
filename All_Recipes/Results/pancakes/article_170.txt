3 eggs
1 1/4 cups milk
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed


Beat eggs in a bowl with an electric mixer until thick and lemon-colored, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in milk.
Sift flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Add to egg mixture; mix until batter is smooth.
Grease a griddle with butter; heat over medium heat. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter on the griddle; spread to make thin pancakes. Cook until light brown on bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is light brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
