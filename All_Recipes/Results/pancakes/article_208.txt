2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
3 tablespoons soy flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups soy milk


Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl combine dry ingredients.  In another large mixing bowl combine eggs, oil and almond extract; whisk until combined. Stir in soy milk.  Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until combined.  Batter should be slightly thick, adjust liquid if necessary.
Pour batter by the 1/4 cup full onto hot griddle.  Cook until edges look dry and bubbles burst. Flip and cook another minute or so until golden brown.  Serve warm.
