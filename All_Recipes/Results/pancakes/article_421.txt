3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter

Sift flour and powdered sugar into a mixing bowl.  Add eggs, milk, butter, vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth.
Heat a lightly greased 6 inch skillet. Add about 3 tablespoons batter. Tilt skillet so that batter spreads to almost cover the bottom of skillet.  Cook until lightly browned; turn and brown the other side.  Repeat process with remaining batter, grease skillet as needed.
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet.  Stir in brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg.  Stir in cream and cook until slightly thickened.  Add half the bananas at a time to skillet; cook for 2 to 3 minutes, spooning sauce over them.  Remove from heat.
Roll a crepe around each banana half and place on serving platter. Spoon sauce over crepes.  Top with whipped cream and a pinch of cinnamon.
