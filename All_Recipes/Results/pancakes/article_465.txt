3 cups peeled and mashed baked potatoes
1 cup chopped white onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground multi-colored peppercorns
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 eggs, whisked
2 cups extra-virgin olive oil, or as need for frying


Pour potatoes, onion, garlic, salt, ground peppercorns, flour, and eggs into a bowl, respectively. Fold mixture together with a rubber spatula until ingredients are well coated with egg and garlic, salt, and pepper are evenly mixed throughout. Break up any large potato chunks.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Form latke dough into baseball-size balls and flatten into 1-inch thick rounds.
Working in batches, place latkes in hot oil and cook until edges are a rich brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip latkes using a slotted spoon and cook until crisp and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to cool.
