1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/4 cup pureed extra-firm tofu
1 cup soy milk
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/2 cup water


Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and sea salt; set aside.
Whisk together the tofu, soy milk, canola oil, and water. Gradually whisk the flour mixture into the tofu mixture, making sure to beat out all lumps between additions.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until lightly browned on the bottom. Flip, and cook until lightly browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
