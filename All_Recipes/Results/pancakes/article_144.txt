1 cup cottage cheese
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 eggs, lightly beaten
cooking spray


Combine cottage cheese, flour, oil, and eggs in a large bowl.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.
