1 cup prepared mashed potatoes
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup milk
1 egg
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 teaspoons fine sea salt
1 1/2 cups shredded Yukon Gold potatoes
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 small zucchini, shredded
canola oil, or as needed, divided


Stir mashed potatoes, flour, milk, egg, butter, and sea salt together in a bowl. Add shredded potatoes, Cheddar cheese, and zucchini; stir until batter is well-combined.
Heat 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoons into hot oil. Cook, turning once, until golden-brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining oil and batter.
