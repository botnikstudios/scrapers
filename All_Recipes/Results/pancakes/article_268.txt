3 cups skim milk
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 cups rolled oats
3 large eggs
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, or more to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 pinch ground cloves, or more to taste
1 pinch salt


Stir milk and lemon juice together in a bowl; let sit until milk begins to slightly sour, about 10 minutes. Stir oats into milk mixture; cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Mix eggs, flour, baking powder, vanilla extract, cinnamon, cloves, and salt into oat mixture until batter is evenly combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
