2 apples - peeled, cored, and quartered
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/3 cup shortening
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Place apples in a blender. Add milk, flour, eggs, shortening, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until well mixed, scraping down sides of blender several times.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter.
