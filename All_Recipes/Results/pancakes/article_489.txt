1 1/2 cups frozen raspberries
1 cup frozen blueberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water


Combine the raspberries, blueberries, sugar, and water in a small saucepan; bring to a boil and cook at a boil for 5 minutes, scraping the bottom as needed to keep from burning. Reduce heat to low; simmer the mixture until thick, about 10 minutes. Serve warm.
