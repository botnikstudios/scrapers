1 cup dry pancake mix
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup pumpkin butter
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice


Mix pumpkin mix and cinnamon together in a bowl; add pumpkin butter, milk, egg, and lemon juice and stir until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
