2 1/4 pounds quark cheese
2/3 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup raisins, or to taste (optional)
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 pinches salt
1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed


Strain or process quark cheese through a sieve or meat grinder to achieve a powdery consistency. Mix quark cheese, 2/3 cup flour, sugar, raisins, eggs, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until batter is well mixed.
Pour 1/4 cup flour into a small bowl.
Roll batter, about 2 tablespoons per serving, into a ball and roll in flour until coated. Flatten each ball into a 2-inch patty, squaring off the edges.
Heat about 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Fry patties, working in batches, in the hot oil until dark brown and a shell has formed, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining oil and patties.
