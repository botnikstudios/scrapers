2 large eggs
2 tablespoons melted butter
1/2 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons King Arthur Coconut Flour
1/4 cup whey protein
1/4 cup King Arthur Almond Flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum


Whisk together the eggs, butter, applesauce, and vanilla extract until well blended.
In a separate bowl, mix together the remaining ingredients until thoroughly combined.
Whisk together the dry and wet ingredients until evenly moistened.
Heat a heavy frying pan over medium heat, or heat an electric griddle to 350 degrees F. Generously grease the frying pan or griddle.
Drop batter by the tablespoonful onto the greased pan or griddle.
Bake on one side until the edges begin to dry, a few bubbles form on the surface, and the pancakes hold together. Gently turn the pancakes and cook the other side until firm.
Repeat with the remaining batter.
Serve pancakes warm.
