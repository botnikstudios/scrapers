1 1/2 cups cottage cheese
1 cup eggs
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract


Blend cottage cheese, eggs, flour, coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a blender until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
