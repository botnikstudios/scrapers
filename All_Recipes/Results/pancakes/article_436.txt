2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 egg whites
cooking spray


Whisk flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until no lumps remain.
Pour milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract into the flour mixture; stir until just combined.
Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.
Fold the the beaten egg whites into the batter.
Preheat a waffle iron and coat with cooking spray.
Pour batter onto waffle iron in batches and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 2 minutes; repeat until all batter is used.
