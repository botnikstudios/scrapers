1 cup buttermilk
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup buckwheat flour
1/2 cup quinoa flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt


Combine buttermilk, egg, canola oil, and honey together in a large bowl. Mix buckwheat flour, quinoa flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl until blended. Incorporate flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture; stir until evenly mixed.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter, 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
