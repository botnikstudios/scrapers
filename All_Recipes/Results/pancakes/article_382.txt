2 cups diced tomatoes
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1 cup water
1/4 cup canola oil
5 potato, peeled and grated
salt and pepper to taste
1 dash hot pepper sauce, or to taste
1 small onion, minced
2 eggs
2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup canola oil


Place tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, and water into the bowl of a blender; blend until smooth. Heat 1/4 cup canola oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Carefully stir in tomato puree, and cook for 15 minutes until thickened.
While the sauce is cooking, season the shredded potato to taste with salt, pepper, and hot pepper sauce. Mix in onion, eggs, and jalapeno; sprinkle with flour and mix until thoroughly combined. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Drop potato mixture into hot oil by the heaping tablespoon. Flatten slightly, and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels, and continue with remaining potato mixture. Serve the potato pancakes with sauce spooned overtop.
