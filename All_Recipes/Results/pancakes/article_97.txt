1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 cups milk
1 egg, beaten
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup chocolate chips
1 ripe banana, diced


Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and brown sugar in bowl. Beat egg and milk together and stir in peanut butter until smooth in a second bowl. Whisk the milk mixture into the dry ingredients just until moistened, then whisk in melted butter and vanilla extract. Gently fold chocolate chips and diced banana into the batter.
Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and pour 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into the middle of the skillet. Let the pancake cook until bottom is golden brown and there are many small pinholes in the top of the pancake before flipping, about 2 minutes. Cook other side until golden brown and the middle of the pancake is set, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
