1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup water
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon caraway seeds


Heat a non-stick crepe pan over medium-high heat.
Whisk flour and water together in a bowl. Add egg and mix well. Whisk butter, salt, and caraway seeds into flour mixture to form a smooth batter.
Pour about 1/4 cup batter into heated pan. Tilt the pan around so the batter forms a nice round shape. Cook until bubbles form throughout the batter, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip the crepe by using spatula to loosen it from the pan. Flick your wrist upwards to give the crepe a toss, flipping it, and landing it back in the pan. Cook the second side until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining batter.
