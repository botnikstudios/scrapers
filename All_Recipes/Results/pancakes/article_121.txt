2 cups spelt flour
2 cups oat flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1/4 cup ground flaxseed meal
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups low-fat vanilla soy milk
1/4 cup applesauce
2 tablespoons agave nectar
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
2 cups blueberries


Whisk spelt flour, oat flour, baking powder, flaxseed meal, and salt together in a large mixing bowl.
Stir soy milk, applesauce, agave nectar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl.
Form a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour soy milk mixture into the well. Stir until the ingredients are just moistened; set aside for 15 minutes.
Lightly oil and heat a griddle to medium heat.
Spoon batter onto hot griddle, sprinkle blueberries onto wet batter, and cook until bubbles form, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes more.
