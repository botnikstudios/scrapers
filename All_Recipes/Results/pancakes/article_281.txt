1 cup rice flour
salt to taste
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
cooking spray


Mix rice flour and salt together in a bowl; form a well in the center of the mixture. Stir in egg, vegetable oil, and enough water to make a smooth batter.
Spray a non-stick frying pan with cooking spray and place over medium heat; pour about 1/4 cup batter into the hot pan. Tilt pan until batter covers the whole bottom surface making a thin pancake; cook for 1 minute. Flip and cook about 1 more minute. Repeat with remaining batter.
