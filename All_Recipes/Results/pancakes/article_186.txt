1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips


Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat egg into milk in a separate bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour melted butter into flour mixture; whisk in milk mixture to make a smooth batter. Fold chocolate chips into batter.
Heat a small nonstick skillet over low heat; pour about 1/3 cup of batter into hot skillet and cover with a lid. Cook pancake until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes; flip pancake and cook covered until other side is browned. Repeat with remaining batter.
