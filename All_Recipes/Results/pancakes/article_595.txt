4 large potatoes, grated
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil


In a medium bowl combine potatoes, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, paprika, flour and pepper.  Mix very well.
Coat a medium skillet with oil and heat on medium-high.  Using a fork or spoon quickly spread a thin layer of potato mixture over the entire bottom of the pan.  Make the pancake as thin as possible, without gaps or holes.  Fry for 2 minutes, or until golden brown.  Flip with a spatula and cook on the other side.
Repeat with remaining potato mixture.
