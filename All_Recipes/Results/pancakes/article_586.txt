1 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
2 cups milk


In a mixing bowl, combine flour, egg, and milk.
Heat a large skillet or crepe pan over a medium-high heat. Spray the pan with non-stick cooking spray. Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the pan, lift the pan and turn it by rotating your wrist, spreading a PAPER THIN amount in the pan.  Flip the crepe when it starts to bubble. When it is finished cooking, remove it and repeat this process with the remaining batter.
