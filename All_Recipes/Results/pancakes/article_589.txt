2 cups mashed potatoes
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 onion, diced
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed


Mix mashed potatoes, flour, onion, egg, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl until batter consistency.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop 4-inch circles of batter into hot oil. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining batter.
