CREPES
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup skim milk
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1 pinch salt
FILLING
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup sliced fresh strawberries
3/4 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed


In a large bowl, beat together egg, milk, water and oil.  Beat in flour, sugar and salt until smooth.
Heat a medium, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Place a ladleful of crepe batter into center of pan, tilting to coat the bottom.  Cook until golden brown on one side, turning once, 2 to 5 minutes.  Continue with remaining batter.
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.
To assemble, spread some melted chocolate on the lighter side of one crepe.  Place a line of overlapping strawberries down the center of the crepe and roll it up.  Top with whipped topping and drizzle with a bit more chocolate.  Repeat with remaining crepes.
