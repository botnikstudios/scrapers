3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 egg
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil


Mix together flour, sugar, baking powder and cheese. In a separate bowl, beat together egg, milk and oil. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until just combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
