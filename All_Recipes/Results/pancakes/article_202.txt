1 cup sorghum flour
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 egg white
1 tablespoon orange juice
2 teaspoons stevia sweetener (such as TruviaÂ®)
1 teaspoon orange zest
1/8 pinch ground nutmeg
1 cup frozen cranberries, thawed
cooking spray


Mix sorghum flour, almond milk, egg white, orange juice, stevia sweetener, orange zest, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Fold cranberries gently into the batter.
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium; pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles start to form and bottom is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining batter.
