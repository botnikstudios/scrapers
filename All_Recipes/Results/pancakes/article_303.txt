1 cup oats
1 cup cottage cheese
3/4 cup egg whites
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup skim milk
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
cooking spray


Blend oats, cottage cheese, egg whites, pumpkin puree, milk, pumpkin pie spice, honey, and cinnamon in blender until batter is smooth; pour into a bowl.
Heat a pan or skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray.
Scoop batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, into the hot pan; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
