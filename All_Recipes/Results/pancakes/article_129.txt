1 cup cooked rice
1 cup milk
1 1/4 cups rice flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons applesauce
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon vegetable oil


Combine the rice, milk, rice flour, sugar, applesauce, baking powder, and oil together in a bowl; blend with an electric hand mixer for 2 minutes.
Grease a large skillet or griddle and place over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter onto the griddle; cook until the underside is golden brown. Flip and cook until the other side is also golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
