2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups almond milk (such as Silk®)
1 (4 ounce) container applesauce
2 eggs
2 teaspoons almond extract
1/2 cup sliced almonds, or to taste
1 cup granola (such as Back to Nature®), or to taste


Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk almond milk, applesauce, eggs, and almond extract together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to almond milk mixture and stir until batter is just moistened. Stir granola and almonds into batter.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
