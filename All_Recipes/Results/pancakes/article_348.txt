3/4 teaspoon coconut flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup coconut milk
1/2 banana, mashed
3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
2 teaspoons bacon drippings, or to taste


Mix coconut flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Beat coconut milk, banana, and xanthan gum together in a separate bowl until smooth; add to flour mixture and stir until there are no clumps.
Brush half the bacon drippings onto the cooking surface of a large skillet placed over medium heat to preheat. Spread about half the batter onto the skillet using a silicone spatula to spread to about 1/4-inch thick. Cook until it bottom looks dry and dark brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook until the other side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Repeat with remaining bacon drippings and batter.
