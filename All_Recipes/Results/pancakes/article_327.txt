1 1/2 cups almond meal
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup applesauce
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup coconut milk, or more as needed
1 teaspoon olive oil, for frying
Topping
1 cup strawberries


Mix together almond flour, eggs, vanilla extract, cinnamon, applesauce, baking powder, and coconut milk in a bowl.
Lightly oil a griddle and place over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges of pancake are dry. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
Puree strawberries in a food processor until smooth. Top pancakes with pureed strawberries.
