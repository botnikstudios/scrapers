7 red potatoes, shredded, or more to taste
1/2 onion, shredded
2 eggs
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper


Stir potatoes, onion, eggs, flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.
Heat a lightly oiled large skillet over medium heat. Drop potato mixture by large spoonfuls onto the skillet and cook until edges are dry and golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining potato mixture.
