1 sweet potato, cubed
3 eggs
1/2 cup milk (optional)
1/2 cup oats, ground to flour
2 scoops vanilla protein powder (optional)
1/4 cup flax seeds
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice (such as Trader Joe'sÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 large banana, sliced
2 1/2 tablespoons almonds
2 1/2 tablespoons pecans
2 1/2 tablespoons walnuts
2 tablespoons coconut oil, or as needed


Fill a pot with water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in sweet potato and return to a boil. Cook until sweet potato is tender, 7 to 10 minutes; drain.
Mash sweet potato in a small bowl with a fork.
Mix 1 cup mashed sweet potato, eggs, milk, oat flour, protein powder, flax seeds, pumpkin pie spice, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir in banana, almonds, pecans, and walnuts until batter is combined.
Melt coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour enough batter into the skillet to create a 4- to 6-inch pancake. Cook, flipping once, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
