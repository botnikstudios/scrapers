1 teaspoon butter
1 large banana, broken into chunks
1 large egg


Heat a large skillet over medium heat; add butter.
Mash banana chunks in a bowl using a fork until it becomes a wet consistency. Add egg and whisk mixture until batter is smooth.
Drop batter into the hot butter to make 2 pancakes. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 2 minutes.
