1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (14 ounce) can corn
1 (6.5 ounce) package cornbread mix
1/2 cup milk
1 egg


Heat oil in a griddle or large skillet over medium heat.
Stir corn, cornbread mix, milk, and egg together in a bowl until batter is combined.
Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto preheated griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
