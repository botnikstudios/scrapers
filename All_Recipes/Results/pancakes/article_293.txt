1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
2 tablespoons orange juice
3/4 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons canola oil

Preheat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat.
In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In a small bowl, beat together egg, orange juice, buttermilk, and canola oil. Whisk into the flour mixture. Stir in pineapple.
Pour batter about 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared griddle. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, until bubbly. Flip, and continue cooking until lightly browned.
