2 cups white flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups buttermilk
3 eggs, separated


Sift the flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Add the buttermilk and egg yolks; stir until you have a batter.
In a separate large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold the egg whites into the prepared batter.
Place an aebleskiver pan over medium heat; prepare each cup with cooking spray. Pour the batter into each cup to about 2/3 full. Cook until golden brown on each side, using a toothpick to flip, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
