2 cups whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cups buttermilk
2 eggs
3 tablespoons vegetable oil


Whisk whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and vegetable oil in a separate bowl; pour buttermilk mixture into dry ingredients. Stir just until combined (batter may seem a bit thick).
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Pour 1/3 cup of batter onto hot skillet and use a spoon to spread the pancake a bit. Cook until browned and bubbles appear on top, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned and set in the middle, about 2 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
