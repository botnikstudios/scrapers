1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups kefir
2 eggs
4 ounces chocolate chips, or more to taste (optional)


Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add kefir and eggs; stir until batter is moist but still lumpy. Fold in chocolate chips.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
