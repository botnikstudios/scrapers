2 cups milk
3 eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 dash salt
1 dash ground nutmeg (optional)


Combine milk, eggs, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg in a blender; blend until batter is smooth.
Heat a seasoned griddle over medium-high heat. Ladle 1/4 to 1/2 cup of batter onto the griddle and spread thinly. Cook until top looks barely dry, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Slide a long, thin spatula under pancake to loosen edges; flip. Continue cooking until just browned on the second side, about 1 minute more.
Roll up pancakes and serve a few at a time.
