2 cups mashed potatoes
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon butter


In a medium bowl, mix together potatoes, beaten egg, salt, and cheese. Melt butter on a large griddle at medium heat. Drop potato mixture onto griddle 1/4 cup at a time. Flatten with a spatula to 1/2 inch thick. Fry approximately 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Serve hot.
