1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 ripe bananas
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries
1 (7 ounce) can whipped cream


Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
Mash bananas in a large bowl using a fork. Add milk, egg, oil, and vanilla extract; mix well.
Stir banana mixture and chocolate chips into the flour mixture until batter is blended but still slightly lumpy.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
Top pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream.
