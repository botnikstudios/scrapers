2 cups peeled and shredded potatoes
3 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon grated onion
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup oil for frying
1 tablespoon oil
2 pears, cored and cut into 1/2-inch slices
1/4 cup brown sugar, divided
8 ounces goat cheese, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds
1/4 cup sherry vinegar


Place shredded potatoes in cheesecloth and wring out any excess moisture.
Mix potatoes, eggs, flour, onion, and salt together in a bowl.
Heat 1/2 cup oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until oil shimmers. Working in batches, drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing each down to form a pancake. Cook latkes until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side; transfer to paper towels to drain.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pears in hot oil and sprinkle 2 tablespoons brown sugar over pears. Cook pears until browned and sugar is melted, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Place latkes on a serving platter. Top each latke with 1 round of goat cheese and a pear. Sprinkle brown sugar on the pears and drizzle sherry vinegar over the top.
