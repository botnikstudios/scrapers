3 1/3 cups peeled and grated zucchini (courgette)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
3 tablespoons superfine sugar, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter


Mix zucchini, flour, egg, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until batter is well-combined.
Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter into the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.
