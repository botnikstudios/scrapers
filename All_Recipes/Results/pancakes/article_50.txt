1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup Herman Sourdough Starter
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk


In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, salt, sugar and baking powder. Add the sourdough starter, oil, eggs and milk; beat well.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
