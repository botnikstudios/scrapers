3 tablespoons butter
2 (13 ounce) packages frozen cheese-filled blintzes
4 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon orange juice


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a 2-quart casserole, and place the frozen blintzes on top of the butter in a single layer. Mix the eggs, sour cream, sugar, salt, vanilla extract, and orange juice in a bowl until thoroughly combined, and pour the mixture over the blintzes.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is lightly browned, and a toothpick inserted into the center of the casserole comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
