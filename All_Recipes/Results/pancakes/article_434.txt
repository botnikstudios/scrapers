1/2 cup soy milk
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup melted soy margarine
1 tablespoon turbinado sugar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt


In a large mixing bowl, blend soy milk, water, 1/4 cup margarine, sugar, syrup, flour, and salt. Cover and chill the mixture for 2 hours.
Lightly grease a 5 to 6 inch skillet with some soy margarine. Heat the skillet until hot. Pour approximately 3 tablespoons batter into the skillet.  Swirl to make the batter cover the skillet's bottom.  Cook until golden, flip and cook on opposite side.
