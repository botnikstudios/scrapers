2 cups white whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
2 tablespoons ground flax meal
17 fluid ounces orange juice
1 teaspoon orange extract


Whisk flour, baking powder, and flax meal together in a bowl; stir orange juice and orange extract into flour mixture until batter is well-combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat, or an electric griddle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
