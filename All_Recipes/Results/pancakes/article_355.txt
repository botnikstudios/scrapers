1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
2 small ripe bananas, finely chopped


In a large bowl, mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, baking powder and sugar. Stir in buttermilk and bananas just until moistened.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
