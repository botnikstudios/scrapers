1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1 large egg
1 tablespoon vegetable oil


Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Set a wire rack on a baking sheet and place in the oven.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk buttermilk, egg, and oil together in a large bowl. Stir flour mixture into buttermilk mixture just until batter is combined.
