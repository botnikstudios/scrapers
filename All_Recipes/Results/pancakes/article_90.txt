3/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon poppy seeds
1 teaspoon lemon zest
cooking spray


Stir the milk, vinegar, and lemon juice together in a bowl; let stand 10 minutes to curdle. Whisk in egg, butter, and vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, poppy seeds, and lemon zest until well combined. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and whisk a few times until the batter is mostly free of lumps.
Heat a skillet over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup of  batter per pancake into the skillet  and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes over with a spatula and brown the other side, about 2 more minutes.
