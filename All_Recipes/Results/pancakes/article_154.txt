1 cup Simply Potatoes® Mashed Potatoes
1 cup all-purpose baking mix
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup milk

In 12-inch nonstick skillet cook bacon and onions until browned. Remove from skillet. Reserve 1 tablespoon bacon grease. Set aside bacon and onions.
Meanwhile, in large bowl stir together Simply Potatoes, baking mix, cheese, cooked bacon and onions. Stir in milk and egg just until moistened.
Heat bacon grease in skillet over medium heat. Spoon four generous 1/4 cups of potato mixture into skillet at a time. Flatten slightly into pancakes. Cook each pancake about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Use additional vegetable oil in skillet if needed.
