6 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter
2 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
3 tablespoons brown sugar


Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to blend eggs, milk and vanilla. Add flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon; mix just until blended. Set aside.
Melt butter in a 9x9 inch square pan. Arrange apple slices in the bottom of the pan, and pour the batter over them. Sprinkle brown sugar over the top.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until puffed and lightly browned.
