3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 egg


In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, baking powder, salt and pecans (if desired). In a separate bowl, stir together milk, butter and egg. Add to the flour mixture and stir well.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
