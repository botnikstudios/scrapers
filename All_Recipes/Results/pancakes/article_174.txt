1/2 cup garbanzo bean flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup water


Stir the garbanzo bean flour, oats, cornmeal, cinnamon, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Stir in the water until only small lumps remain.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat until a drop of water skitters across the surface. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until  the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.
