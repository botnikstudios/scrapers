4 egg whites
3 tablespoons almond milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
2 tablespoons coconut flour
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch sea salt


Beat egg whites, almond milk, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; add coconut flour, baking powder, and sea salt and continue to beat until no clumps remain. Let the mixture sit for 8 minutes.
Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour about 1/3 of the batter into the pan. Tilt the pan so the batter covers the bottom of the skillet to all sides. Cook until the edges begin to slightly lift and the bottom is slightly browned, about 2 minutes; flip and cook until the other side is browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
