3 medium potatoes, shredded
2 green onions, chopped
1/2 (12 ounce) can corned beef, broken into very small chunks
1 egg
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup vegetable oil


In a large bowl, mix the potatoes, green onions, corned beef, and egg. Season with salt and pepper. Form the mixture into golf ball sized balls.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the potato balls a few at a time into the skillet, flatten with a spatula, and fry 7 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
