8 slices bacon
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3 cups flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
2 1/2 cups buttermilk
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract


Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray. Arrange the bacon on the prepared baking sheet, and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is crispy and the brown sugar is caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Immediately remove the bacon to a cutting board; cut into small pieces and set aside.
Preheat a waffle iron; grease with cooking spray.
Whisk the flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat the eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla together in a separate bowl; fold the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Add the bacon and stir, being careful to not over mix.
Ladle the batter into the preheated waffle iron and cook until golden brown; serve hot.
