1 cup sifted self-rising flour
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil


Beat eggs, oil, and milk together, and add to flour.  Stir until combined.
Heat a greased griddle until drops of water sprinkled on it evaporate noisily.  Pour 1/8 to 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle.  Turn over with a metal spatula when bubbles begin to form on top.  Cook second side to a golden brown color.
