1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour


Whisk together the brown sugar, white sugar, baking powder, milk, egg, olive oil, and vanilla extract. Stir in the flour 1/2 cup at a time until the batter reaches the desired thickness. The batter should look like cake batter (not too thin, but not too thick).
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.
