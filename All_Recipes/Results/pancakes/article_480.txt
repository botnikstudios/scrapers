2 eggs, separated
1 3/4 cups whole spelt flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 3/4 cups soy milk
1 apple - cored, peeled, and shredded
1/2 cup vegetable oil


Preheat and grease a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy and stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.
Mix spelt flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk egg yolks, soy milk, apple, and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl; pour into flour mixture. Stir to combine. Fold egg whites into batter, leaving some clumps.
Pour about 1 cup batter into waffle iron; cook until golden brown and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
