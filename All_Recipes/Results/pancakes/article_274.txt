1 cup pumpkin pie filling
2 eggs
2 cups milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg


Whisk pumpkin pie filling and eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Add milk, flour, baking powder, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg; whisk until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
