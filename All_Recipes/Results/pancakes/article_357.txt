1 egg
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup whole spelt flour
3 tablespoons flax seed meal
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons white sugar (optional)
2 teaspoons canola oil, or as needed
1/2 cup fresh blueberries (optional)


Whisk egg and 2 tablespoons canola oil together in a bowl. Add buttermilk; whisk to combine. Mix flour, flax meal, baking powder, and sugar together in a separate bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture; stir to combine.
Heat about 2 teaspoons canola oil in a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup batter into heated oil. Sprinkle a few blueberries into the wet batter. Cook until pancakes are evenly browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter and blueberries.
