2 cups buttermilk pancake mix
1 1/2 cups orange juice
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1 large banana, sliced
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup flaked coconut


Whisk together the pancake mix and orange juice; the batter will be lumpy. Stir in the pineapple, banana, pecans, and coconut.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
