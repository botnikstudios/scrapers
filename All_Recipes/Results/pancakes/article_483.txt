2 cups grated zucchini
2 large eggs, slightly beaten
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch dried oregano
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed


Blot grated zucchini with paper towels to remove moisture. Stir zucchini, eggs, and onion in a large bowl. Mix flour, Parmesan cheese, baking powder, salt, and oregano in a separate bowl; stir mixture into zucchini until batter is just moistened.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drop rounded spoonfuls of zucchini batter into hot oil; pan fry until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain pancakes on a paper towel-lined plate.
