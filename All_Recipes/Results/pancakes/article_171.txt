5 tablespoons butter, divided
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup plain yogurt
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1/4 cup water, or as needed
1 cup fresh blueberries


Place 3 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat yogurt and eggs together in a bowl; add melted butter and almond extract and beat well. Fold flour mixture into yogurt mixture until batter is well combined. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until batter reaches a pourable consistency.
Melt remaining butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Pour 1/4 cup batter into skillet and place 6 to 10 blueberries onto the batter; cook until batter starts to bubble, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until bottom is lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining batter and blueberries.
