2 cups whole wheat flour
2 apples, peeled and cored
1 1/2 cups almond milk
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons baking powder
2 tablespoons cane sugar, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Blend flour, apples, almond milk, coconut oil, water, baking powder, cane sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a blender until smooth.
Heat a non-stick griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
