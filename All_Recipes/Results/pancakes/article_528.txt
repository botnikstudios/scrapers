Batter:

1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Blackberry Sauce:
2 cups fresh blackberries

Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Prepare the cooking surface with cooking spray.
Beat flour, milk, eggs, vegetable oil, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl using an electric mixer until batter is thoroughly mixed.
Pour about 1/4 cup batter per waffle into the preheated waffle iron and cook according to manufacturers' instructions.
