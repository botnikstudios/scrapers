4 eggs
2 cups milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed


Beat eggs in a large bowl; add milk, flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and vanilla extract and mix until batter is very thin.
Heat a griddle or a Swedish plett pan over medium heat; add about 1 teaspoon oil. Pour a small amount of batter onto the griddle and tip griddle to spread the batter into a thin layer; cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancake and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Roll pancake and place on a plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
