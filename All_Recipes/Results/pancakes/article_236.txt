1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk, well shaken
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk coconut milk, egg, butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into the flour mixture just until batter is combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
