1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
1/4 cup ranch dressing
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 cups all-purpose flour


Place a large skillet over medium-low heat.
Whisk together the sugar, eggs, barbeque sauce, ranch dressing, and vegetable oil in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the flour until a moist, slightly lumpy batter forms. If the mixture is too runny, add additional flour until you get the desired consistency.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Bubbles will start to form in the pancakes. Cook until the edges of the pancakes start to look dry, and a bubble popped near the edge holds its shape. Flip the pancakes over, and continue cooking until the other side is golden brown. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to the griddle if necessary. Stack the pancakes on a plate and keep warm until serving. For larger batches, keep pancakes warm in a single layer on a cooling rack positioned over a baking sheet in a 300 degrees F oven (150 degrees C).
