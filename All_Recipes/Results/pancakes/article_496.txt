2 cups ricotta cheese
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 crepes
1 tablespoon butter, divided


Process ricotta cheese and cream cheese in a food processor until smooth and creamy; add egg yolk, melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt and process until fluffy.
Divide cheese mixture between the crepes. Spread filling into a thin layer and roll crepes around the filling.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry 3 crepes in melted butter until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes per side; repeat with remaining butter and crepes.
