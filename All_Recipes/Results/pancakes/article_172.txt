1 tablespoon butter
2 large peaches, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 drop vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet in the preheating oven.
Combine peach slices, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; gently toss to coat the peaches well.
Beat eggs, milk, flour, vanilla extract, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl until batter well-combined but a little lumpy; pour into skillet. Top batter with the peach mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until set in the middle, about 20 minutes.
