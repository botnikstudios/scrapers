3 eggs
1 cup almond flour
1 cup tapioca flour
1/2 cup almond milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt


Beat eggs in a bowl until smooth. Mix almond flour, tapioca flour, almond milk, vanilla extract, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into eggs until batter is just combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat or heat an electric frying pan. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
