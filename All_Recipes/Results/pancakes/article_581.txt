2 1/4 pounds potatoes, scrubbed
3 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons milk


Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook the potatoes until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 15 minutes; drain and refrigerate potatoes overnight.
Peel and grate the potatoes into a large bowl.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat; add the grated potatoes; season with salt. Press the potatoes into a round loaf using a spatula. Sprinkle the milk over them. Cover the skillet with a lid. When you hear the potatoes begin to sizzle in about 5 to 10 minutes, reduce the heat to low. Cook until a brown crust has formed on the bottom, about 30 minutes. Cover the skillet with a large plate and flip the roesti onto the plate to serve.
