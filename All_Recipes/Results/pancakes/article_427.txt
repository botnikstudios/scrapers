1/4 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon margarine


In a medium bowl, mix together the oil, eggs and milk. Combine the flour and salt, and mix into the egg mixture.
Melt margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour the batter into the pan, and cook until it starts to brown on the bottom. Then, chop it up with a spatula, and continue cooking until it is no longer doughy.
