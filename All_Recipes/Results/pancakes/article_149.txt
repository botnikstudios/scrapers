2/3 cup instant mashed potato flakes
1/3 cup complete dry pancake mix
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup skim milk
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)


Stir together the potato flakes, pancake mix, onion, Cheddar cheese, milk, egg, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl until well combined.
Grease a griddle or large skillet, and place over medium heat. Drop pancakes, 1/4 cup at a time, onto the hot griddle, and cook until the edges look dry and 1 bubble appears in the center, about 3 minutes. Flip the pancakes, and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 more minutes.
