1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/3 cups dry milk powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups whole wheat flour
3/4 cup white sugar
4 eggs, lightly beaten
3 cups water
1/4 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons vinegar


In a large bowl, sift all-purpose flour, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir in whole wheat flour. In a small bowl, combine sugar, eggs, water, butter and vinegar. Make a well in the flour mixture, and pour in the egg mixture. Mix until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.
