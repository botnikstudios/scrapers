cooking spray
1 cup hulled fresh strawberries
1 cup gluten-free oats
1/2 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 egg whites, at room temperature
2 tablespoons dairy-free dark chocolate chips
1 tablespoon unsweetened vanilla-flavored almond milk
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 pinch sea salt


Combine strawberries, oats, Greek yogurt, applesauce, egg whites, chocolate chips, almond milk, baking powder, cinnamon, almond extract, and salt in a blender; blend until batter is smooth and slightly runny.
Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat; spray with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the hot skillet. Cook pancake until bubbles form, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a cooking rack. Repeat with remaining batter.
