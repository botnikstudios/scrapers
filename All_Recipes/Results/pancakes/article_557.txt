2 russet potatoes, cut into small pieces
1 leek, cut into small pieces
3 eggs
1/4 cup flaxseed meal
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine potatoes and leek in a food processor; process until mashed. Add eggs, flaxseed meal, and salt; pulse until incorporated.
Spoon potato mixture onto the lined baking sheet. Flatten gently into 3-inch circles. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until Parmesan cheese is melted and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
