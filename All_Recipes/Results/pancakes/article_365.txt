3 russet potatoes, peeled and shredded
1 Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored, and shredded
2 eggs
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 green onions, diced
salt to taste
vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
1/2 tablespoon sour cream (optional)


Place shredded potatoes and apple in a clean kitchen towel. Gather towel on top and wring out excess liquid.
Combine potatoes, apple, eggs, flour, and green onion in a bowl.
Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy sauce pan over medium-high heat.
Form mixture into palm-sized patties; fry in hot oil, working in batches, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes on each side. More oil may be needed with each batch.
Remove pancakes from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt.
Serve pancakes topped with sour cream.
