2 cups pancake mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
1/3 cup instant butterscotch pudding mix
1 cup milk
2 eggs


Mix pancake mix and pudding mix together in a bowl; add milk and eggs and stir until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
