1/2 cup wheat germ
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups buttermilk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon canola oil
cooking spray


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread wheat germ over a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until toasted, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly, then transfer wheat germ to a large bowl.
Stir flour, baking soda, and salt into wheat germ. Beat buttermilk, eggs, and oil in another bowl until smooth; pour egg mixture into flour mixture and stir until batter is just blended.
Heat griddle over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup portions of batter onto the griddle  and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
