2 cups potato, cubed
3 Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and shredded
1 onion, shredded
2 eggs
3 tablespoons matzo meal
1 teaspoon kosher salt
6 tablespoons vegetable oil


Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash.
In a medium bowl, mix shredded Yukon Gold potatoes, mashed potatoes and onion. Add in eggs, matzo meal and salt; mix well.
Feel consistency of the dough; mixture should hold together without being sticky. If it sticks to your hands, add more matzo meal until dough is no longer sticky.
In a large skillet over medium heat, warm enough oil or butter or margarine to cover 1/4 inch of the skillet.
When hot, drop mixture by heaping tablespoon to oil; flatten with a spatula and cook on both sides until golden brown. Serve.
