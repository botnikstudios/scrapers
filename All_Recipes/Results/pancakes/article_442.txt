cooking spray
1 3/4 cups almond milk
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons chia seeds
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup flax seed meal
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons white sugar, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)


Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions; spray the inside with cooking spray.
Whisk almond milk, applesauce, egg, chia seeds, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; let sit until chia seeds start to thicken the mixture, about 2 minutes. Whisk flour, oats, flax seed meal, baking powder, sugar, and salt into almond milk mixture until batter is smooth.
Scoop 1/2 cup batter into the preheated waffle iron and cook until crisp and golden, about 5 minutes per waffle. Repeat with remaining batter.
