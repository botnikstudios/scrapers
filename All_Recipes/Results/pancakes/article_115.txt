2/3 cup water
2/3 cup milk
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/3 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup all-purpose flour


Whisk water, milk, eggs, vegetable oil, and salt together in a bowl. Slowly whisk flour into wet ingredients until incorporated. Let batter rest for 1 hour; stir again.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 4 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
