1 1/2 cups quinoa flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 3/4 cups buttermilk
1 cup pumpkin puree
2 eggs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
cooking spray


Mix quinoa flour, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and ginger together in a large bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, pumpkin puree, eggs, and oil together in a separate bowl. Pour over quinoa flour mixture; stir just until batter is blended.
Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until the center springs back when pressed, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
