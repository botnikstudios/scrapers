1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 pinch fine salt
2 eggs, separated
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups whole milk
6 tablespoons melted butter


Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Stir egg yolks and vanilla extract into flour mixture. Mix milk, alternating with butter in 3 to 4 additions, into flour mixture until batter is smooth.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds. Gently fold egg whites into batter; let rest 10 to 15 minutes.
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Spoon batter into the waffle iron and cook according to manufacturer's instructions.
