3 eggs
3 cups buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/4 cups cooked wild rice


Whisk eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla in a large bowl. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt in a separate bowl. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture, mixing well to make a smooth batter. Stir in butter and cooked wild rice.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.
For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter on griddle and cook until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Continue with remaining batter.
