1/4 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons almond milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons coconut flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup almond meal
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, or to taste
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed


Mix pumpkin puree, almond milk, eggs, maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth.
Whisk coconut flour, baking soda, salt, almond meal, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves together in a separate bowl.
Stir pumpkin mixture and flour mixture together in a pourable container until well incorporated. Allow batter to sit for 3 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over low heat. Pour silver dollar-sized circles of batter into the hot oil. Cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side.
