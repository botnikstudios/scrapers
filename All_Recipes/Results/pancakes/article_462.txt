2 cups stone ground cornmeal
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup whole milk
2 tablespoons boiling water


Cream the cornmeal, salt, and butter together. Add the milk and enough water to make a moist but firm batter.
Drop by large spoonfuls onto a hot greased griddle, and flatten slightly with the back of a spoon. When brown, turn and cook the other side.
