1 1/8 cups butter
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon baking powder


Cream together the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the cream. Add the baking soda and little water (no more than 2 tablespoons) to the butter mixture.
Sift the spices, baking powder and flour into the butter mixture. Blend until a nice dough is formed. Roll dough into sausages about 2-1/2 inches in diameter wrap tightly and let dough chill thoroughly.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove chilled dough and cut into thin slices. Bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet  for 6 to 8 minutes. Let cookies cool on wire rack.
