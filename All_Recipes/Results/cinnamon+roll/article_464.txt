6 cups water
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick
1 whole clove
1/2 cup ground coffee beans
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup chocolate syrup
1 cup whipped cream


Bring the water, sugar, cinnamon, and clove to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, then remove from the heat, stir in the coffee grounds, cover, and steep for 5 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and chocolate syrup, then strain through several layers of cheesecloth to remove the coffee grounds and spices. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream.
