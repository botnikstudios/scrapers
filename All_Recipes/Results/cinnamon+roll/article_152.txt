1 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/8 cup shortening
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 quart oil for frying
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
6 tablespoons white sugar


In small saucepan over medium heat, combine milk, salt, 2 tablespoons sugar and shortening.  Heat until shortening melts and sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat and let cool to lukewarm, 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).  Sprinkle in yeast and let sit until foamy.
Transfer mixture to large bowl, and stir in flour to make a dough.  Knead until smooth, cover and let rise 30 minutes.
In a large heavy skillet or deep fryer, heat 1 inch of oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll out 1 to 2 inch balls of dough into thin sheets.  Fry sheets 1 to 2 minutes on a side, until puffed and golden.  Drain on paper towels.
Combine cinnamon and 6 tablespoons sugar.  Sprinkle over warm pastries.  Serve.
