1 cup water
1/4 cup apple juice
1 apple, cored and chopped
2/3 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup milk


Combine the water, apple juice, and apples in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, and stir in the rolled oats and cinnamon. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until thick, about 3 minutes. Spoon into serving bowls, and pour milk over the servings.
