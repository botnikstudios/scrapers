1 cup chopped almonds
1 1/3 cups cream cheese
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 pinch salt
5/8 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup baking powder
7/8 cup plum butter
1 3/4 pounds plums, pitted and diced
2 tablespoons butter, melted


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan.
Place a skillet over medium-high heat. Toast the almonds in the hot skillet until they turn brown; set aside to cool.
Combine the cream cheese, milk, oil, salt, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix in the flour and baking powder; knead together until smooth. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, and roll the dough into a 20-inch square. Spread the plum butter, plums, and toasted almonds over the dough. Roll the dough up tightly like a jelly roll. Cut into 12 even slices. Arrange rolls in prepared pan. Brush butter over top of the rolls.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 55 minutes.
