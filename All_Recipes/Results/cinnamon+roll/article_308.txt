2 cups milk
2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast
1 quart water, divided
2/3 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons anise seeds
8 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed


Pour the milk into a pan, and heat just until bubbles form around the edge of the pan. Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm (110 degrees F/45 degrees C).
Dissolve yeast in 1 cup lukewarm (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) water. Allow to rest 5 minutes.
Beat the shortening with the sugar, eggs, salt, and anise seeds in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the milk and yeast mixture. Gradually mix in the flour, stirring to make a soft dough (dough should not be sticky). Add more flour if needed. Cover bowl with a clean cloth, and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Punch down dough, divide into two pieces, and roll out each piece into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut dough into 8x1 inch strips. Twist each strip into a simple knot, and place on prepared baking sheet. Cover with a clean cloth, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour 1 quart water into a pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Dip each roll quickly into the boiling water, and return to baking sheet.
Bake rolls in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
