1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 cups pecan halves (optional)
4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup warm milk
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup butter, melted
2 teaspoons salt
2 eggs
8 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 cup butter, melted, divided
1/3 cup white sugar
4 cups confectioners' sugar
2/3 cup butter, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon maple-flavored extract (optional)


Mix 1 1/2 cup white sugar, cinnamon, and pecans together in a bowl; set aside to be used as filling later.
Whisk yeast and warm water together in a separate bowl; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon white sugar. Continue whisking until well incorporated. Set aside until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 10 to 20 minutes.
Place warm milk, 2/3 cup white sugar, 2/3 cup melted butter, salt, eggs, and yeast mixture in a stand mixer; mix until all ingredients are incorporated. Add 4 cups flour; mix on medium until completely smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to a large bowl; knead the remaining 4 cups flour into dough with hands until dough is slightly stiff and sticky, 10 minutes.
Transfer dough to a large greased bowl; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
Remove plastic wrap from bowl and punch down dough. Set dough aside to rest for 5 minutes.
Roll dough out onto a well-floured surface, forming a 15x20-inch rectangle. Brush entire rectangle of dough with 1/2 cup melted butter; sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar filling. Tightly roll up dough, starting from a long end and pinch edges together to seal. Cut dough, using dental floss, into 15 to 20 slices.
Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish with 1/2 cup melted butter; sprinkle with 1/3 cup white sugar.
Arrange cinnamon rolls close together in the prepared casserole dish. Allow to rise in a warm place for 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
Beat confectioners' sugar, 2/3 cup melted butter, vanilla extract, and maple extract together in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle over warm cinnamon rolls.
