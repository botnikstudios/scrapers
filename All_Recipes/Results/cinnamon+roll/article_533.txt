1 cup dry white wine
1 cup peach schnapps
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint leaves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups half-and-half cream
10 fresh peaches, sliced


Place white wine, peach schnapps, sugar, mint leaves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and half-and-half together in a bowl, and stir until well blended and sugar is dissolved. Add sliced peaches, and transfer to a saucepan.
Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring frequently and reducing heat if necessary to prevent scorching cream. Remove from heat when peaches are tender. Cool to a safe temperature for blending. Process in a blender or food processor until completely smooth. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve chilled.
