2 cups water
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
7 1/2 cups self-rising flour


In a large bowl place 2 cups water and butter or margarine. Microwave about 2 minutes.
In another bowl, mix 1 cup sugar and eggs.
In a separate cup, microwave 1/2 cup water for 30 seconds. Add 1 teaspoon sugar and dissolve yeast in this.
Mix butter water and sugar and eggs mixture together; add salt. Mix in yeast water. Stir in 7 to 7 1/2 cups flour. Mix well and let rise in the refrigerator overnight, covered.
When ready to use, dump onto floured surface (DO NOT PUNCH DOWN!) and let warm to room temperature. LIGHTLY KNEAD! Only work in enough extra flour to handle.
Shape into rolls and place on greased sheet(s). Let rest 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Bake in a preheated 400 degree F (205 degrees C) oven until tops are golden. Brush with oil or butter immediately out of the oven.
