1 (12.4 ounce) package refrigerated cinnamon roll dough with icing
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup margarine, softened
8 Granny Smith apples, peeled and sliced, or more to taste
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll cinnamon rolls onto a work surface to desired thickness; press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix oats, brown sugar, flour, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and salt on a bowl; add margarine and mix until crumbly.
Spread apples over cinnamon roll crust. Mix white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl and sprinkle over apples; top with oat mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender, 40 to 50 minutes.
Place icing in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until warmed, 20 to 30 seconds. Pour icing over crisp.
