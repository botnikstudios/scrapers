cooking spray
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar, divided
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons milk
1/4 cup butter, melted, divided
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 4 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Mix flour, 1 tablespoon white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk milk, 2 tablespoons butter, and apple cider vinegar together in a small bowl. Pour over the flour mixture; mix until a soft dough forms.
Dust a flat work surface with flour. Roll dough out to a 6x7-inch rectangle. Spread remaining 2 tablespoons butter on top.
Mix remaining 1 tablespoon white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the buttered dough.
Roll dough lengthwise into a log. Cut into 4 pieces using a sharp serrated knife. Place 1 piece in each muffin cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on all sides, 13 to 15 minutes.
