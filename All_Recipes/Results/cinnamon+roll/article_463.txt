2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup milk
1 3/4 cups packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups water
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup apple - peeled, cored, and chopped


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9 inch square baking dish.
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk. Mix well and pour into prepared pan.
In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, water and butter. Bring to a boil and pour over batter in the pan. Sprinkle top with nuts and chopped apples.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Serve warm.
