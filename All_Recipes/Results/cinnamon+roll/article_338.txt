Spring Rolls:
2 carrots, julienned
1 red bell pepper, julienned
1 English cucumber, peeled and julienned
1 cup shredded red cabbage
4 scallions, white parts thinly sliced lengthwise
2 avocados, halved and sliced
16 basil leaves
16 mint leaves
4 ounces dry rice noodles
16 sheets rice paper
Peanut Sauce:
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup SilkÂ® Unsweetened Coconutmilk
2 tablespoons soy or tamari sauce
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
2 teaspoons hot sauce (such as Sriracha), or more to taste


Chop all vegetables to 2-inch length and cook rice noodles according to instructions on pack.
Working one at a time, soak a sheet of rice paper in a shallow dish of warm water until soft, about 10 seconds.
Lay softened sheet gently on a flat surface, then mound vegetables, noodles and avocado or tofu in the center of sheet.
Gently fold bottom and top of rice paper to cover filling and then roll up like a burrito. Repeat with remaining rice paper and fillings.
To serve, mix peanut sauce ingredients in a small bowl and serve with spring rolls.
