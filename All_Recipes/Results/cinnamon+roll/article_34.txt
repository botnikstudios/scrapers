1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands!Â®)
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 pinch brown sugar, or more to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste
Icing:
1 tablespoon skim milk
1 teaspoon maple syrup
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, or to taste


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 16 mini muffin cups.
Unroll biscuit dough on a work surface; cut into 2 halves along perforation. Brush each half with melted butter; sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Loosely re-roll to form a log and slice each half into 8 sections. Place into prepared muffin cups.
Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 8 minutes.
Whisk milk and maple syrup together in a bowl. Mix in confectioners' sugar, a few spoonfuls at a time, to form desired icing consistency. Drizzle over warm rolls.
