2 cups milk
4 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
4 carrots, grated
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened


Heat milk in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until warmed, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup flour and yeast to warm milk. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
Stir carrots, honey, and salt into yeast mixture. Mix flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, into carrot mixture, mixing thoroughly after each addition until a smooth dough forms. Mix butter into dough until thoroughly integrated using your hands. Cover bowl with a damp, clean towel.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place bowl with dough on top of oven while it preheats until dough has doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Form dough into rolls and arrange on a baking sheet; loosely cover dough with a clean towel or plastic wrap and let rise, 20 to 30 minutes.
Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
