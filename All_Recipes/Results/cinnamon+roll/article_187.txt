1 (6 ounce) package white chocolate, chopped
3 peppermint candy canes


Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Place white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave until melted, 60 to 90 seconds. Stir until smooth.
Place one gallon-sized resealable bag inside a second gallon-sized bag, creating a double-layered bag. Place candy canes inside the inner bag and seal. Crush the candy canes inside bag with a rolling pin. Stir crushed candy canes into melted white chocolate.
Pour white chocolate mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Chill in refrigerator until hardened, 1 hour.
