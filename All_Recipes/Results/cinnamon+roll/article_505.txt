1 cup finely shredded cabbage
1 (6.5 ounce) can shrimp, rinsed and drained
1/3 cup sweet and sour sauce
1/3 cup minced celery
1/4 cup shredded carrots
20 rice wrappers (6.5 inch diameter)


In a medium bowl, mix the cabbage, shrimp, sweet and sour sauce, celery and carrots.
Fill a small bowl with hot water. Dip rice wrappers one at a time into the water. Allow wrappers to soften, then remove from the water and drain. As wrappers are removed from the water, fill each with 2 tablespoons of the cabbage mixture. Roll the wrappers and chill covered until serving.
