3 (16 ounce) cans pear halves in juice
1 (2.25 ounce) package cinnamon red hot candies
1/4 teaspoon red food coloring
6 leaves butterhead lettuce


Drain the liquid from the cans of pears into a saucepan. Add red hot candies to the juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the candy has dissolved. Stir in the food coloring, remove from heat, and allow to cool.
Place the pear halves in a deep bowl. Pour the liquid over the pears, cover, and refrigerate overnight. You may want to stir a couple of times to evenly distribute the color. Serve pear halves cold on top of a leaf of lettuce.
