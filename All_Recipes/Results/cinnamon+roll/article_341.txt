Rolls:
4 cups boiling water
2 cups rolled oats
1 1/3 cups brown sugar
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2/3 cup lukewarm water
4 teaspoons salt
8 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
Honey Butter:
1 cup butter, softened
3 tablespoons honey
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Stir boiling water and oats together in a bowl; set aside to thicken and cool, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir brown sugar and vegetable oil into oat mixture.
Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Stir yeast mixture and salt into oat mixture. Beat flour, 1 cup at a time, into oat mixture until dough is soft. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes.
Place dough in an oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel; let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down and form into rolls; arrange on baking sheets. Let rise again until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
Beat butter, honey, and cinnamon together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth. Serve honey butter with rolls.
