1 1/4 cups margarine
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

3 cups rolled oats
2 ripe bananas, sliced
1 1/2 cups raisins
1 cup flaked coconut


Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar and white sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Stir in the oats, bananas, raisins and coconut, one at a time using a wooden spoon. Drop by rounded spoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet.
