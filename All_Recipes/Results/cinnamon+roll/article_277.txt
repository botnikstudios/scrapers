1 1/2 pounds Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup sugar
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
3/4 cup melted butter
1 egg


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toss apples with 1 tablespoon of sugar, and pour them into a pie plate.  Thoroughly mix together 1 cup of sugar with the flour, cinnamon, butter, and egg.  Spread this evenly over the top of the pie.
Bake in preheated oven until the apples have cooked and the topping is golden brown, about 40 to 45 minutes.
