8 ounces butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 egg
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground cloves
1/4 cup orange juice
2 teaspoons orange zest


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Stir in egg, corn syrup, orange juice, and orange zest.  Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and  cloves; stir into the creamed mixture until combined.
Roll dough out to 1/8 inch thickness, and cut into shapes with cookie cutters. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool cookies on wire racks.
