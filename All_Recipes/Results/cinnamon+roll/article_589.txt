2 ripe bananas, peeled
1 Hachiya persimmon, peeled
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon


Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 6 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mash bananas and persimmon together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 3/4 cup sugar, coconut oil, egg, and vanilla extract, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture using a spoon just until batter is combined. Fill each muffin cup 3/4-full with batter.
Mix 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 23 minutes.
