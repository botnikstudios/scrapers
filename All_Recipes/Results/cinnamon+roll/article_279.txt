4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 cups warm water
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup shortening
6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg


In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water and set aside to proof.
In another bowl, mix together sugar, salt, shortening, and  egg with an electric mixer at low speed.  Add mixture to yeast, and stir in flour. The last 3 cups of flour will have to be mixed in by hand.
Cover dough with a damp cloth, and place in refrigerator.  Punch down occasionally as dough rises.  You can leave dough in refrigerator overnight.
Two hours before baking, shape the dough into rolls.  Place on greased pans, baking trays or muffin pans.  Let rise 2 hours.
Bake at 400 degrees F ( 205 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes.
