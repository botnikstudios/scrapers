1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup quick cooking oats
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 cups applesauce
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup black raisins


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 8x4 inch loaf pan.
Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cloves together in a large bowl. Stir in the oats. Beat the butter, sugar, and vanilla together in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs until well blended. Mix in the applesauce, walnuts, and raisins. Stir in the flour mixture just until moistened. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted in middle comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Take care not to overbake. Cool 5 minutes in pan before turning out on a rack to cool completely.
