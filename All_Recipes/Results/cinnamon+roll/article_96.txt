3 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough
2 cups white sugar
4 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup melted butter
1/2 cup chopped pecans


Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8 inch cake pan.
In a small bowl combine sugar, cinnamon and a dash of salt. Open the biscuits and cut each biscuit into four pieces; set aside.
Put the pieces of biscuit into the mixture, a few at a time, until they are all completely coated. Arrange the biscuit pieces in the pan in layers.
Heat the butter in a small saucepan over low heat, stir the remaining sugar mixture and the pecans into the hot butter. Pour the butter mixture over the biscuit pieces.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, until top is golden brown.
