Brush with melted margarine and cut with biscuit cutter . Fold each roll in half and dip in melted margarine, place on greased cookie sheets.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Bake in a preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown. When using frozen rolls, remove from freezer at least 4 hours before serving.  When using refrigerated rolls, allow 3 hours for rolls to rise.
