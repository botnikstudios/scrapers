2 slices white bread, crusts removed
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1/8 teaspoon water, or as needed


Roll the bread slices until very flat. Butter the bread, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Starting on one side, roll up the bread slice until tight. Repeat with the second bread slice. Cut the bread rolls into 1 inch slices.
Mix the confectioners' sugar with the water in a small bowl to make a thin frosting. Drizzle frosting over the bread slices, and serve.
