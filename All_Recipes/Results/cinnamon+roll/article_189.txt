2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
3 1/4 cups bread flour
3/4 teaspoon bread improver
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons margarine
2 eggs
1 cup canned evaporated milk
1 cup canned evaporated milk
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs


Place the yeast, bread flour, bread improver, sugar, salt, margarine, eggs, and 1 cup of evaporated milk into a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Dough cycle, and press start.
When the cycle has ended, remove the dough from the machine, and form into 2 inch balls. Dip each ball in the remaining evaporated milk, then in the dry bread crumbs. Place the rolls on a baking sheet crumb-side up. Cover loosely with a cloth or plastic, and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake rolls for 8 minutes, or until golden brown on the top and bottom.
