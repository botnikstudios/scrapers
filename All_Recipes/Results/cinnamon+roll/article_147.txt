1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons ketchup
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved
4 long metal skewers


Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, ketchup, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 to 8 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick "log" shape.
Place kebabs on grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side 3 or 4 minutes; turn. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
