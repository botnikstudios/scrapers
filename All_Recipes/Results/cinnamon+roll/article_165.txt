2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
2/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup finely minced candied ginger
1/4 cup molasses
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg, beaten
1/2 cup white sugar, or as needed for rolling cookies


Whisk 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cloves, black pepper, and cayenne together in a large mixing bowl until thoroughly mixed.
Cream together butter and 2/3 cup sugar in a separate bowl until pale yellow and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add candied ginger, molasses, vanilla, and egg. Whisk mixture until well blended. Add dry ingredients to butter/sugar mixture and stir just until the flour disappears. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour 1/2 cup white sugar in a shallow dish for rolling cookies.
Scoop out about 1 1/2 teaspoons dough with a small scoop or teaspoon. Form dough into balls and roll in white sugar. Place cookies on prepared baking sheet. Slightly flatten cookies to about 1/4 inch thick; sprinkle with a pinch more sugar.
Bake in preheated oven until cookies are your desired crispiness or chewiness, 10 to 15 minutes.
