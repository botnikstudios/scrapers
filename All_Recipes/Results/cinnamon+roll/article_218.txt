1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
8 ounces fresh ricotta cheese, well drained
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons pumpkin puree
1/4 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Canola oil, for frying


Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.
Whisk ricotta, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate mixing bowl until smooth. Pour mixture into dry ingredients. Mix together until mixture becomes a loose batter.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Use one spoon to scoop out a heaping tablespoon of dough and a second spoon to carefully push dough into hot oil. Fry in batches for about 1 minute. If zeppole don't turn over by themselves after 1 minute, gently turn each with a strainer to brown on the other side, about 1 more minute. Remove with a strainer and drain on cooling rack.
