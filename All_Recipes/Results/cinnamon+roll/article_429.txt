1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
2 cups chopped, peeled apple
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a small baking dish, combine butter, sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, and milk until smooth.
