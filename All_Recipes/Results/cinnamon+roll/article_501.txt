2 (750 milliliter) bottles fruity red wine, such as Beaujolais
1 (750 milliliter) bottle port wine
3 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks
14 whole cloves
1 orange, peel cut into thin strips
1 cup white sugar, or to taste
3/4 cup rum, or to taste
1/4 cup brandy, or to taste
1 cup raisins
1 cup slivered almonds


Gently simmer the red wine, port wine, cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and orange peel in a large pot set over medium-low heat. Stir in the sugar, rum, and brandy. Continue simmering 5 minutes more, stirring to completely dissolve the sugar, and the mixture is steaming but not boiling.
Mix the raisins and almonds together in a bowl.
To serve, ladle into coffee cups or Swedish-style small glass or ceramic mugs. Garnish each cup with a spoonful of the raisin and almond mixture.
