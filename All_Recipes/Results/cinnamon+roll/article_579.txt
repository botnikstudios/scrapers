1 cup shortening
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup sour cream
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups chopped black walnuts
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and shortening. Add the eggs and vanilla; mix well. Stir in the sour cream. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the chopped black walnuts.
Drop cookies by teaspoonful onto a cookie sheet. In a small saucer, stir together the cinnamon and 3 tablespoons of sugar. Grease the bottom of a drinking glass and dip it into the cinnamon sugar mixture. Press down on each cookie to flatten slightly. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes.  These cookies travel and freeze well.
