24 frozen dinner roll dough, thawed, divided
1/2 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1 (4.6 ounce) package cook-and-serve vanilla pudding mix
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Arrange 12 dinner rolls in the prepared baking dish.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add brown sugar, pudding mix, milk, and cinnamon to melted butter; stir until smooth. Pour pudding mixture over rolls; top with remaining 12 rolls. Allow rolls to rise for 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
