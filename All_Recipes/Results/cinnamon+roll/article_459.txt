6 1/4 cups cubed whole wheat bread
1 1/4 cups milk
1 egg, beaten
1/3 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup raisins
1/4 cup dried mixed fruit
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon


Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine bread and milk, and set aside to soak for 5 minutes. Then stir in egg, butter, raisins, mixed fruit, brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix well. Press the mixture into a  9-inch square baking pan.
Bake in preheated oven until golden and firm to touch, about 35 minutes. Leave in baking pan to cool, then cut into squares.
