1 tablespoon dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup warm water
1/4 cup olive oil
3 cups hard white whole wheat flour, or more as needed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt


Stir yeast and sugar into warm water in a large bowl; set aside until liquid starts to bubble and foam, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix in oil. Add flour and salt, stirring until dough is smooth; stir in more flour as needed.
Knead dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes and place in a large bowl; cover bowl with a damp towel. Allow dough to rise for 20 to 30 minutes. Place dough on a pizza stone and roll out with a rolling pin.
