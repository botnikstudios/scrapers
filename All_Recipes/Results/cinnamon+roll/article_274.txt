3 tablespoons potato flakes
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup boiling water
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)


Pour the boiling water over the instant mashed potatoes and set aside. Scald the milk with the oil and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Add The 1/2 cup very warm water and the teaspoon sugar to the yeast and set aside.
Add the potatoes to the milk mixture. Start adding the flour, then eggs, one at a time, beating with a mixer or dough hooks. Add yeast mixture and all but  1 cup of the remaining flour and salt.
Use the reserved 1 cup of flour for kneading. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes on a floured board. Place the dough in a large greased bowl, being sure to grease top of dough also. Cover dough with plastic wrap then with a double piece of foil. Refrigerate or let rise once and make into rolls. If made at night knead down dough before going to bed.
Once dough has risen once, punch down and shape into about 3 1/2 dozen rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased baking dish and bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for about 15 to 20 minutes.
