8 pounds peaches
1 cup sugar
4 cups water
2 cups honey
1 1/2 teaspoons whole allspice
3/4 teaspoon whole cloves
3 sticks cinnamon
3 Ball® or Kerr® Quart (32 oz) Jars with lids and bands


Prepare boiling water canner. Heat jars and lids in simmering water until ready to use. Do not boil. Set bands aside.
Wash, peel and pit peaches. Leave peaches in halves or cut into slices, if desired. Treat fruit to prevent browning.
Combine sugar, water and honey. Cook until sugar dissolves. Add peaches in syrup one layer at a time and cook for 3 minutes.
Pack hot peaches into hot jars leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Add 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1 stick cinnamon to each jar.
Ladle hot syrup over peaches leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Remove air bubbles. Wipe rim. Center hot lid on jar. Apply band and adjust until fit is fingertip tight.
Process filled jars in a boiling water canner for 25 minutes, adjusting for altitude. Remove jars and cool. Check lids for seal after 24 hours. Lid should not flex up and down when center is pressed.
