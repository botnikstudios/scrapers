4 eggs
2 tablespoons water
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder


Beat the eggs and water together in a bowl. Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a separate large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the beaten eggs into the well, then stir in the flour mixture until a soft dough forms.
Roll the dough into a very thin layer on a lightly-floured surface; cut into 1/2 inch strips. Allow to dry at least 4 hours before using.
