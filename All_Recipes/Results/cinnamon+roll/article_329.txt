3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 banana
1 tablespoon lemon juice

In a long-handled pan, heat rum and banana liqueur over medium heat until just warm.  Ignite the alcohol and pour carefully over the banana slices.  Remove the banana pan from the heat and continue to baste the banana slices with their sauce until the flames die down.  Serve at once.
