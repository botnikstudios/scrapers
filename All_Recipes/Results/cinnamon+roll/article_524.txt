Batter:
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 pinch salt
1 egg
1 cup milk
1/3 cup beer (such as HeinekenÂ®)
1 3/4 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup melted butter
1 teaspoon browning sauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 cup raisins
Glaze:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup water


Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 8x4-inch loaf pans.
Whisk the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Beat the egg in a mixing bowl; whisk in the milk, beer, and 1 3/4 cups of brown sugar until the brown sugar has dissolved. Stir in the butter, browning sauce, vanilla extract, and lime juice until blended. Add the flour mixture and raisins. Stir until no dry lumps remain. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
When the bread is nearly finished, combine 1/2 cup brown sugar and the water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until the sugar is thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Pour the glaze over the bread once it's done; return the bread to the oven and bake 5 minutes longer. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
