FOR THE CRUMBLE TOPPING
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, cubed
FOR THE PIE
1 (9 inch) single pie crust
6 apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup caramel sauce


Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
To make the topping, combine the oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, slivered almonds, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs; set aside.
Roll out the pie dough into a circle and transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the pastry and crimp the edge. Toss the apples with the lemon juice in a bowl to prevent browning. Combine the 1 tablespoon flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon; toss with the apples to coat. Drizzle 1/4 cup of caramel sauce over the bottom of the pie shell. Add the spiced apple mixture; drizzle with remaining 1/4 cup of caramel sauce. Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the apples.
Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the crust is browned.
