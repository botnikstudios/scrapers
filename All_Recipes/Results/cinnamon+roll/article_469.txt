1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup light molasses
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/3 cup granulated sugar for decoration
3/4 cup shortening


Cream together shortening and sugar.  Mix in molasses and egg.  Stir in sifted flour, salt, soda, cinnamon, clove, and ginger.  Dough will be soft and a little sticky.
Mold into walnut-sized balls, and roll in sugar.  Place on greased cookie sheets.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 7 to 8 minutes.  Baking them longer will make them less soft, but still chewy.
