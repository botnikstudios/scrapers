1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 cup warm water
1/2 teaspoon sage
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided


In a large mixing bowl dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sage, tarragon, nutmeg, sugar, salt, egg, butter or margarine and 1 cup of the flour. Using a wire whisk, beat until smooth. Stir in remaining 1 1/4 cups flour with a wooden spoon and beat until smooth. Scrape batter from sides of the bowl, cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes or until doubled in volume.
Deflate batter by Stirring with a wooden spoon. Lightly grease one 8 cup muffin pan. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin pan. Fill each cup slightly more than 1/2 full; set aside in a warm place and let rise for about 15 to 20 minutes or until doubled.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.
