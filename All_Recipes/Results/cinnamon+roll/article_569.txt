2 chicken thighs
2 chicken drumsticks
2 chicken breast halves
6 cups water
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon salt
2 bay leaves
2 cinnamon sticks
2 cups basmati rice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
6 whole cardamom pods
10 whole cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon baharat (Arabic 7-spice mix)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 cups chopped onions
1 1/2 cups very ripe tomatoes, chopped
3 tablespoons butter


Place chicken thighs, drumsticks, and breasts into a large pan and pour in 6 cups water; stir in 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup chopped onion, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until chicken is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove chicken, strain the broth, and retain 4 cups of broth.
While chicken is simmering, rinse basmati rice thoroughly until water runs clear. Place into a bowl and mix in 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, cardamom pods, whole cloves, nutmeg, baharat spice mix, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and black pepper. Let the rice sit while you complete remaining steps.
Soak golden raisins with 1/3 cup water in a small bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil with 1 tablespoon butter in a large pan. Cook and stir 2 cups onion with tomatoes until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. Mix in the seasoned rice and cook until rice grains are hot, 2 to 3 minutes; pour in reserved 4 cups of chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Mix in soaked golden raisins. Place 3 tablespoons butter into the pan, let melt, and turn heat to low; simmer  covered until rice is tender, about 45 minutes.
Tear chicken meat off the bones into bite-size pieces. Spread the rice onto a large serving platter and distribute cooked chicken over the rice to serve.
