1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon molasses
1 egg
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground cloves
2 teaspoons ground cardamom
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon orange zest


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar.  Beat in the molasses and egg. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and cardamom; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the orange juice. Then stir in the orange zest.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut out cookies with cookie cutters, and place them on an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, edges should be slightly browned. Cool cookies on wire racks.
