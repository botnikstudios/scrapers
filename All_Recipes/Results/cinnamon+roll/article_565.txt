1 cup cracked wheat
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces (optional)
1/2 cup pine nuts


Soak wheat in a bowl of warm water until water is slightly absorbed, about 25 minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess moisture.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x14-inch baking dish.
Mix soaked wheat, ground beef, onion, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Spread mixture in the prepared baking dish; top with butter and pine nuts.
Bake in the preheated oven until ground beef is no longer pink, about 25 minutes. Turn on oven's broiler; broil until top is browned, 5 minutes.
