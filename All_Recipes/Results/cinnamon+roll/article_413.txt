1/2 (6.75 ounce) package dried rice noodles
8 rice wrappers (8.5 inch diameter)
8 fresh mint leaves
8 cooked medium shrimp, sliced in half lengthwise
1 1/2 cups bean sprouts
3 tablespoons fish sauce, or to taste
1/2 cup cilantro leaves


Place the rice noodles in a large bowl of hot water until cooked, about 15 minutes.  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Fill a large bowl with hot water, and soak the rice wrapper sheets one at a time until softened, but still rather firm; about 20 seconds.  Place the sheets on a large dish cloth, separate from each other.  Place a mint leaf into the center of each wrapper.  Place two shrimp halves over the mint leaf, top with a small handful of the noodles, and 5 to 6 bean sprouts.  Season to taste with fish sauce, and garnish with cilantro leaves.
Roll them, burrito style, by folding the bottom of the wrapper over the filling in the center.  Fold in the left and right sides, then roll the entire thing away from you tightly.
