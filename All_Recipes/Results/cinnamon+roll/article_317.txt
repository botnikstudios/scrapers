Tomato Sauce:
1 (28 ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 (8 ounce) can tomato paste
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1 small yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons sea salt
3/4 head cauliflower
2 heads green cabbage
1 zucchini
2 eggs
1/4 cup almond flour


Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, 1 clove garlic, and 1 teaspoon parsley in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add tomato paste. Fill the can 1/4 of the way with hot water; swirl to dissolve any tomato paste remaining in the can and pour into the saucepan. Season sauce with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Simmer until flavors combine, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix beef, pork, onion, 3 cloves garlic, basil, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a large bowl.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 2 tablespoons sea salt. Add cauliflower; cook for 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Add 1 head of cabbage to the boiling water; cook for 5 minutes. Remove with the slotted spoon. Repeat with second cabbage. Separate cabbage leaves.
Shred cauliflower and zucchini in a food processor fitted with the shredder disk. Add enough to the beef mixture so there is an equal ratio of both. Stir in eggs and almond flour.
Lay 1 cabbage leaf on a flat surface. Roll 1 tablespoon of the beef mixture into a log and place in the middle of the leaf. Overlap with the bottom of the leaf; fold in opposing edges and roll up. Repeat with remaining leaves and beef mixture.
Coat the bottom of a large baking dish with a layer of tomato sauce. Arrange cabbage rolls seam-side down in the dish; cover with remaining tomato sauce. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, about 1 hour.
