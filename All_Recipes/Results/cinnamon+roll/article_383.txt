1 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
freshly ground black pepper to taste


Mix together brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, mustard powder, onion powder, and pepper in a bowl until well blended. Makes enough rub to cover one 3 to 5 pound ham. To be sure sugars form a crust, do not cover the ham during cooking. If not using immediately, store in an airtight tin.
