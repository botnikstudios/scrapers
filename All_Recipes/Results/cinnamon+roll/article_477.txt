2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup milk
1/3 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup raisins


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add milk all at once to dry ingredients and stir with a fork until a soft dough is formed.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 8 to 10 times.  Roll out to a 12 inch square.
Gently spread butter over dough.  Combine brown sugar, cinnamon and raisins.  Sprinkle evenly on top of dough.  Roll up dough lightly like a jelly-roll.  Seal edge.  Cut into twelve 1 inch thick pieces.  Place in prepared muffin tins.
Bake in preheated oven for 14 to 18 minutes, until golden. Remove from heat immediately. Serve warm.
