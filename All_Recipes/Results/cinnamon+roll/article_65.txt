non-stick cooking spray
2 cups whole wheat and flax flour (such as Robin Hood® Nutri Flour Blend™ Omega-3 & Fibre)
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 eggs
2 cups buttermilk
5 tablespoons melted butter, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions and spray with non-stick cooking spray.

Pour about 1/3 cup batter into waffle iron; close lid and bake until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, keeping waffles warm.
Whisk brown sugar, 3 tablespoons melted butter, hot water, and cinnamon together in a small microwave-safe bowl; cook in the microwave on High until cinnamon drizzle can be poured, about 10 seconds.
Whisk confectioners' sugar, skim milk, and 1 tablespoon melted butter together in a small bowl until icing drizzle is smooth and can be poured.
