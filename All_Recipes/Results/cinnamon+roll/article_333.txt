1 1/2 cups self-rising flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon nutmeg
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
6 eggs
1 1/3 cups canned pumpkin puree
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch pan.
Combine the self-rising flour, white sugar, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  Stir in the pumpkin, then beat in the eggs, one at a time, until blended.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Immediately turn cake out onto a damp cotton towel.  Starting from a long side, roll cake with the towel jelly-roll fashion. Cool cake roll, seam side down, on wire rack until completely cool, about 1 hour.  Gently unroll to fill.
To make the cream cheese filling:  Cream together the butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Beat in the confectioners' sugar, mixing until smooth.
