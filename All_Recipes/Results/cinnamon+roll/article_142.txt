1 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup warm water
3 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon molasses
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup quick cooking oats
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons yeast


Place ingredients in bread machine pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Dough Cycle, then press Start.
When the cycle is complete, transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and divide into 24 rolls. Cover with a towel and let rolls rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
Arrange the rolls on the prepared baking sheet, and bake 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
