4 Bartlett pears, about 8 oz. each
1/2 cup Holland HouseÂ® Marsala Cooking Wine
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
2 tablespoons butter
Vanilla ice cream
Toasted pecans (optional)


Cut pears in half lengthwise and remove cores. Measure Marsala cooking wine into a small mixing bowl. Add brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg; stir to dissolve sugar.
Melt butter in a large 12-inch skillet. Stir in Marsala mixture. Cook over medium heat until bubbly. Place pears in pan, cut side down. Cover and cook over medium-low heat 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 30-45 minutes or until cool enough to serve.
Place each pear half in a small bowl. Stir remaining sauce in pan; drizzle each serving with 1-2 teaspoons warm sauce. Top with a small scoop of ice cream, and if desired, toasted pecans. Serve immediately.
