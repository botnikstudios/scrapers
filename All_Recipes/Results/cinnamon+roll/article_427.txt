1 (15 ounce) can canned pumpkin puree
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix with pudding
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, softened
4 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Whisk together the pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix together the cake mix and oil.  Beat in the eggs, then fold in the pumpkin mixture.  Stir in the vanilla.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
To make cream cheese frosting:  Cream together the butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Beat in the confectioners' sugar, mixing until smooth.  Stir in the cinnamon and vanilla.  Spread frosting over cooled cake.
