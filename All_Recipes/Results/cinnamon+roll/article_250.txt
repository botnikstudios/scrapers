2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon


Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Flatten one tube of crescent roll dough, and press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese with 1 cup sugar and vanilla until smooth. Spread the cream cheese mixture over the dough in the pan. Unroll the remaining crescent roll dough, and place over the top of the cream cheese layer. Spread melted butter over the top, and sprinkle the top with a mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until top is lightly toasted. Cool, and refrigerate before serving.
