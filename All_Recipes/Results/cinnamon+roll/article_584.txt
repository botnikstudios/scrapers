1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon


Beat butter and 1 cup sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat egg and vanilla extract into the butter until completely blended. Add flour, cinnamon, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt; continue mixing until flour is just incorporated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl; spread onto a flat surface.
Divide dough into about 60 small balls. Roll balls in cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat. Arrange onto baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
