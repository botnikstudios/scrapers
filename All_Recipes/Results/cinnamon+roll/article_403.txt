1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups mashed, cooked butternut squash
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup raisins
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder


Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy.  Beat in the eggs and squash. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and spices; add to mixture, stirring until well blended. Stir in raisins and nuts. Spoon onto cookie sheets spacing cookies 2 inches apart.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until edges are golden.
