1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons rum extract
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
4 slices white bread
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed


Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, rum extract, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a bowl. Dip each bread slice into the egg mixture, turning to coat both sides.
Melt butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add bread slices in a single layer and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
