3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon wheat gluten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable shortening
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon water, or more as needed
21 tablespoons whole wheat flour, or as needed


Mix 3/4 cup flour, gluten, and salt together in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture using a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Mix 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon water into the flour mixture using your hands until dough easily forms a ball; add more water if needed.
Flatten dough into a pancake-like shape on a floured surface; sprinkle top of dough liberally with about 1 tablespoon flour. Roll dough, using a rolling pin, into a thin pie crust about 1-inch larger than your pie pan. Roll the crust onto the rolling pin and transfer to the pie pan.
