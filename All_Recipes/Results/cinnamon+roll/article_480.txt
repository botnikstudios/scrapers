2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup orange juice
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place carrots into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Whisk butter, orange juice, brown sugar, white sugar, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until sugars are dissolved. Add carrots to the glaze mixture; toss to coat. Transfer carrots and glaze to a 1-quart baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until carrots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
