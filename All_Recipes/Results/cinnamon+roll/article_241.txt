1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
1/2 cup salted butter, melted


Grease 12 muffin cups.
Place Parmesan cheese into a shallow bowl.
Cut thawed bread dough into 12 pieces, then cut each piece into 3 more pieces, for a total of 36.
Roll each piece into a ball and dip into the melted butter.
Gently press the buttered dough ball into the Parmesan cheese.
Place 3 coated balls into each prepared muffin cup.
Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, 5 to 7 hours, depending on the room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
