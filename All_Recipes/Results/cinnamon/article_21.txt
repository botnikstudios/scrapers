1 1/2 cups shortening
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup light molasses
4 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 (10 ounce) package HERSHEYÂ®'S Cinnamon Chips
1 cup white sugar for decoration


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees F).
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and 2 cups sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and molasses. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and ginger; stir into the sugar mixture until well blended. Mix in cinnamon chips. Dough will be stiff. Roll into walnut sized balls and roll each ball in remaining sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet and flatten slightly.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tops are crackled. Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
