In the creepy music video for her new biting single “Look What You Made Me Do,” Taylor Swift turns the tables on her haters by mocking all the very specific hits her reputation has taken over her entire career.
From being disingenuous to collecting friends to constantly playing the victim, the Grammy winner, 27, doesn’t let a single criticism slide by. Here’s everything she addresses in the Joseph Kahn-directed video:
1. She’s a lying snake that can’t be trusted.
In several scenes, Swift — dripping in snake jewels — is seen sitting on a throne with a legion of snakes slithering around her. The arm of her throne and columns inside the room have the words “ET TU BRUTE” etched onto them.
MTV
Last summer, Swift’s haters flooded her social media pages with the snake emoji after Kim Kardashian West characterized the singer as the reptile. “Wait it’s legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days!” the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star tweeted shortly before leaking a phone call between her husband, Kanye West, and Swift that she claimed proved Swift approved of the rapper’s “Famous” lyrics.
The “Out of the Woods” singer later asserted that West, 40, never told her he was going to call her “that bitch” in the song. “You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote. “He promised to play the song for me, but he never did.”
Swift and West have had a complicated relationship since he interrupted her VMAs acceptance speech in 2009.
2. She’s a controlling man-eater.
Perhaps the most enduring reputation Swift has had since kicking off her career is that she’s a boy-crazy revenge seeker.
In 2013, she became a punchline at the Golden Globes when hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler joked that Swift should “stay away from Michael J. Fox’s son” and use “some ‘me time’ to learn about herself.” Swift later told Vanity Fair Katie Couric was one of her “favorite people” because she taught her Madeleine Albright’s quote: “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.”

The star faces this characterization head-on at several points in the music video. In one scene, she swings a baseball bat while rocking a sweatshirt with a tiger and the words “BLIND FOR LOVE” on it.
During her high-profile relationship with actor Tom Hiddleston, the stars were mercilessly mocked after he was photographed wearing an “I ❤ TS” tank top at her annual Fourth of July bash. Her all-male backup dancers in the music video whip off their jackets to reveal the same phrase on their tops.
3. She collects friends who fall into very specific categories (think models).
Next up in the video is Swift in control at “Squad U,” where she is mass-producing and whipping thin, bot-like women into shape. The singer has often been criticized for being a fake feminist and seemingly only making friends with Victoria’s Secret models.

“To be honest, and this will probably get me in trouble … I don’t see anybody in any sort of squad that has a normal body,” fellow singer Demi Lovato previously told Glamour. “It’s kind of this false image of what people should look like. And what they should be like, and it’s not real. I think that having a song and a video about tearing Katy Perry down, that’s not women’s empowerment.”
4. She’s disingenuous. 
For a string of awards shows earlier in her career, Swift had a signature “shocked” face after picking up award after award, which earned her backlash from critics who said her response was fake.
“Swift had already won two awards when she took her third of the evening: the Artist of the Year honor,” wrote the Washington Post after the 2011 American Music Awards. “Really, it shouldn’t have been a huge surprise. But when Swift’s name was announced, you would have thought that someone had just told the singer the Earth is square, Thanksgiving has been postponed until March and the sky and the ground have now officially switched places.”
MTV
In the last 30 seconds of the music video, “dead Taylor” tells a younger version of herself to “Stop making that surprise face. It’s so annoying!” Adds the “Shake It Off” Taylor: “Yeah, you can’t possibly be that surprised all the time.”
The star — who notably stopped showing surprise or shock while winning awards in recent years — previously responded to the controversy by telling Nightline she wasn’t faking it.

“People make so much fun of me for that,” she said in 2012. “I just, I don’t know. It’s like, if you win an award, isn’t that crazy? How do you sit there and be like, ‘Oh, another Grammy. I guess I’m gonna get that now?”
5. She’s always the victim.
Between her feuds with Perry and West and a tricky breakup with ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris, Swift has earned a reputation of always playing the victim. In fact, it remained one of the biggest criticisms after she released her new single (“Taylor Swift Hasn’t Shed Her Old Skin. She’s Still Playing the Victim,” read one headline).
Naysayers claim the star fans the flames of her own fights and manipulates people in her life to create fodder for her hit songs.
“Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though,” tweeted Harris last summer after it was revealed Swift co-wrote their hit song, “This Is What You Came For.”

“I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,” he continued. “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it.”
In Swift’s music video, the Red-era Taylor tells an even younger version of herself to “stop acting like you’re all nice” while yet another says, “There she goes playing the victim again.”



Taylor Swift is going to a dark place with the music video for her new single “Look What You Made Me Do.”
The Grammy winner, 27, unveiled the video — which turns the tables on the criticism thrown her way throughout her career — at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday.
The video kicks off with a “dead” Swift (wearing the dress from her “Out of the Woods” music video) crawling out of a “Taylor Swift’s Reputation” grave juxtaposed with a shot of the star lying in a diamond-filled bathtub. The “dead Taylor” also shovels dirt onto a 2014 Met Ball-version of Swift.
Other clips include Swift sitting on a throne commanding her legion of snakes, swinging in a golden cage and posing with a Grammy award after crashing her car into a pole as the paparazzi snap photos.

In another scene, the star rips off a cat mask while wearing a sweatshirt with a tiger and the words “BLIND FOR LOVE” on it. Her backup dancers in another scene who wait on her hand and foot are also all wearing cut-off shirts with the words “I ❤ TS” on them, a clear jab at those who made fun of her ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston for wearing a similar tank while they were dating.

Swift is also the ring leader at “Squad U,” where lines of identical women follow her rules. The scene is also reminiscent of West’s Yeezy fashion show.
The video evolves into Swift standing on a pile of Taylors from the past, including from her “You Belong with Me” video (except this version is wearing a T-shirt with the names of her “squad” — Selena Gomez, Martha Hunt, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Lena Dunham and more — written on it).
Other versions of Swift include the one from her “Shake It Off” music video, from her Fearless era and from the 2015 Billboard Music Awards (where she and ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris kissed after she received an award).

The last 30 seconds of the music video shows all the various Taylors arguing with each other, saying things her haters have accused her of over the last several years.
“Stop making that surprise face. It’s so annoying!” dead Taylor tells “You Belong with Me” Taylor. Adds the “Shake It Off” Taylor: “Yeah, you can’t possibly be that surprised all the time.”
“What’s that, bitch?” adds another, while dead Taylor shoots back, “Don’t call me that.”

“Oh, stop acting like you’re all nice. You are so fake,” the Red-era Taylor tells the Fearless Taylor. And yet another says, “There she goes playing the victim again.”

The video ends with the 2009 VMAs-Taylor repeating what Swift said in an Instagram caption she posted when hitting back at Kim Kardashian West, who leaked a phone call between Swift and her husband Kanye West last summer: “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.”
“Oh shut up!” the 14 other Taylors scream in unison.

On Saturday, director Joseph Kahn told a fan on Twitter he and Swift began working on the video at the start of the year before shooting it in May.


We started concepting and prepping it in January. Shot in May. Post production until tomorrow morning. You see it Sssssssunday. 🐍 https://t.co/XdAWI6Smc7

On Friday, the star gave her fans a sneak peek of the Joseph Kahn-directed video on Good Morning America hours after releasing the song, which is her first solo single in three years.

The song is co-written by the “Shake It Off” singer, 27, and her longtime pal Jack Antonoff, who also produced several tracks off her last album 1989.
According to a press release, the single is the first song off Swift’s upcoming album, Reputation, which will be released on Nov. 10.



 
While Taylor Swift can claim one of the most iconic MTV Video Music Awards moments ever, her history with the show spans red carpet slays, buzzworthy performances and, of course, cameos from her famous squad. Scroll down to immerse yourself in every major moment of Taylor Swift at the VMAs as you prepare yourself for the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video premiere at Sunday’s show.
Taylor made her first VMAs appearance in 2008, resplendent in fluffy curls and a sweet white dress. It was the perfect VMAs debut look for America’s newest country sweetheart.

The singer kicked off her VMAs career on a strong note, interviewing celebs on the red carpet. Oh, and did we mention that she was nominated for the artist to watch category alongside Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus?
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
In 2009, Taylor’s return to the VMAs was even more exciting: She rolled up in a literal carriage, because why not, and made us all instantly question why we wanted cars for our 16th birthdays.
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
Of course, 2009 was also the year that Kanye West famously stagecrashed Taylor Swift after she won the best female video award for “You Belong with Me.”

The singer handled the shocking moment with grace, and in 2013, Vanity Fair even revealed that she has a framed photo of the incident in her house.

Believe it or not, her night wasn’t over yet.

Swift performed “You Belong with Me” on a moving subway (which might be the most glamorous thing to ever happen on the subway).

Swift capped off one heckuva eventful night when Beyoncé brought her up to give her back her moment.

How do you follow up an awards show like that? In 2010, Taylor was back to perform “Innocent,” which was inspired by the previous year’s interruption. “I think a lot of people expected me to write a song about him. But for me it was important to write a song to him,” she told New York magazine of West.

The emotional performance included a clip from the stagecrash and a barefoot Swift.

Taylor went on a brief VMAs hiatus, returning to the awards show in 2012. With freshly chopped bangs and now-signature lipstick, the singer was beginning to usher in the Red era.

Of course, she took to the stage (in stripes!) to perform “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.”

Take a moment to relive the glory that’s now a half-decade old.

The next year, Taylor walked the carpet in an ultra form-fitting navy gown and faux bob. (A sign of haircuts to come?)

In 2013, she also scooped up a best female video award for “I Knew You Were Trouble.”

Taylor didn’t slow down in 2014, walking the carpet in sky-high heels and a blue romper.

She was about to drop her fifth studio album, 1989, and performed a very sparkly rendition of “Shake It Off.”

Seriously. We will never be over the spangly two-piece and the tux-clad dancers.

However, nothing could ever prepare us for Taylor’s 2015 entrance. She was nominated for “Bad Blood,” so it only made sense that she brought her squad as her date(s).
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
Speaking of “Bad Blood,” yes, it won the video of the year honor.

She also took to the stage to perform a “The Night Is Still Young/ Bad Blood” mash-up with Nicki Minaj. (The performance squashed any rumors of beef between the two musicians, who got in a Twitter tiff ahead of the awards over a lack of diversity among nominees.)

The singer capped off her night by presenting Kanye West with the iconic Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.

While Taylor opted out of the awards the next two years, she left fans absolutely shook when she premiered her “Look What You Made Me Do” video during the 2017 show. 

The audience was still reeling from the epic visual (so many iconic Taylors!) when the singer and Zayn won the best collaboration award for their song “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever.” In their absence, co-writer Jack Antonoff stepped up to the mic to accept the trophy.


Taylor Swift could be in attendance at Sunday’s 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.
A source close to the “Look What You Made Me Do” singer, 27, hints to PEOPLE that she may be hitting up the ceremony in Inglewood, California — where Swift and Zayn Malik are up for the best collaboration award for their song “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker).”
“Taylor is very excited about her new album,” says the source. “This has been her life for the past months. She is very excited to share it with her fans. She is also ready to come out of hiding.”
If she does end up attending, the VMAs would be Swift’s first awards show appearance since the CMA Awards in November, where she presented Garth Brooks with the entertainer of the year award.

Swift gave a sneak peek of the video Friday on Good Morning America hours after releasing the song, which is her first solo single in three years.
She and Malik are up against five other nominees in their VMAs category, including one for the song “Feels” by Swift’s ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris featuring Pharrell Williams, Big Sean and Katy Perry (who will also host).

Following the release of “Look What You Made Me Do” and its accompanying lyric video, rumors circulated that the country-turned-pop songstress would be taking the stage at Sunday’s awards show. But VMAs executive producer Jesse Ignjatovic set the record straight.
“She has been on the show many times and [has] performed with a new album coming, but not this time,” Ignjatovic told PEOPLE. “I definitely wish she was coming on and performing.”
Reputation, out Nov. 10, is available for pre-order now.



Look what you made her do: Taylor Swift broke streaming records on Spotify and YouTube with her new single, “Look What You Made Me Do.”
As reported by The Associated Press, Swift’s track was streamed more than 8 million times on its first day of release; the song grabbed 19 million views on YouTube during the same period. Both numbers are records.
In addition, Billboard reports “Look What You Made Me Do” could sell 500,000 digital copies in its first week, which would give Swift the biggest sales week since Adele’s “Hello” dropped in 2015.
Swift released “Look What You Made Me Do” on Thursday night and created an immediate online sensation. Swift’s video for the song will debut Sunday night during the MTV Video Music Awards, hosted by Katy Perry.

The Beyhive may see similarities between a teaser clip of Taylor Swift‘s video for her biting new single “Look What You Made Me Do” and Beyoncé’s 2016 Lemonade visual album, but Swift’s video director Joseph Kahn isn’t having it.
On Friday night, the Grammy-winning director — who shot Swift’s “Bad Blood,” “Out of the Woods,” “Wildest Dreams” and “Blank Space” videos as well as Destiny’s Child’s “Say My Name” and “Jumpin’ Jumpin'” — tweeted his reaction to fan speculation that Tay was making a dig at Bey.
“I’ve worked with Beyoncé a few times,” he wrote. “She’s an amazing person. The #LWYMMDvideo is not in her art space. Love and respect to Bey.”

One shot in particular seemed to bother fans. It showed the 27-year-old country singer dressed in a black ensemble, lined up in an elegant pose with a row of male backup dancers behind her. The shot looked similar to scenes from Beyoncé’s “Formation” video and Super Bowl 50 performance, in which she donned a similar look with an army of fierce female backup dancers.
Another Lemonade track, “Sorry,” found Beyoncé and Serena Williams dancing in the halls of a lavish Louisiana plantation while wearing black leotards.
“Beyoncé played on being a plantation owner in Formation & now that Taylor Swift is ripping from it she’s trying to be one too,” wrote one critic on Twitter.
“Lemonade and Minute Maid,” someone quipped.
Another echoed: “The song is a poor man’s Britney, the video’s gonna be a poor man’s Beyoncé. Taylor Swift wants to be anyone but Taylor Swift.”

Kahn had responses to that too.
“There’s something to that ‘Formation’ shot I painted out and you haven’t seen yet,” he wrote, teasing the video’s upcoming premiere at Sunday’s MTV Video Music Awards. “Stay tuned Sunday 🙂 #LWYMMDvideo #SneakyAsian,” Kahn added.
Hours earlier, he made another comment about the comparisons, joking, “Before video release: Kahn copying Lemonade. After video release: Kahn copying obscure K Pop video made in North Korean prison in 2006.”

Swift dropped “Look What You Made Me Do” – a dark track off of her upcoming album, Reputation – on Thursday night, later debuting the first-look video preview on Friday’s Good Morning America. 
Though the song, which samples 1991 Right Said Fred hit “I’m Too Sexy,” is getting mixed reviews, it’s certainly a stunning departure for Swift. Rather than shaking off her haters, the singer/songwriter appears to be taking some direct jabs at her enemies.
“I don’t like you,” she sings in the song’s verse, without naming anyone in particular.

It may not be a direct attack on anyone, despite rampant speculation. Swift may be once again turning the tables on her haters by poking fun at the media’s perception of her as someone who always plays the victim — the same way her smash hit “Blank Space” (off of her Grammy-winning album 1989) mocked the portrayal of her as a man-eater.
“[From] 2013 to 2013, they thought I was dating too much because I dated two people in a year and a half, but whatever — we’ll leave it there,” she said during an interview with NME in 2014. “‘Oh, a serial dater. She only writes songs to get emotional revenge on guys. She’s a man hater. Don’t let her near your boyfriend.’ It was just kind of excessive and, you know, at first it was hurtful and then I kind of found a little comedy in it.”
“This character is so interesting though,” she added at the time. “If you go and read these gossip sites and they describe how I am, [it’s] so opposite my actual life.”
Swift’s sixth album, Reputation, will be released on Nov. 10.
