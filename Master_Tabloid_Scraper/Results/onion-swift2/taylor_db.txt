Kim Kardashian and Kanye West think Taylor Swift is playing the victim card again — and they’re totally over it.

Though the Kimye name have been plastered on every tabloid headline out there since the release of the Look What You Made Do music video, which takes aim at the couple and alludes to them as being a pair of backstabbers, sources close to the parents-of-two claim Taylor is actually the instigator in this situation and only reigniting the feud as a way to sell records.
Via TMZ:
Our Kim and Kanye sources say their well-publicized feud — triggered by Kanye’s song Famous in which he referenced Taylor with the lyric, I made that b*tch famous — is old and buried.
As for Kanye, our sources say there are certain feuds he deeply cares about … like the one in which he’s embroiled with Jay-Z and Tidal. As one well-connected source put it, They’re like brothers who fight but feel bad about it and always end up coming together. Taylor, on the other hand, isn’t even on his radar.

Taylor Swift’s digs at Kanye West go further than just her scathing lyrics.

The singer — who recently released Look What You Made Me Do, a single that seemingly takes aim at the rapper and his wife, Kim Kardashian — will release her sixth studio album on a date that hits close to her nemesis’ heart. As fans have pointed out, November 10 holds a significant meaning in the Kardashian-West family as it marks the anniversary of the death of Kanye’s mother.
Via Wet Paint:
While this could be just a coincidence, it’s hard for fans to overlook, considering how hard the rapper took his mother’s passing.
After all, he was raised by her as a single mother and the two were quite close. In fact, just last year, he had a breakdown that coincided with the death anniversary.
Find out why that date was specifically chosen over at Wet Paint…

Katy has said publicly that she "truly wants to come together" and end her long-running feud with her fellow pop diva.

The Spanish-language track has been topping charts and breaking records—such as most watched video on YouTube—all summer long but now, people are calling for the Despacito frenzy to end. If the song makes it just one more week at the top of the Hot 100 chart, it will take the throne as the longest-running song at No. 1 of all time, and Mariah Carey fans are not happy. They are subsequently rooting for Taylor Swift’s newest song Look What You Made Me Do to reach the top of the charts to end the Despacito streak.Fans of Carey anxiously awaited the release of T.Swift’s LWYMMD and since it dropped, they’ve urged people to stream the song as much as possible. Taylor needs to release her new single before Despacito beats Mariah's record.

It also set records on Spotify’s for its first 24 hours and according to Nielson, it was the most-played song on U.S. radio last Friday with 4,228 plays. /nThe director of Taylor Swift’s music video for her polarizing new single Look What You Made Me Do has called out the double standards faced by Swift and other women.Joseph Kahn, a frequent Swift collaborator — who previously helmed the videos for Blank Space,Bad Blood, and Wildest Dreams — tweeted Wednesday, If I plan something as a man I’m a ‘genius.’ If Taylor as a woman plans something she is ‘manipulative.’ Double standards. This is wrong.If I plan something as a man I'm a "genius." If Taylor as a woman plans something she is "manipulative." Double standards. This is wrong.— Joseph Kahn (@JosephKahn) August 30, 2017like you said… https://t.co/Ab7tSOrxsG— Shiggles (@Shiggles510) August 30, 2017One of the most observed figures in pop culture, Swift has drawn intense scrutiny since the release of Look What You Made Me Do last week. In the first single from her forthcoming album Reputation (and its accompanying video), she declares that the old Taylor is dead and seemingly alludes to her former relationships with Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston and feuds with Katy Perry, Kanye West, and Kim Kardashian.RELATED VIDEO: All The Criticism Taylor Swift Is Slamming In ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ Music VideoWhile the song has already smashed several records, it has also divided fans and inspired some unflattering think pieces. Vulture‘s Mark Harris, for example, called the song an anthem that turns the abrogation of personal responsibility into a posturing statement of empowerment.Following Kahn’s initial tweet, the director retweeted a link to a Guardian opinion piece arguing that Swift is fighting an age-old battle with misogyny.Kahn previously defended the Look What You Made Me Do video amid allegations of ripping off Beyoncé’s Formation music video.This article originally appeared on Ew.com/nBefore there was a snake emoji-filled feud between Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian, there was admiration — at least from one party.In a newly discovered video from 2009, shared by Entertainment Tonight, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star gushed about the singer, even revealing that she’s a huge fan of her work.I love Taylor Swift, I’m the biggest Taylor Swift fan, Kardashian said during her red carpet interview, adding that her number one song on her iPod was Swift’s 2008 single, Love Story.I’m watching her on Twitter, I just signed up on Twitter. I’m watching you, Taylor, following, she concluded.Back in 2009, Kardashian had not been dating now-husband Kanye West so there were no signs of bad blood between her and Swift. Since Kim and Kanye later married, the rapper’s past becomes important to Kim’s future. And that time Kanye grabbed the mic from Taylor’s hands during her 2009 VMAs acceptance speech is the root of so much more.Fast forward to present day, Kardashian and Swift’s complicated relationship has been making headlines, especially after Kim released footage of Taylor and Kanye’s phone call about those Famous lyrics, as well as Taylor’s supposed rebuttal in the form of her new single, Look What You Made Me Do.Blast from the past! Back in 2009, Kim Kardashian proclaims she was Taylor Swift's "biggest fan." pic.twitter.com/RyBgeiyWqj— EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) August 30, 2017Then last summer, Swift and the West’s complicated relationship exploded after Kardashian West leaked a phone call between her husband and the saying that the reality star claimed proved Swift had approved of the rapper’s lyrics about her.Swift’s rep previously told PEOPLE that Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyrics, ‘I made that bitch famous,’  and the Shake It Off singer also slammed the couple afterwards on her Instagram account. Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world, she wrote in a note.Though Taylor’s latest song sent shockwaves around the world, the Wests aren’t losing any sleep over the record-breaking single.Kim and Kanye don’t care about Taylor’s new music, a source previously told PEOPLE. They find it pathetic that she still tries to keep an old feud going. They are not going to give her or her new music any attention. They have more important things to focus on, like their family./nTaylor Swift is breaking records left and right with her new single Look What You Made Me Do, and her relationship with boyfriend Joe Alwyn is also stronger than ever.A source close to the Grammy winner, 27, tells PEOPLE exclusively the duo are still very happy together and continuing to spend time with each other out of the spotlight.Her decision to keep her relationship with Joe quiet is making her happy, says the source. They have been getting to know each other slowly without any pressure.For all the details on Swift’s new music and her life now, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.Earlier this year, Swift spent an extended period of time with Alwyn in the U.K. while he filmed his upcoming movie The Favourite.FROM PEN: EW’s Top Ten Rom-Com Movie MomentsThe actor also often visits his girlfriend in the States and is very happy about spending time at home with Taylor, adds the source. They seem to be on the same page. Joe is getting to know Taylor’s parents and everyone likes him. He is very supportive of her work.Last week, the singer dropped her new scathing pop track that satirizes her public persona and hits back at her haters, including famous ones like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West.The star smashed records with her dramatic music video for Look, racking up more than 40 million views in 24 hours on YouTube.Her album Reputation is out Nov. 10. /nDid you think she’d return quietly? Think again.Taylor Swift dropped the first single off her forthcoming album Reputation (due Nov. 10) last Friday, and despite its polarizing response, Look What You Made Me Do has toppled, well, just about every record it could in a very short amount of time. Here, EW looks at the accusatory cut’s mighty ascent.The Jack Antonoff co-write was streamed 10.1 million times in its first 24 hours, helping Swift beat two records at the same time: the most day-one streams and the largest streaming day for a single song on Spotify.No, we’re not even talking about that video yet. When Swift dropped her new ditty, she loaded its animated lyric video onto YouTube, which quickly amassed more than 19 million cues on release day. That’s more than double what was earned by the previous record holder, the Chainsmokers’ Something Just Like This feat. Coldplay.Psy’s Gentleman can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, ’cause it’s dead! Swift’s Easter egg-packed clip debuted during the Katy Perry-hosted MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday and immediately began racking up repeat plays. According to YouTube, the video averaged over 30,000 views per minute in its first 24 hours, and hourly views reached over 3 million views. Amassing 43.2 million views in 24 hours, Swift easily bested easily Psy’s 2013 record of 36 million views in its first 24 hours.Swift’s star-packed Bad Blood video earned 20 million views in 24 hours when it was released in 2014, but that was overtaken by Adele in 2015 when Hello broke the internet with 27.7 streams. Swift has righted her own course, as LWYMMD notched more than 28 million streams with hours left to spare. Hello, indeed!RELATED VIDEO: Grammy News and Notes: Album of the Year NomineesThe single could sell 500,000 downloads during its first week sales, which would make it the biggest sales week since Adele’s Hello, Billboard reported. It’s also poised to block Despacito from remaining at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 17 straight weeks.

[Fame causes] decreased privacy. And increased strain or pressure or stress associated with relationships. Friendships and dating relationships. When you are living out a relationship in the public eye, it’s definitely … it’s difficult. It has some extra constraints, because you have other opinions about your relationship, how it affects your work and, you know, just some inappropriate connections.
— to ESPN the Magazine Sophie Turner 
I found it easier to date someone who understands the industry or is in that world. You realize that you’re not going to see each other all the time. And you don’t feel like a jerk when you’re like, ‘My publicist says I can’t do this … ‘
— to InStyleJenny Slate 
It seems so naïve: You’re just talking to a nice person, and you have a really honest, beautiful conversation, and she writes about it in an honest, beautiful way. But then, it goes through all these other outlets and gets distilled. And then it can be made to seem like you were being cheap. … I didn’t mean to do that. Especially not with an experience that was so precious to me.There’s so much more teeth out there, so many invisible claws out on the internet. It’s one thing to be, like, Cloris Leachman in 1979, saying, ‘I f—d Gene Hackman,’ or whatever — that’s only going to be in one article, and if people want to find it, they’re going to have to go to the library and use the microfiche,

I have to be so psychologically strong about not letting other people’s interpretations about my life affect my life. A relationship exists between two people. We will always know what it was. The narratives that are out there altogether have been extrapolated from pictures that were taken without consent or permission, with no context. Nobody had the context for that [Fourth of July] story. And I’m still trying to work out a way of having a personal life and protecting it, but also without hiding.— to GQ Dating is a hard, hard thing when you have this job. Sometimes I wish I could just go back to Florida and, like, date my hometown boyfriend. It’s really frustrating whenever I can’t go and do something because I know it’s going to be on the internet.Like if I go to a friend’s house, they’ll be, ‘She’s dating him!’ It’s like, ‘Oh, am I dating my brother now? Is that what’s happening?’ Or when they write that I was with a ‘mystery man,’ and I’m like, ‘He’s gay, by the way, so it is a mystery!'
– to GQ[Dating another famous person] just puts a magnifying glass on you. If you want to be really famous, then date another famous person. But the fame is not the part of my life that I am excited about.I think you have to date someone who understands some aspects of the film industry. I mean, I’m going to be in Northern Ireland kissing Colin Farrell, so I have to date a guy who is really confident in himself and isn’t insecure about all of that.
– to The Telegraph[Public interest in my dating life] is so weird. It’s so out of thin air. If I was in a relationship I was happy with, I’d love to talk about it. But I don’t like to date. It takes a lot for me to be into somebody. By default I’m a monogamist. I want a partner in crime.– to PEOPLEJennifer LawrenceNo one ever asks me out. I am lonely every Saturday night. Guys are so mean to me. I know where it’s coming from, I know they’re trying to establish dominance, but it hurts my feelings. I’m just a girl who wants you to be nice to me. I am straight as an arrow. I feel like I need to meet a guy, with all due respect, who has been living in Baghdad for five years who has no idea who I am.
– to VogueI feel like watching my dating life has become a bit of a national pastime. And I’m just not comfortable providing that kind of entertainment anymore. I don’t like seeing slide shows of guys I’ve apparently dated. I don’t like giving comedians the opportunity to make jokes about me at awards shows. I don’t like it when headlines read ‘Careful, Bro, She’ll Write a Song About You,’ because it trivializes my work. And most of all, I don’t like how all these factors add up to build the pressure so high in a new relationship that it gets snuffed out before it even has a chance to start. And so, I just don’t date.
– to Rolling StoneWhen you break up in the public eye, it’s almost like you have to go through it twice: privately and publicly. I’ve been there, for sure, and it’s hard. You could be having a fight that you don’t necessarily want your family or friends to know about, and then all of a sudden it’s like the whole world knows your business. It’s humiliating. There’s so much that you want to keep private, just for the sake of your own pride, and when details get out to the tabloids or whatever, it’s like pouring salt into an open wound. It definitely makes it hard to close that chapter of your life.
– on her website and appIf you’re in a film and you’re an actor and your girlfriend is not an actor and you say, ‘Right, I’m going away for four months and, no, I won’t see you at all during that time’, that could go down really badly. The other person would just say, ‘Well, why don’t you just not take the job?’ whereas another actor would understand that’s just not something you would do.
– to MirrorI hate [dating]. It’s hard. I’m weirded out by the idea that a guy has Googled me before we meet, and that has happened.
– to InStyle UKI went through a phase when I was really mean because I was so fed up. Girls were running after [ex Zac Efron], and I was giving them death stares. Then I realized that’s not what that’s about. ‘Spread the love, be a good person, they support you, be nice.'
– to The New York TimesI don’t date people who are famous. I don’t think it’s fair that, all of a sudden, intimate details of their personal life are public as a direct result of me. I wish I could protect them.

"Taylor respects Karlie so much for doing her own thing and being smart. Taylor has so much admiration for her, especially for educating girls with coding."
Aww!!
It doesn't explain why Karlie's name was noticeably absent from LWYMMD, but we're sure fans will be happy to know the 25-year-old wasn't the backstabber Taylor subtly referenced in the music video!

ICYMI, Kanye West canceled his Saint Pablo tour in November 2016 after he was hospitalized at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital Center for a mental breakdown.
Most recently, West's company Very Good Touring, Inc. sued insurer Lloyd's of London for refusing to cover the contract's non-appearance fee, and wants $9.8 million plus interest.

Well now, Lloyd's is clapping back with a countersuit!
In court docs filed on Tuesday and obtained by People, the insurer explains they are not liable. Exclusions to the policy reportedly include preexisting physical or psychological condition, prescription drugs not taken as medically prescribed, possession of illegal drugs, and the consumption of alcohol rendering the insured unfit to "perform contracted duties."
Hmm!
They continued, adding: 

"Underwriters' investigation indicates substantial irregularities in Mr. West's medical history. Furthermore the insured's failure to cooperate in Underwriters' investigation is contrary to the duties of cooperation VGT agreed to as a condition precedent to any obligation of Underwriters to pay any claim arising under the Policies.
Throughout Underwriters' investigation, VGT and its legal, medical and other agents and representatives have delayed, hindered, stalled and or refused to provide information both relevant and necessary for Underwriters to complete their investigation of the claim. Underwriters are informed and believe, and thereon these same persons have willfully concealed and or misrepresented relevant facts in an effort to thwart Underwriters' investigation."
Kanye had previously stated that Lloyd's of London made him go to great lengths to prove his mental break was legit, but it seems the insurer just wants this resolved.
In addition to claiming no responsibility, they want declaratory relief — which basically means an official declaration of the status of a matter in controversy, and to not award him the payments requested! DUH!
Kayne's lawyer — Howard King — responded via TMZ on Wednesday, saying the countersuit:

"is the same generic response Lloyd's files when they don't want to honor a legitimate claim but can't find a factual basis to deny the claim."
Stay tuned for more on this drama soon!

Taylor Swift just bashed all the haters in her life with her newest single, Look What You Made Me Do and fans are freaking out!
After teasing her much-anticipated album, Reputation, the singer exposed some brutal lyrics in her new song.
While Swift has been involved in various feuds with A-listers such as Katy Perry, 32, and ex boyfriend Calvin Harris, it is Kanye West and Kim Kardashian fans believe she’s really after.
I don’t like your little games/ Don’t like your tilted stage/ The role you made me play/ Of the fool, no, I don’t like you/ I don’t like your perfect crime, she sings in the controversial new tune.

West, 40, infamously uses a tilted stage in his concert performances.
As RadarOnline.com exclusively reported, Kardashian and West vowed to bash Swift if she decided to insult them in her secret album.
Kanye is going to let Taylor have it if she goes after Kim on this new album, a source close to star told Radar. Kim is just tired of playing this game with Taylor. She has clearly had it out for the both of them, and Kim is so ready to fight fire with fire if this album includes any shade.
Swift has bad blood for West ever since he interrupted her MTV acceptance speak in 2009, but her feud with Kardashian, 36, began in 2016 when the pop star claimed she didn’t give West permission to say I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, because I made that b***h famous in his song Famous.

After Kardashian leaked footage of Swift appearing to approve the lyrics, things especially turned sour.
Wait it’s legit National Snake Day?!?!?!? They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! Kardashian tweeted after the incident.
As Radar readers know, Swift, 27, recently deleted all of the content from her social media accounts and teased her album by posting Instagram videos of a dark snake creeping between in the darkness.

Taylor Swift’s first single off her highly-anticipated album Reputation is about to drop, and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Kim Kardashian and hubby Kanye West are ready to wage war against the mudslinging singer.
Kanye is going to let Taylor have it if she goes after Kim on this new album, a source close to the KUWTK beauty, 36, said.
Kim is just tired of playing this game with Taylor. She has clearly had it out for the both of them, and Kim is so ready to fight fire with fire if this album includes any shade.

It’s about to get ugly, and Kim is ready to shut Taylor down!
The feud between Kardashian, West, 40, and Swift, 27, began last year, when the pop star claimed she didn’t give the rapper permission to say I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, because I made that b***h famous in his song Famous.
But then Kardashian posted footage of Swift approving of the lyrics — and later seemed to shade her by referring to National Snake Day.

Following the incident, Swift — who, up to that point had been incredibly active on social media — disappeared from the spotlight.
Until now!
After deleting all of the content from her social media accounts, which currently have over 100 million followers, Swift posted several GIFs to promote her new album. And it appeared to be aimed at Kardashian!

Katy Perry has been told to play it cool when she makes her debut as a judge on American Idol.
The Firework singer is reportedly being paid $25 million by ABC for the gig, but that huge fee has reportedly come with some conditions attached.
A source revealed to RadarOnline.com: They want a more modulated and thoughtful Katy. It’s not like they’re asking her to change her hairstyle or revise her style team, but they are asking her not to upstage the contestants the way some past judges, especially Mariah Carey, had the tendency to do.
PHOTOS: Katy Perry & Orlando Bloom Keep Their Heads Down On NYC Date
They want the show to be disciplined and taken as seriously as the Oscars instead of taking on the circus atmosphere that has made The Voice such a big hit.
One idea being floated is that the audience would see Perry, 32, judging the show in just her sweat pants or dressing gown.
This would show her in a more down-to-earth style as opposed to her often over the top glam queen image.
Perry – who has been linked to Orlando Bloom once again – is delighted to be back.

After landing the judging spot on AI she said: I am honored and thrilled to be the first judge bringing back the American Idol tradition of making dreams come true for incredible talents with authentic personalities and real stories.
I’m always listening to new music, and love discovering diamonds in the rough — from mentoring young artists on my label, or highlighting new artists on my tours, I want to bring it back to the music.

Jay-Z is blasting frenemy Kanye West after Kim Kardashian’s husband made weird remarks about him and his wife Beyonce last year.
While discussing his provocative song Kill Jay Z with Rap Radar host Elliott Wilson and Brian B. Dot Miller, in which the rap star slammed West, Jay-Z said he got hurt, because this guy was talking about you on a stage.
PHOTOS: Kim & Kanye SNUB Beyoncé’s ‘VMA’ Performance Backstage
t was a reference to West’s bizarre concert rant on November 16 at a concert in Sacramento last year that stoked a bitter feud between the two men and their famous wives.
Jay-Z commented, …what really hurt me, you can’t bring my kid or my wife into it. … We’ve gotten past bigger issues, but you brought my family into it, now it’s a problem with me.
PHOTOS: Beyonce’s Mom Gets Married! Her New Husband’s Secret Scientology Past Revealed In 10 Clicks
Jay-Z added, You know it’s a problem because me and him would have been talked about it, been resolved our issues. And he knows crossed the line. He knows. And I know he knows. ‘Cause we’ve never let this much space go between one of our disagreements and we’ve had many. That’s part of who we are.
The two rappers were friends until West, 40, went off the deep end at the concert last year. Then, he called out Jay-Z and wife Beyonce in regards to the 2009 incident when West rudely interrupted Taylor Swift’s’s Video Music Awards acceptance speech to say that Beyoncé deserved to win.
I went down seven years on behalf of you, West said. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I hear that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over ‘Hotline Bling,' West said, alluding to the Formation singer’s win over him and Drake at the VMAs in August 2016.
West continued in front of fans back in November, In my opinion — now don’t go dissing Beyoncé, she’s great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win.
In his Rap Radar interview, Jay-Z, 47, let people know he was outraged about West’s tirade. However, he also shrugged about his single which appeared to hit back at West, It’s not even about a Kanye diss. It’s not a diss, I’m talking to myself the whole time.
In the single, Jay-Z rapped, I know people backstab you, I feel bad too/ But this ‘f— everybody’ attitude ain’t natural/ But you ain’t the same, this ain’t KumbaYe/ But you got hurt because you did cool by ‘Ye/ You gave him 20 million without blinkin’/ He gave you 20 minutes on stage, f— was he thinkin’?/ ‘F— wrong with everybody?’ is what you sayin’/ But if everybody’s crazy, you’re the one that’s insane.
During his Rap Radar chat, Jay-Z clarified, I’m not talking about Kanye when I say, ‘You dropped out of school, you lost your principles,’ I’m talking about me!
However, West has raised eyebrows by also directly addressing his Watch the Throne collaborator in the past, saying: JAY-Z — call me, bruh. You still ain’t called me. Jay Z, I know you got killers. Please don’t send them at my head.

As Radar has previously reported, West cutting his ties with Tidal, the music streaming company launched by Jay-Z back in 2015, is part of their explosive feud. 
West was rushed to the hospital over safety concerns after his concert meltdown last November.
The two stars’ wives have also been involved in the battle, as Radar has reported. Kardashian and Beyonce have feuded over the spotlight, sources said.

Taylor Swift and Katy Perry have waged war against each other for years, but could the MTV Video Music Awards finally put an end to their bitter feud?
In the past they have teamed up Madonna and Britney and other big stunts [at the show], an insider told RadarOnline.com. This year they don’t have anything huge and are begging to bring peace to Taylor and Katy.
Katy is the host of the awards and she is cool with having Taylor join her onstage, continued the insider, adding, however, Taylor isn’t so keen.
Perry, 32, recently indicated she’d be willing to let bygones be bygones with 27-year-old Swift.

I forgive her and I’m sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from her, Perry said on the Thrive Global podcast. I think it’s actually like, I think it’s time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I’m saying? And I love her, and I want the best for her.
Now, if the show’s organizers can somehow convince Swift to call a temporary ceasefire, there’s already a plan in place on how to proceed.
They won’t perform together but would take the stage and pretend together, said the insider. It would be like 1998 when Mariah and Whitney appeared together in the same dress.
A Swift and Perry joint act would be a much-needed bump in excitement for the show.

The music business is a mess, said the insider. Pink is getting the Michael Jackson awards, but no one is excited about that.
We need to create a moment that goes viral; something that blows up the Internet, insisted the insider.
And if Swift digs in her heels and refuses the idea, MTV has another big idea.
Revealed the insider: Producers are also begging Beyonce to make her first post twins appearance.

Taylor Swift is fast wearing out her Hollywood welcome and RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively the pop singer has since become horrified by the backlash she’s received from her latest publicity stunt through a Kimye diss track.

While Swift thought everyone would think it was a stroke of genius, mostly people are just sick of her blatant grabs for attention and just rolled their eyes, says an industry insider.
Where does it stop? a pal close to the situation noted, adding, First she kisses and tells about every celebrity she’s ever dated, then she sets up obviously fake relationships to get press, and now this. Where does it end?
PHOTOS: Kanye West & Calvin Harris Slam Taylor Swift At The VMAs
The informant reveals to Radar there’s a real backlash against the singer now, which is why you don’t see her surrounded by famous friends anymore. No one is sure if they’re just pawns in her publicity game. Taylor is horrified by the response – there’s just been one backlash against her after another recently, our snitch pills.
To make matters worse, Kimye couldn’t care less about Swift’s vengeful new video. An insider says, They’ve moved on.

Katy ducked out from introducing Taylor's new single  "Look What You Made Me Do " Sunday during MTV's award show ... managing to steer clear of any mention of Taylor once it ended.  The show came out of commercial and went right into Taylor's video with just a generic PSA on the monitors at the Forum. Afterward,  "Blackish " star Yara Shahidi came onstage to introduce a performance for Shawn Mendes.  Through it all  ... Katy made herself scarce. Seems like the honchos over at MTV were fully aware of how awkward it woulda been having Katy pitch the video premiere of her longtime pop foe ... with whom she hasn't officially buried the hatchet. Taylor wasn't in the house Sunday ... she won Best Collaboration for her song with Zayn Malik, but neither came up to accept their award.  As for her video ... well, it sorta speaks for itself. Check it, Kanye./nHERE'S THE RUNDOWN   Malia Obama Harassed At Harvard Taylor Swift: Waging War With Kim & Kanye Actor's Insane Meltdown On Plane  Kevin Hart Shames Celebs For Hurricane Harvey Relief/nTaylor Swift's new music video wasn't the only thing worth looking at during last night's MTV Video Music Awards ... check out what was going down backstage. Rappers were hanging out with pop stars ... Katy Perry was doing crazy costume changes and Ellen was posing for pics with EVERYBODY! The award show itself didn't have any angry Kanye interruptions or Britney Spears dancing with a snake -- but there was still plenty of action behind the scenes at the moon man ceremony./nThe MTV Awards were a big hit Sunday night with celebs who eyeballed it at The Forum ... to a person they had high praise. We got Jared Leto, Mel B, Heidi Klum, Post Malone, Joe Jonas, Shawn Mendes, Nina Dobrev and Jessie J at the Republic Records and Cadillac party at TAO after the ceremony. They gushed over the show. BTW ... some of them were mum on Taylor Swift's music video. It's kinda like ... do you really want to cross Kim and Kanye?/n "Straight Outta Compton " actor R. Marcos Taylor -- who played Suge Knight in the flick -- allegedly went on a rampage at a New Jersey bank, threatening to kill employees and lunging at police. Cops say they were called to a TD Bank August 8 to handle an enraged Taylor. We're told the actor had an issue with a bank card and needed a new one, and he was hostile from the get-go. A witness tells us Taylor threatened an employee, saying,  "I will f***ing kill you. " Cops say when they arrived, Taylor squared off in a fighting stance so they pepper sprayed and then arrested him.  Taylor was charged with terroristic threats, obstruction of justice and disorderly conduct. It's been a rough month for the actor. TMZ broke the story ... he was arrested August 9 for assault after allegedly attacking employees at an Italian restaurant. He claims they were the aggressors. /nIt's not news Taylor Swift and Kanye West dislike each other, but the timing of her new album release takes it to a whole new level. Taylor's album,  "Reputation, " is set to drop November 10, exactly 10 years to the day Donda West died from complications from cosmetic surgery. Donda was everything to Kanye and her death shattered him for years. In fact, his breakdown last year coincided with the death anniversary. In fairness, November 10 is a Friday ... the preferred day to drop albums. In fact, a source at Taylor's label tells us they picked the date  "based on other Universal Music Group releases. There is no correlation. " Nonetheless, Donda's death was such a big deal it's hard to forget, especially if you're feuding with her son.   TMZ broke the story ... when Kanye released  "Famous " with the lyric,  "I made that bitch famous " -- referring to Taylor -- she claimed he didn't give her a heads-up, but turns out Kanye recorded her saying just that./nTaylor Swift's new song,  "Look What You Made Me Do, " isn't a jab at Katy Perry, it's meant purely for Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. Taylor dropped her first single off her upcoming  "Reputation " album Thursday night and called out Kanye in the opening verse, where she sings  "I don't like your little games ... don't like your tilted stage. "  Our sources tell us the song is definitely targeting the Wests, who Taylor feels betrayed her by releasing their now infamous phone convo. Taylor's side of the story has always been ... they discussed the lyric but she never approved Kanye calling her  "bitch " in  "Famous. " We're told Taylor feels she was backstabbed by the couple and there will be more not-so-subtle hints in the official music video, which will debut Sunday during the VMAs.  Taylor released a short clip that zooms in on her sitting on a throne ... with the inscription,  "et tu, brute. " When the disses turn Shakespearean ... you know it's serious.  It's a famous line from Shakespeare's play  "Julius Caesar " when Caesar is being stabbed to death and recognizes one of his pals, Brutus, is in on it. The phrase is now meant to symbolize backstabbing. Taylor still played it safe for the video. She could've gone with  "Et tu, Kimye? "/nHERE'S THE RUNDOWN   Kylie Jenner's Nude Photo Shoot  D.L. Hughley: America's Civil War Usher On Herpes Lawsuit: You Have No Proof! Dave Chappelle's Birthday Wish!/nTaylor Swift may be sorely disappointed at the VMAs Sunday, because she's gonna have no one to glare at ... we've learned Kim and Kanye are otherwise engaged. It would have been pretty epic ... Taylor showing off  "Look What You Made Me Do " as she stares down the royal couple, but we're told long before the single was released they decided the VMAs were not for them. They're in town, but we're told there's no particular reason for them to trek to The Forum near LAX. It's actually kinda brilliant ... Kim and Kanye become the center of attention at the music event, courtesy of Taylor Swift, and they don't have to lift a finger./nLooks like Taylor Swift and Katy Perry's bad blood has finally been mopped up -- 'cause Taylor's new album throws no shade her way ... like, AT ALL. Our sources tell us TayTay's 6th album,  "Reputation, " is devoid of hate or trash talking directed at her longtime foe. Anyone expecting another epic slash at Katy is going to be sorely disappointed. On the surface it seems as if Taylor is taking a swipe at Katy. In her new song,  "Look What You Made Me Do, " Taylor sings,  "I've got a list of names and yours is in red underlined. " It appears she's making reference to the movie  "Mean Girls, " where Regina George's picture is in the burn book with the words,  "She is a fugly slut " and underlined in red.  Katy raised the issue in a tweet directed at Taylor back in 2014 ...  Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing... — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) September 9, 2014  Our sources say Taylor's album lyrics have nothing to do with  "Mean Girls, " Regina George or Katy. Katy has recently said she wants to end her feud, so now it's all on Taylor. The mystery ... we're told something big will happen at the VMAs ... and reading between the lines it would not be surprising if Katy and Taylor appear onstage and publicly bury the hatchet. It makes sense ... Taylor will probably dig that hatchet right back up and go after Kim and Kanye./nTaylor Swift fans got duped hard into thinking she was following up her record-breaking single and music vid debut with a live performance, but someone pulled a fast one ... TMZ has learned. Fans thought Taylor was appearing on 'GMA' Thursday morning due to a DIRECTV search of her name which brought up 2 movies and 'GMA.' Yes, Taylor was in the 'Hannah Montana' movie and 'The Lorax' -- but NO, she will absolutely not be on ABC Friday morning.  Our sources at the network say Taylor's not scheduled to perform or sit down for an interview. It's unclear why 'GMA' was included in the search results, but feel free to adjust your DVRs. We're guessing she'll pop up somewhere soon though when and if  "Look What You Made Me Do " hits #1, as it's expected to do./nIt's now obvious Taylor Swift's been sharpening her lyrical knives during her hiatus -- she whipped 'em out for Katy Perry AND Kanye West in her new track,  "Look What You Made Me Do. "  Tay Tay just dropped a music video for the track, and the lyrics leave no doubt who she's attacking. She sings,  "I don't like your little games ... don't like your tilted stage " in the opening verse -- a clear reference to Kanye's last tour. Taylor also clearly refers to 'Ye calling her a bitch in,  "Famous " --  "The role you made me play of the fool ... no, I don't like you. " The 2nd verse seems to be targeting Katy for their feud over tour dancers -- and she plays off those snake teasers she's been posting. They're all over the animated music vid. The track is dripping with revenge shots like ...  "Maybe I got mine, but one day you'll get yours " and  "I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined. " It's always the quiet ones./nKanye West looked a tad pensive as he left his offices Friday, after the announcement that Taylor Swift's new album will be released on the 10-year-anniversary of his mom's death.   As you know, Taylor furor in the song,  "Look What You Made Me Do " is aimed at Kanye and Kim. Kanye's sporting a t with the words,  "my bloody Valentine " emblazoned on the front.  Unclear what that means. As we reported, Kayne and Kim will not go to the VMA's Sunday, where Taylor is going to make an appearance./nTaylor Swift is in a one-way feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Taylor has put Kim and Kanye in her crosshairs in her new single,  "Look What You Made Me Do, " comparing them in the music video to Brutus who backstabbed Julius Caesar. Our Kim and Kanye sources say their well-publicized feud -- triggered by Kanye's song  "Famous " in which he referenced Taylor with the lyric,  "I made that bitch famous " -- is old and buried.  As for Kanye, our sources say there are certain feuds he deeply cares about ... like the one in which he's embroiled with Jay-Z and Tidal. As one well-connected source put it,  "They're like brothers who fight but feel bad about it and always end up coming together. " Taylor, on the other hand, isn't even on his radar. As for Kim, we're told the way she sees it, the whole feud ended over a year ago. However, if Swift wants her album to resonate, what better way to do it than pick a fight with one of the most famous duos in the world.
