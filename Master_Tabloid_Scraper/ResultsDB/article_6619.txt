"Heart Broken" Michelle Releases Statement/nTen days after the death of Heath Ledger, former fianceé and baby mama Michelle Williams released a statement. It reads:  "Please respect our need to grieve privately. My heart is broken. I am the mother of the most tender-hearted, high-spirited, beautiful little girl who is the spitting image of her father. All that I can cling to is his presence inside her that reveals itself every day. His family and I watch Matilda as she whispers to trees, hugs animals, and takes steps two at a time and we know that he is with us still. She will be brought up with the best memories of him. "/n
