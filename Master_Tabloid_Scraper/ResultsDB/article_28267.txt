But Evans alleged exclusively to Radar that she is the one who contacted him regarding their son. “Nathan is upset because I simply asked him and his mother if Kaiser has been spanked this past weekend,” she said. “Nathan claimed no, but then claimed, ‘I’ll spank him if and when I want cause I’m his father.” She continued that she is “highly against” physical punishment and that she will be speaking to her lawyer.12 of 12    my joy❤️ A post shared by Nathan Joseph Griffith (@nathanjgriffith) on Mar 28, 2017 at 4:37pm PDT
