Michael Avedon for Harper's BAZAAR

The name Emma Ferrer may not ring any bells, but you definitely know her very famous grandmother: Audrey Hepburn.Ferrer graces the cover of Harper's Bazaar's subscription September issue (Lady Gaga is on the newsstand version), and this is not only the 20-year-old's first cover, but it's her first ever magazine photo shoot. Um, that's a pretty sweet first gig right out the gate.Audrey Hepburn was the muse of iconic photographer Richard Avedon, so for Emma's modeling debut Avedon's grandson Michael Avedon photographed the cover.

Emma definitely looks strikingly like her grandmother—the dark hair, flawless complexion and those famous cheekbones. Take a look at our split below of Emma and Audrey. Uncanny, right? And the vibe of the cover is very Old Hollywood.In the issue, Emma opens up about being related to someone as legendary as Audrey Hepburn. "When I watched Breakfast at Tiffany's, I enjoyed it the same way any young girl would," she said. "I've seen My Fair Lady and Roman Holiday, but I suppose my favorite is Funny Face."

And while everyone loves getting vintage hand-me-downs from their grandmothers, it's especially cool in Emma's case. So does she have anything of Audrey's? "All I can think of are her cashmere turtlenecks, which I adore and wear all throughout the winter," she says. "And a white antique stuffed teddy bear."Pick up a copy of Bazaar out on newsstands Aug. 19, and for more on Emma Ferrer, check out the full interview.
