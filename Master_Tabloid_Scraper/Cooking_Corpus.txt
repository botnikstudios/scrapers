See Queen Elizabeth Enjoying Life on Malta in Early Years of Marriage/n
With a broad smile and in the arms of her naval officer husband Prince Philip, the then Princess Elizabeth was having the time of her (married) life.  
Dancing together at the Union Club Sliema, Malta on a night in December 1950, Elizabeth, 24, looked into the eyes of her dashing blond husband as they partied on the Mediterranean island.  
She and Philip spent around two years from 1949-1951 living at the Villa Guardamangia in Valletta while he was based there in the navy.

This weekend, they have returned to the tiny island (with Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall) for the meeting of the heads of government from across the Commonwealth, the band of nations that have historic links with Britain, or have the Queen as head of state.  
The time the couple spent largely on Malta was, biographer Ben Pimlott has noted, the “most ‘normal’ of her entire life.” Their then private secretary Mike Parker said it was a “fabulous period.”  
Hector Borg Carbott
It was, Pimlott writes in The Queen, a “haven of comparative privacy and freedom from official duties.” She was happy playing at being a service wife (albeit one with a retinue of servants) while she left her son, Prince Charles, then 1, in the charge of the royal nursery and his maternal grandparents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, back in Sandringham at Christmas time.

She announced she was pregnant with daughter Princess Anne while there, in April 1950, and headed home to Clarence House in order to give birth in August that year.  
These pictures, taken by Hector Borg Carbott, a former Royal Air Force photographer, give a glimpse of how life looked – and underline what a special place it is for Elizabeth, now 89.

Ten years ago, the Queen praised the “outgoing, generous Maltese people who have always offered us the hand of friendship,” and the couple has frequently visited, sometimes bringing son Charles (in 1954), while Prince William underlined the family’s connections by visiting in September last year to mark the island’s 50th anniversary of independence.

It was a girl for Kerry Washington!The Scandal star gave birth nearly two weeks ago and her team of real-life gladiators managed to successfully keep that information under wraps until today, upon the public availability of the child's birth certificate.The document, obtained by E! News, shows that Isabelle Amarachi Asomugha was born April 21 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Washington's husband of nearly a year, Nnamdi Asomugha, signed off as the father on April 29 and the attendant who served as a legal witness to the birth signed on April 24.

Hey, everyone involved was probably a little too busy to think about signing papers right away, you know?The baby girl's middle name, Amarachi, is an African word meaning "God's grace," a rather beautiful complement to Isabelle, which means "devoted to God."

E! News confirmed in October that Washington and Asomugha were expecting their first child together, but the 37-year-old actress didn't really talk about her pregnancy until she hit the Golden Globes red carpet with a baby bump."I also feel like I have the best date of the night, my little accessory here," she told E! News, gesturing to her belly.And as her adorable accessory grew on her, Washington continued to wear it well. "I work very physically as an actor," she told The Hollywood Reporter last month. "The biggest thing for me has been the challenge of how to be this person [Scandal's Olivia Pope] with the personal transformation that's going on for me physically and how to stay true to this character. That hasn't been easy."—Reporting by Claudia Rosenbaum

Instead of her usual big name designer frocks, the pregnant Duchess stepped out in a pretty polka dot dress by ASOS, which retails for approximately $65 USD. Middleton, who spent the morning meeting families aided by the charity Home-Start, finished off her chic casual look with black pumps, a matching clutch and black jacket.
According to the Daily Mail, a charity volunteer spoke with the Duchess about her due date next month.
“I’m due mid-April, to the end of April,” the pregnant royal said. “Not long to go now.”
This is the first time Middleton has spoken about her due date in public since Kensington Palace issued an official statement on her pregnancy last October.
This will be the second child for the Duchess and her husband, the Duke of Cambridge (Prince William). The Cambridges are already proud parents to Prince George, who will turn 2 years old this July.

Get to Know: Idris Elba/n





                    #MCM: 10 Reasons Why We Love Idris Elba So Much
                







Idris Elba is, without a doubt the man of the moment.

 MORE >>





Soon Idris Elba will be headlining a massive franchise opposite Matthew McConaughey from Stephen King. But first, let’s review where this soon-to-be A-lister came from.

In midst of the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, actor Idris Elba’s performance in Beasts of No Nation took centerstage. It was one of several roles (including Michael B. Jordan’s in Creed) that many felt were passed over by the Academy Awards. Well, regardless of the snubs, the British actor’s career is soaring and it feels like a good time to look back at where he came from, and where he’s headed…
After dropping out of school at age 16, Elba began working odd jobs and auditioning for film and TV roles, landing his first gig doing murder reconstructions on Crimewatch, a British television show that investigates unsolved crimes. But his real break came in 2002. The then-thirty-year-old found himself in a leading role on HBO’s The Wire, portraying Stringer Bell, a complex, charismatic drug lord in Baltimore, Md. Elba embodied a street hustler who was cleverly outsmarting the law but ultimately struggled to leave a life of crime behind.
Now that American audiences knew the actor, the floodgates opened. Elba appeared in The Big C, Thor and Pacific Rim. For a brief period, he played Michael Scott’s (Steve Carell) replacement on The Office, the no-nonsense manager Charles Miner. His stern reactions to Scott’s hilarious behavior (as well as his popularity among his female subordinates) is a highlight of the series.





Next came the titular role in BBC’s Luthor, a gritty crime thriller about an obsessive cop and the unlikely bond he forms with a serial killer he’s chasing. The role demanded a sometimes explosive, sometimes subdued performance from Elba, who delivered a complexity that is entirely his own.





If his previous dramatic turns didn’t prove just how dark (and engrossing) Elba could venture, his next role would rid the critics of any doubt. He portrayed the Commandant in Cary Joji Fukunaga’s film, Beasts of No Nation, an examination of child soldiers in an African country. Elba is as charismatic as he is hypnotizing, inspiring young boys to fight in a war they don’t understand. Although he didn’t get the Oscar nomination he deserved, the press for his performance and the subsequent awards snub only heightened his profile.





In April, Disney’s Jungle Book will hit theaters featuring the English actor as the villain of Rudyard Kipling’s story, Shere Khan. Depicted as a fearsome tiger, Khan is arrogant and imposing, believing himself to be the true king of the jungle. Elba joins voice-actors Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Christopher Walken and Ben Kingsley in the film live-action version of the classic story.





So, what’s next for Idris Elba? Universal exposure. He’ll be lending his baritone and his powerful presence to the third installment of the Star Trek franchise as the gruesome Krall, an alien looking to upend the Federation’s status quo. And if that isn’t cool enough, prepare for Elba to headline the biggest franchise of Stephen King’s career, The Dark Tower series. Think Lord of the Rings meets an epic western. This could be as big as Harry Potter with Idris as the star, playing the The Gunslinger.
Hopefully this inspired you to dig a little deeper with that one actor from The Wire you loved, or that terrifying guy from Beasts of No Nation. His name is Idris Elba. Get used to hearing it.

“We will be expecting our third little Romo offspring this August,” she announced on KTCK 96.7 FM/1310 AM The Ticket.
In June, the then-family of four shared images from a stunning maternity shoot exclusively with PEOPLE — in which everyone wore blue, of course!
“I felt a lot sicker during this pregnancy, and so we thought that it may be because there was a little girl inside, but we were definitely wrong,” Crawford Romo, 30, told PEOPLE at the time.

“Sure, it would have been new and different to have a little girl running around, but we love our boys and I love being a “boy mom,” so adding one more to the mix is exciting,” she said. “The best part about being a boy mom is that they keep me active! Whether it’s sword fighting or playing basketball, we are constantly on the go.”
Does her newest son’s arrival mean the family will try again for a little girl? “I think we are done after this third little guy arrives. You never say never, but I’m fairly confident that once this baby is out, we’ll feel like the Romo family is complete,” Crawford Romo added in June.

Home Video Sheds Insight on Jackson Family /nFor those curious about the kind of home Michael Jackson's kids would grow up in under Katherine and Joe, some never-before-seen video of the family may be the best glimpse.The more than 40-hours of footage -- showing Joe with several grandchildren in their Hayvenhurst home months before Michael's death -- is the only known video showcasing them living as a family. Joe can be seen repeatedly praising the kids -- at one point even telling granddaughter Genevieve she could have a potential singing career because  "You have the talent. You are a Jackson. "Joe also speaks pointedly about Michael, saying no one but the family truly knows the kind of gentle spirit he is, saying  "Anybody in pain, you see tears coming from (Michael's) eyes. "The production company, Xonger Global Entertainment Network, is working with Beverly Hills talent agency APA to license the footage -- originally filmed in hopes of making a reality show. So far, ABC is the only network to license any of the footage./n

Sing it, sister!Demi Lovato belted out a crowd-stirring performance of the National Anthem for the packed house at the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight at the Las Vegas T-Mobile Arena in Nevada on Saturday night. Both the cheering crowd at the arena and the Internet have spoken—Demi was a hit! For the show-stopping (or starting, rather) number, the big-voiced singer opted for a plunging white ensemble, fitted with a golden belt to sing ahead of the "fight of the century."William H. Macy, Vanessa Hudgens, Sharon Osbourne, Ozzy Osbourne, LeBron James, Isaiah Thomas, Mike Tyson, Michael Rapaport, Jay Pharoah, Nick Jonas, Orlando Bloom and a slew of other celebs have turned up for fight night.According to Rolling Stone, this is the first time that the 25-year-old, a huge fan of MMA, will have sung the "Star-Spangled Banner" at a boxing event. However, this isn't the first time that the "Skyscraper" songstress has kicked off a sporting game with her big vocals. She's also sung at the National Anthem at Game 4 of the 2015 World Series, Game 5 of the 2011 World Series, and a 2008 Dallas Cowboys game.

Before taking to the ring, the "Sorry Not Sorry" singer revealed to MTV that she was nervous about singing the "Star-Spangled Banner" before the big fight. She told MTV, "I feel so nervous but I’m really, really excited! This is the biggest fight of our generation! So when you look at it that way and how many fans all over the world are going to be watching, it’s nerve wracking for sure."But as for which fighter she's picking? "I don’t have a favorite. I am not picking sides! I am there to unite the audience of the fight. I’m there to be a voice."

Tonight's performance is just one stop on a weekend chock full of singing appearances. The "Confident" took to Twitter earlier this week to announce she'd be performing at the 2017 MTV VMAs in Inglewood.Demi's new album Tell Me You Love Me drops Sept. 29.

Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are ready to share the sex of their first baby together with the public.

The couple reveals that they are expecting a baby boy in a new interview with Us Weekly.
“I ran into the room and said, ‘It’s the doctor’s office!’” Montag recalls in this week’s issue of Us Weekly. “The doctor said, ‘It’s a boy!’ I started screaming.”
Montag, who is currently 17 weeks along in her pregnancy, says, “It was in my heart to have a boy.”
“I thought Spencer really used to want a boy, and then a few months ago we had a conversation where he said, ‘Let’s just make sure it’s healthy. Boy or girl, I don’t care.'”
Montag says that she hoped that their child would be a boy because, according to her, it would allow for a “more natural bond for Spencer” since he and his father have a tight relationship. She suspects that Pratt and their child will be doing jujitsu and playing soccer often.

Amazing Tale Of Dog Who Survived 100 Ft Fall And Found Way Back To Vacation Home/n
By Radar Staff
Now, this is quite the shaggy dog tale!
Bella, a gorgeous black lab, proved a dog’s innate homing instinct is second to none after surviving a 100 foot fall off a cliff and then finding her way back to the vacation home, a mile away, that she had only been to once before, a year earlier.
Bella’s incredible journey began after she fell off a cliff in Dorset, England as she chased a seagull while out on a walk with her owner, Chris Sexton.
PHOTOS: Puppy Love: Stars and Their Dogs
The MailOnline reports  that Sexton spent a desperate 30 minutes searching for his beloved pooch before his wife called to say she had arrived back home safe and sound.
“She is only 15 months old. I walked her down to the cliffs from the holiday home last summer but i would never have thought she would of remembered the route,” Sexton said.

“I have no idea how she survived the fall, got back up the cliff and then found her way back home by herself. It is quite amazing.”
Chris went on to explain his horror at watching the lab fall over the cliff.
“She just went for it and then went over the edge with her legs splayed out.
PHOTOS: Favorite TV Dogs
“I thought it was the end of her and I looked over the edge and thought I could see her on the beach but didn’t know if she was alive or dead.
“When I got down there, there was no sign of her. I called and whistled for her but nothing. After about ten minutes I called my wife Jo who was back at the flat to tell her what happened.
Then I got a call back about twenty minutes later saying Bella had arrived back safely. She was fine.”

Susan Sarandon Blasts Woody Allen At Cannes Over Sexual Abuse Allegations — See What She Said HERE!/n

Susan Sarandon is NOT a Woody Allen fan.
On Sunday, The Meddler actress told the world how she really feels about the controversial director during Variety and Kering's Women in Motion sit down with her Thelma & Louise costar Geena Davis at the Cannes Film Festival. Whoa.
Related: Woody Reportedly Bans THR From Cannes Event
The 69-year-old shared: 

"I think he sexually assaulted a child and I don't think that's right."
Oh snap! As you may know, the Oscar winning filmmaker has been at the center of attention at the film festival after a French comedian Laurent Lafitte made Allen the center of a rape joke at the opening ceremony of Cannes — days after his son Ronan Farrow penned an essay where he commented on the abuse his father allegedly inflicted on his sister Dylan.
Intense stuff.
While Susan was not afraid to speak her mind about her thoughts on Woody, it appears she didn't want to waste much time on the matter. Miz Sarandon added:

"I have nothing good to say about him. I don't want to go there."
Well, well. The Rocky Horror Picture Show alum has never been one to keep her opinions to herself, but it'll certainly be inneresting to see if Mr. Allen claps back at the A-lister with a response.

Divorce, Drugs & Deceit! Steve Harvey's Darkest Secrets Exposed/n
Steve Harvey failed to cough up child support — after ditching his first wife while she was pregnant, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively. The bombshell claim comes from never-before-seen divorce papers obtained by Radar — and which tell the lurid tale of Harvey’s shady breakup from his first wife, Marcia.
READ THE DIVORCE PAPERS HERE 
“This is the secret Steve hoped the world would never know!” an insider tell us. “His behavior toward Marcia and his family was worse than despicable!”
The couple married in 1981 — and although Marcia did not file for divorce until 1993, the documents show she listed the date of separation as August of 1990.
Shockingly, that time frame would be eight months before scandal-prone Harvey‘s first-born son — and namesake — Broderick Jr. was born! The sullied entertainer’s real name is Broderick Stephen Harvey.
A source familiar with the sensational documents told Radar: “From the date Marcia listed, it’s reasonable to surmise Steve walked out on his pregnant wife and a family that also, at that point, included twin daughters Brandi and Karli.”
PHOTOS: Tarek And Christina El Moussa Make First Public Appearance Since Divorce Scandal
In the explosive legal papers, Marcia also accused Steve — now worth over $140 million — of stiffing her and his children despite earning over $1 million a year from the sitcom “Me and the Boys.” She claimed: “Defendant has given the Plaintiff an amount far less than is necessary to provide the bare necessities for her family.”
In April 1994, Steve was ordered to pay Marcia $5,100 a month in support payments, plus her legal fees.
But 14 months later Marcia submitted an affidavit to the court claiming she hadn’t gotten one red cent.
In the June 1995 document Marcia stated: “As of this date, I have not received any payment whatsoever from defendant Wonderlove Inc. or from Defendant Steve Harvey.”
READ THE AFFIDAVIT HERE 
That same document also asked the court to find Steve in contempt for failing to pay the support money.
Later that same year, a court ruled Steve owed his by-then ex-wife Marcia $36,000 in late support payments and raised his support payments to $6,630 a month.
The divorce papers also named Steve’s second wife, Mary Shackelford. The two started living together before he was divorced from Marcia — a pattern he seemingly continued after leaving Mary and taking up with the woman who would eventually become his third wife, Marjorie.
In fact, after Mary and Steve split, she accused him of bigamy, claiming he was still legally married to her when he wed Marjorie in 2007!
But Steve’s scofflaw and deadbeat dad past is only the tip of the legal iceberg.
PHOTOS: Angelina Jolie Takes Shiloh Christmas Shopping Amid Divorce Crisis
In another scandalous exclusive, Radar has learned the sordid host, 60, is tied to two drug smuggling rings through his current wife, Marjorie.
The FBI and DEA began investigating Marjorie while she was married to drug lord Jim L. Townsend, 68.
Documents reviewed by Radar reveal the two agencies suspected Marjorie played a role in the drug ring, and told Townsend that “his wife would be arrested, as the agents believed they had substantial evidence of her own illegal activities” if he didn’t cooperate.
Townsend was eventually indicted for attempting to buy 40 kilos of cocaine and sentenced to life in prison. He served 26 years and was released in January 2017 after being granted a pardon by then-President Barack Obama.
Marjorie split from Townsend less than five years into his sentence, but quickly got involved with ANOTHER drug kingpin, Donnell Woods.
He fathered her third child, daughter Lori, in 1997, and they married in 2000 — around the time the FBI started to investigate Woods for his role in a drug smuggling operation.

New Girl’s New Guy: Lamorne Morris Replaces Damon Wayans, Jr./n
By Neil WoulfeRadar Senior News Director
It isn’t exactly on the level of when they switched Durwoods (sorry, Darrins) on us during the sixth season of Bewitched, but still…
Fans of the new Fox sitcom New Girl, starring Zooey Deschanel, may have been surprised Tuesday night when Damon Wayans, Jr. was suddenly gone after only one episode and replaced by Lamorne Morris.
TV insiders knew the change was coming, but in case you didn’t, here’s the inside scoop.
PHOTOS: Couples We’d Like To See!
On the pilot for New Girl, the very funny Wayans played Coach, one of Zooey’s three male roommates she meets on Craigslist after breaking up with her cheating boyfriend. The problem was — Wayans was also committed to ABC’s Happy Endings, which was recently picked up for a second season after he shot the pilot for New Girl.
Wayans had taped the entire 13-episode first season of Happy Endings — which also stars Elisha Cuthbert, Casey Wilson, Eliza Coupe, Zachary Knighton, and Adam Pally — but the show waited and waited for a premiere date. Meanwhile, not knowing if Happy Endings had a future, Wayans got cast in the New Girl pilot.
PHOTOS: Stars Without Make-up 
When the first season of Happy Endings finally aired last spring, it was a surprise hit and a second season was ordered.
The only problem —  the pilot for New Girl was well received, too, and a first season was ordered by Fox.
“Happy Endings was the first TV show I ever auditioned for, and New Girl was my second,” Wayans, 29, told the Toronto Sun. “So I didn’t really know the protocol.
PHOTOS: Stars Who Look Like Other Stars 
“But I was contractually obligated to Happy Endings. So no matter what, if Happy Endings got picked up, that’s where I was going to be.”
The creators of New Girl liked the pilot so much that they decided to leave Wayans in it for the premiere episode.
Rather than recast and reshoot the pilot, Morris joined New Girl in its second episode. Morris plays Winston, a competitive former athlete who has realized he’ll never go pro and moves into the loft shared with the hilarious Max Greenfield and Jake Johnson, as well as the lovely Deschanel.
PHOTOS: A-Listers Before They Were Stars
As for Wayans, he told the Toronto Sun, he’s focused now on Happy Endings.
“Our show has very current jokes, it’s a very youthful comedy,” Wayans said. “And on top of that we’re allowed to improvise so much.
PHOTOS: The Name Game – Celebs Who’ve Changed Their Names
“So basically you just mix that together and you get the feeling of it being a little raw when you watch it. You don’t really know where the laugh is going to come from.”
Happy Endings kicks off its second season Wednesday, Sept. 28 on ABC; New Girl airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on Fox.
 
This is the pilot featuring Damon Wayans, Jr.

Viola Davis Looks Positively Bridal Alongside Husband Julius Tennon On The SAG Awards Red Carpet/n

Here comes the SAG Awards winner!
Before taking home the award for Supporting Actress, Viola Davis posed alongside her husband Julius Tennon on the red carpet.
We did not like her bridal inspired look paired with a busy Nirav Modi necklace and black Tyler Ellis clutch. Her glam was also a bit harsh.
Julius looked fine in a black suit. Overall, the pairing was underwhelming.
She's known for better, so hopefully Viola STUNS at the Oscars.

 EXCLUSIVE VIDEO INTERVIEW: Randy Jackson Gives Props To 'X Factor' -- 'It's Going To Be.../n
RadarOnline.com caught up with American Idol judge Randy Jackson Thursday, and in an exclusive video interview, he gave props to Simon Cowell‘s upcoming X-Factor, saying: “I’m sure it’s going to be a hot show!”
“Simon will always do fine,” Randy told RadarOnline.com of his ex-Idol colleague. “He’s a very smart and talented guy. I’m sure it’s going to be a hot show as well. He’s my dear friend, we love him. What’s up Simon?”

We spotted America’s favorite “dawg” lunching with Chef Lorena Garcia at The Grove in Los Angeles. Randy also told RadarOnline.com that the addition of new judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler on this season of American Idol is: “coming along good and it’s a good mix.”
Randy would not reveal who he thinks will take home the title this season, but he did jokingly predict that “somebody with hair is going to win.”

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Pia Toscano and Stefano Langone were among the clear standouts on Wednesday’s edition of the hit Fox show, as each delivered rousing performances on a night the 12 remaining contestants had to perform songs released the year they were born.
Stefano  — a wild card contestant  — delivered a powerful performance of Simply Red’s 1989 ballad If You Don’t Know Me By Now. His set was lauded by Randy, who said the 22-year-old Kent, Washington native “took a song with the highest degree of difficulty and slayed it.”
On Thursday night’s ‘Results Show’, Stefano and Pia were both safe from the get-go, but Naima, Hailey, and Karen were all in the bottom three — eventually Karen was sent home.

Farrah Abraham Is “Done” with Simon Saran/n

Simon Saran is spilling intimate details about his relationship with Farrah Abraham.

Farrah Abraham is over on-and-off boyfriend Simon Saran.

The Teen Mom OG publicly dragged the realtor when Simon called her “fake” and claimed he doesn’t “have time for child play sh*t anymore.” Responding to his barrage of hateful tweets, Farrah accused Simon of being “jealous” and a “fame whore.”
Via Teen Mom Talk Now:
That’s when Simon decided to just go for the throat and explained that Farrah isn’t really living her life for her, it’s always about what MTV wants. He said, “Farrah doesn’t know what she wants. She should be home with Sophia. Instead she’s dating fame whore d**kheads. Gets old. Her producers needed her to play single. Being a slave to money you hurt people along the way. So I threw up the [peace sign]. Farrah is a slave to MTV. What they say goes.”
Farrah was not happy about what he said about her parenting skills, and replied, “Simon Saran why are you trying to get attention, your pathetic & I’m a great mother, professional, friend & women go STOP using me for money.”

 ANOTHER Development In Diana 'Murder' Mystery, As Author Claims Princess Killed.../n
Princess Diana was expectant with Dodi Fayed‘s unborn child at the time the two died in an auto accident in Paris, the author of a new book claims, adding that the pregnancy “established a motive for murder” that was carried out by Britain’s SAS, to avoid the fallout of a scandal of having a child out of wedlock.
Alan Power, author of The Princess Diana Conspiracy, writes that Dr. Elizabeth Dion and a nurse Jocelyn Magellan at Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris saw the late princess had a six-to-10-week-old fetus in her womb. Power, according to the UK Daily Star, said the budding pregnancy “established a motive for murder and explained Diana’s illegal and speedy embalming.”
PHOTOS: Princess Diana Through The Years
The pregnancy theory was floated during the 2007 inquest into Di’s death, though Powers said “this evidence [of the nurse and doctor] was not available in court, although available to some others.”
The report furthers a budding conspiracy set forth after a troop identified as Solider N told his wife the 36-year-old princess was clandestinely assassinated in the Aug. 1997 auto accident in Paris after a special forces team blinded the car’s driver, Henri Paul, with a searing laser. /n

ESPN: Announcer Robert Lee Was Pulled to Avoid ‘Social Hectoring and Trolling’/n
ESPN president John Skipper has explained that the decision to remove Robert Lee as an announcer from Tuesday night’s football game was not because network bosses were worried about offending people.
Skipper sent an internal memo on Wednesday night, later obtained by CNN, which said: “There was never any concern — by anyone, at any level — that Robert Lee’s name would offend anyone watching the Charlottesville game.
“Among our Charlotte production staff there was a question as to whether — in these divisive times — Robert’s assignment might create a distraction, or even worse, expose him to social hectoring and trolling.”

— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) August 24, 2017

Lee was supposed to announce the University of Virginia’s home opener football game, but was switched to announce Youngstown State University pit against the University of Pittsburgh instead. The move comes after violence broke out at a white nationalist rally in Virginia.
One person died after being run over at the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The white nationalist groups were originally protesting plans to remove the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
Skipper added that Lee had some hesitation himself about announcing the Virginia game and opted for the Youngstown State/Pitt game when offered.

Chester Bennington Bought His Family a House Just Months Before Suicide/n





                    Inside Chester Bennington's Final Days
                







"I can either just give up and f**king die or I can fight," said the late singer in his final interview.

Those closest to Chester Bennington believe the singer had no intention of killing himself.

The Linkin Park frontman had big plans before his suicide, including moving his family to the California home where he tragically took his life. The late 41-year-old reportedly splashed out $2.5 million on the five-bedroom, four-bathroom house at Palos Verdes Estates just two months before his death, sparking speculation among his loved ones that something else must’ve triggered his depression instead.
Via TMZ:
The purchase falls in line with what Chester’s LP bandmates said — that he’d spoken excitedly about future plans. Buying the perfect place for his family, but then taking his life there a month later just doesn’t add up.
The Benningtons closed on the house 8 days after Chris Cornell’s suicide … leading some close friends to believe Chester’s suicide decision was sudden and fueled by his grief.

 Day Of Terror: Nearly 50 People Dead In 3 Attacks In France, Tunisia & Kuwait ––.../n
Terror ran rampant worldwide Friday, as three shocking attacks across the globe — in Tunisia, Kuwait and France — led to more than 50 deaths.
Terror In Tunisia
Two gunmen went on a shooting spree at a beach in Tunisia, killing 27 people, the country’s Interior Ministry spokesman Mohammed Ali Aroui confirmed on Friday. The rampage occurred on a beach resort in Sousse, in between the Soviva and Imperial Marhaba hotels. One of the murderers was killed by security troops who responded to the shooting spree, while another escaped the area. Gary Pine, a tourist in the area from England, said that “there was a mass exodus off the beach” after the gunmen began spraying bullets at the helpless masses. While officials had not yet confirmed the names and identities of all of the victims, most of them were believed to be foreigners, as the holy Muslim month of Ramadan meant that a lot of Muslim Tunisians were not on the shore, the AP reported. An attack at a Tunisian museum in March left 21 tourists, and one native, dead.

16 Dead, 179 Injured In Kuwait
ISIS claimed responsibility for an explosive ambush on a Kuwait City mosque for Shiite Muslims that left at least 16 people dead and 179 people injured, the AP reported. The attacks occurred as a group composed of mostly men and boys were worshipping in the Imam Sadiq Mosque. Among the dead included a human rights activist, and the Kuwait Watch Organization said more were missing in the wake of the attack. ISIS said on a Twitter post that a suicide bomber pulled off the deadly attack using a belt rigged with explosives. Eyewitness Hassan al-Haddad described the immediate relief efforts in the wake of the deadly blast: “We couldn’t see anything, so we went straight to the wounded and tried to carry them out — we left the dead.” ISIS stands in conflict with Shiite Muslims, claiming the ambush took place on a “temple of the apostates.”

Man Decapitated In Attack On French Factory
A suspect in an explosive attack on a French factory was identified by police as Yassine Salhi, who lives in Saint-Priest. Two people, one believed to Salhi’s wife, were taken into custody from their home by officials after Salhi smashed a car into canisters of gas at the Air Products factory, which triggered an explosion. A French businessman in the transportation industry was found decapitated outside the facility, security officials in France said, adding that the victim was likely slaughtered prior to the crash. Two Arabic banners were recovered near the man’s remains. “People who could have participated in this abject crime are in custody after having been arrested,” French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.

Oscar De La Hoya Blasts Dana White, 'Disrespectful' /nOscar De La Hoya is firing back at Dana White -- saying it was  "disrespectful " for the UFC boss to book McGregor vs. Mayweather three weeks ahead of Canelo vs. GGG.  White had previously attacked Oscar in a expletive-filled verbal smackdown after ODLH bashed the McGregor fight as nothing more than a  "circus. " Fast forward to Wednesday when Oscar appeared on ESPN with Canelo Alverez and Gennady Golovkin and was asked how he felt about Dana upstreaming him.   "It was disrespectful, " Oscar said.  "I would have thought that Dana White would have a little more respect with this boxing event taking place, because look, you just don’t do that. "  "It's like having the Super Bowl and then three weeks later the World Series takes place, the final game. It just doesn’t happen. "  "We have the whole year to stage these types of big events ... They could have maybe staged it in November or December but, look, it is what it is. "  "We have a superfight here. We have a real fight, and that’s exactly what we’re focusing on. "/n

"Cameras caught everything: Hotel/police/security weren't able to do anything. #Ricomiccon"She added, "Really upset. It's been a long night.

Gwen Stefani Crushed By Gavin Rossdale’s Latest Hookup/n
 
So this is what the truth feels like! Gwen Stefani might gush over Blake Shelton every chance she gets,
but that doesn’t mean the pop star, wasn’t crushed when she saw photos of Gavin Rossdale
making out with German model Sophia Thomalla.
“Gwen couldn’t stop rolling her eyes. She said Gavin looked like a fool and she was glad to have gotten rid of him,
but it clearly struck a nerve,” says a source,
who notes that Sophia, 27, is younger than the 51-year-old rocker’s daughter, Daisy Lowe.
“Gwen wasted no time telling Gavin that she doesn’t want the kids anywhere near this girl —
or any of the other people he’s sleeping with.” /n
Music Countdown: Who's On The Artist’s Lists?/n
As 2009 comes to an end, RadarOnline.com asked some of this year’s most prolific artists who was on their iPod this year…
Thomas Mars of Phoenix:
Dirty Projectors, a new band from Brooklyn. I saw them live and it’s amazing. They had an album that was a fantasy of a Black Flag record the guy had when he was a kid, and it’s very virtuoso, it’s really clever.
 
Faris Badwan of The Horrors:
HTRK from Australia, they just moved to London best thing I’ve heard in years.
 
Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys:
I feel a kinship with Rufus Wainwright because he’s like us, kind of fearless.
 
Colbie Caillat:
David Ryan Harris, John Mayer’s guitarist. He has a soulful, gorgeous voice.
 
Check out Colbie’s style over the year.
 
David Gray:
Pride by Phosphorescent

Courtney Taylor-Taylor of The Dandy Warhols:
The CDs in my car right now are Blitzentrapper, Band of Horses, The Bravery and Fleet Foxes.
 
Brett Anderson of  The Donnas:
Maria Taylor’s LadyLuck

Landon Pigg:
I’m just ever fiddling with Nat King Cole or Frank Sinatra. It could be the new Sufjan Stevens record, or I guess I could say the Whip It! soundtrack.
 
Evan Dando of the Lemonheads:
I like some stuff around the turn of the century but since then I haven’t liked anything. I hate Arcade Fire. I just hate anything that sounds like U2 and most things sound like U2 again now. What’s that stupid band, Kings Of Leon? They sound like U2 now. I just don’t like music—I only like old music.

Demi Lovato Disappoints With Her Overly Gelled Hair At The AMAs/n

Ooh, not her best.
Demi Lovato admitted she was feeling confident at the American Music Awards — and she should! — but we're not crazy about any aspect of her outfit.
The hair especially looks so stiff and rigid! Yikes!
Even though we usually love an homage to old Hollywood, we just don't think DemDem's black-and-gold lace Lorena Sarbu dress and heavy makeup worked on this occasion.
Of course her face was gorgeous and that's one thing that'll never change!
Thoughts???

Newly Divorced Drew Barrymore to Marry for A Fourth Time!/n




Drew Barrymore is set to wed — for the fourth time!
 The 42-year-old is itching to get hitched to her beau of nine months, David Hutchinson, pals told RADARONLINE.COM
 “Drew’s already gotten very serious with David. They’re talking about moving in together  and the next step is tying the knot!” tattled a family insider.
 David is the senior vice president of Maesa, the company that produces Drew’s Flower Beauty products  and he’s just the latest in her long line of loves.
 At 19, Drew married bar owner Jeremy Thomas, but filed for divorce less than two months later. In 1999, Drew  and comic Tom Green  said, “I do,” in July 2001, and were divorced by December.
 She then dated The Strokes drummer Fabrizio Moretti for five years, then moved on to actor Justin Long.
 In early 2011, Drew started dating art consultant Will Kopelman. They wed in June 2012, have two daughters, Olive and Frankie, and divorced in 2016.
 Now the “Charlie’s Angels” star is convinced David is “the one,” said a source. “They could be wed by the end of the year!”

'Doors' Drummer -- PUMPED Mars Rover Plays 'Break On Through'/nOne member of The Doors is amped the Mars Rover mission plays  "Break on Through " as a wake-up call in the morning -- telling TMZ, it's the perfect song for an extraterrestrial ... because The Doors are basically aliens.In case you didn't know, several crew members on the Mars Curiosity Rover Mission answered a bunch of questions on Reddit yesterday -- and one question involved the the rover's  "wake-up " songs ... i.e. songs played by mission control to start their day. (It's a Mars rover tradition, apparently)According to one crew member, the wake-up song list includes the  "Mission: Impossible " theme,  "Wake Up Little Susie " by Simon and Garfunkel,  "Come Fly With Me " by Frank Sinatra ... and the Doors hit classic.But Doors drummer John Densmore tells TMZ, he's not surprised by the crew's song selection ... claiming, “The Doors were always considered 'different'... like from Mars... no bass player, no flower power. "Densmore adds,  "[Yesterday] the mayor of West Hollywood declared it 'Doors Day.' It seems appropriate that we are also waking up the Curiosity on Mars. "Appropriate, and we love it madly./n
Oprah Going, Sally Gone/n
Mark your calendar with a big X--or maybe a big O: Oprah Winfrey has announced she's ending her talk show. But, not just yet.        Winfrey, who has agonized over whether to reup her contract in past years, has decided she will call it quits at the end of 2005-06 season. Why then? It will mark the 20th anniversary of The Oprah Winfrey Show's debut in national syndication.        While Oprah gets to pick the time for her departure from daytime, rival yakker Sally Jessy Raphael wasn't so lucky.  Producers announced Monday that The Sally Jessy Raphael Show, which debuted in 1983, will be history after the end of this season--just short of its 20-year mark--a victim of "low ratings, a tough ad market and clearance issues," according to a statement from Studios USA.        Winfrey's long-term exit strategy was revealed Monday by the Hollywood Reporter. The Chicago-based talk show queen had publicly mulled retirement three years ago before signing her current contract, which expires at the end of the 2003-04 season. Now, she has reportedly agreed to extend her run for two seasons beyond that.        Of course, 2006 is a long way off, so don't buy that going-away card just yet.        There was no immediate comment from King World Productions, the CBS-owned distributor of the show, or Winfrey's Harpo Productions, on the purported new deal, or Oprah's planned exit.        If Winfrey doesn't change her mind, her decision to quit could open up a potential gold mine for any syndicator who can come up with an ideal afternoon talk show. That's no easy task--as many have discovered. As Steve Rosenberg, president of Studios USA Domestic Television, noted in saying farewell to Raphael, "It is a testament to Sally's talent and strength that, during her tenure on the air, more than 60 other syndicated talk shows have come and gone. Sally's show will go down in the record books as an    enormous success story and she will always have our sincere thanks and gratitude."                  The famously bespectacled Raphael has been working on the tube for the past four decades. Ranked only ninth among the plethora of syndicated talk shows during the recent February sweeps (Winfrey was tops), the show--currently airing on 190 stations as well as overseas in such venues as the United Kingdom and Sweden--was averaging a minuscule 1.7 household rating. It had been renewed next season in only 70 percent of the U.S, a sharp drop from its current 98 percent exposure. So the plug was pulled        "I've been proud of many of the shows we've produced over the past two decades," says Raphael. "It was my personal statement about the issues facing society and the moral choices that people make. It has been important to me to tackle topics that are meaningful and in good taste."         With Raphael's cancellation and Winfrey eyeing the endgame, the landscape of daytime TV continues to morph drastically. Newcomers like Caroline Rhea, who'll take over for Rosie O'Donnell next season, and Oprah cohort Dr. Phil McGraw, who gets his own syndicated strip in the fall, will be among the latest to step into the fray and seek an audience amid the soap operas, cartoons and female-friendly reality shows already cramming the airwaves.

Kate Gosselin’s Sextuplets Become Teens – But Where Is Collin?/n
Kate Gosselin threw an epic 13th birthday blowout for her sextuplets – but where was troubled son Collin?
RadarOnline.com has learned Collin, who is being treated for “special needs” at a unique facility far from his home, isn’t in any of the promotional photos or videos for Kate’s upcoming tv special celebrating the milestone event.
Gosselin’s six youngest children — Aaden, Alexis, Collin, Hannah, Joel and Leah — turned 13 last month, and their 42-year-old mom treated Collin’s five siblings to a special camping trip.
As Radar exclusively reported, the teen has been sent away to live at a behavioral health facility.

“Collin has special needs,” Kate previously told People. “[There’s] a fairly fluid diagnosis of what those needs are, but he needs to learn certain strategies to help him deal with things. This has been a struggle we’ve had for a very long time, and it’s one I’ve dealt with on my own.”
And as part of his program, the new teenager can’t leave for family events and holidays, like Thanksgiving.
“Collin has serious anger issues,” an insider close to the family told Radar. “He frequently lashes out.”
The source claimed much of Collin’s anger stems from his mom and dad, Jon’s, bitter divorce.

“Collin desperately needed a mother and a father,” the source alleged. “Now, he is resentful and blames his mother for everything.”
Collin was missing from his 12th birthday party last year as well.
“He needs to be in an environment to help him learn the skills and gain the insight that he needs to be the best Collin that he can be,” Kate said on his birthday last year. “So, birthday party without Collin – tough for them, tough for mom.”
Do you think Kate should bring Collin home? Let us know in the comments!

Kim Kardashian Goes Full Jackie Kennedy for Retro-Glam Photo Shoot with Daughter North
/n
Kim Kardashian is undeniably one of the most famous women in the world. And with that level of notoriety also comes the necessary capacity to endlessly shape shift, which she does effortlessly, going from “beauty mogul” to “mom of two” to “reality star” to “swimsuit wearer.” And while the mobile mogul is never not uniquely herself, she’s also able to play a wide array of roles, from mother to video vixen to business tycoon, as well as literally channel other high profile people like Marilyn Monroe, Cher, and even, as it turns out, the First Lady of the United States. For her most recent magazine cover, Kim fronts the latest edition of Interview playing the role of Jackie Kennedy Onassis alongside her daughter North West.
In the images, shot by Steven Klein at The National Arts Club in New York City, the reality star recreates some of Onassis’ most memorable looks, breaking out the pearls, opera-length gloves, pill box hats, and a heavily hairsprayed bouffant wig, all in an attempt to give what the magazine describes as “a knowing wink to the fact that in today’s climate truly anyone can aspire to the White House.”

RELATED PHOTOS: Send Nudes: A Brief History of Kim Kardashian’s Love Affair with Her Own Naked Body
Steven Klein/Interview Magazine; Getty
The legendary photographer who last shot Kim for those controversial full frontal nudes in Love magazine’s February 2015 issue, explained the process behind this editorial, writing in a press release for the issue, “When Kim and I work together, each time we look for a different approach. We have no desire to repeat ourselves or reference anything she has done previously.”
Steven Klein/Interview Magazine
He continued, “For this shoot I wanted to capture feminine beauty as an expression of empowerment and self-respect. Also, to highlight Kim in a chic manner that is retrospective of a time and yet modern. As a model, Kim is a chameleon. She can easily change accordingly to the set intention and with little effort. It is her gift: her innate relationship to the camera. A muse of modern times.”

To accompany the images, the Selfish author also did an interview with Janet Mock, opening up about her harrowing Paris robbery, the nature of celebrity, and (coincidentally enough given Taylor Swift’s latest album announcement) her reputation. Mock commends her for making $14 million in mere hours with the recent launch of her beauty line to which Kim replies, “You can say a lot of things about me, but you cannot say I don’t work hard. I don’t sing. I don’t dance. I don’t act. But I am not lazy.”
Steven Klein/Interview Magazine
She adds that, “If I wasn’t doing what I’m doing now, or if this doesn’t work out one day, I could so be a publicist. I feel like that’s my job for the family sometimes, at least the crisis part of it.” But when asked if there was ever anything else she’s wanted to do with her life besides being extremely famous, the answer seems to be … not really.
Steven Klein/Interview Magazine
“I would look in a magazine—there was this page in Us Weekly that I remember vividly,” Kim says, “It’s just a spread, and it has one person and all the fashion moments that they love. I remember looking at it, being like, ‘It would be my dream to be this person.’ I was so excited when I got it. I still don’t take anything for granted. I am genuinely still so excited about my career. I feel like now is when someone would turn off and think, ‘Okay, I’ve done this for 10 years. I’ve done pretty well for myself. I can chill for a bit.’ But instead I’m like, ‘No, let me turn it up.'” Which has us wondering just how the reality star plans to outdo even herself. Kanye for President 2020 sounds like a pretty good place to start.

Kesha Returns With Emotional New Song Praying — Listen!!/n

It's a happy day for Kesha fans!
On Thursday, the songstress released her new track, Praying, after teasing it just a day earlier!
In case you missed it, Kesha took to Twitter on Wednesday with a short clip for her fans to thank them for their support and surprised them with the name of her single (produced this time by the totally safe and incredibly talented Ryan Lewis)!
Related: Kesha's Mom Retracts Claims About Dr. Luke!
While talking about the "hands down the hardest time" in her life, she shared:

pic.twitter.com/vvQE7XC8OQ
— kesha (@KeshaRose) July 5, 2017
In fact, thanks to the Lenny Letter, we know Kesha's next album is out August 11 and is titled Rainbow. Woo hoo!
Anywho, take a listen to Praying (below) and let us know what U think! 

This return to music is a MAJOR accomplishment for the blonde pop starlet as she's been embroiled in a pretty public feud with her music producer, Dr. Luke. In case you forgot, the Die Young artist took the songwriter (whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald) to court after accusing him of physically and mentally abusing her.
On making music following her contentious legal battle with Luke, the A-lister dished to Lena Dunham's Lenny Letter:
"I have channeled my feelings of severe hopelessness and depression, I've overcome obstacles, and I have found strength in myself even when it felt out of reach. I've found what I had thought was an unobtainable place of peace. This song is about coming to feel empathy for someone else even if they hurt you or scare you. It's a song about learning to be proud of the person you are even during low moments when you feel alone. It's also about hoping everyone, even someone who hurt you, can heal."
Well said. She continued:
"This song is about me finding peace in the fact that I can't control everything — because trying to control everyone was killing me. It's about learning to let go and realize that the universe is in control of my fate, not me."
As you surely know, the 30-year-old has faced several losses in her war against Gottwald. In regards to the depression she's battle these last few years, Kesha explained:
"There were so many days, months even, when I didn't want to get out of bed. I spent all day wanting to go to sleep, and then when I did fall asleep, I had horrible night terrors where I would physically cry and scream through the dark. I was never at peace, night or day. But I dragged myself out of bed and took my emotions to the studio and made art out of them. And I have never been happier with a body of work as I am with this record."
While we're saddened to hear that Kesha's been through such a hard time, we're glad to see that she's coming out of this drama on top. Of course, the hitmaker knows she wouldn't be here if it weren't for her fans as she concluded:
"This album is me. The most raw and real art I have ever created, and now it's my gift to you. I hope you love it. Thank you for not giving up on me. We made it <3. I love you all so much."
Welcome back, girl!

Kim Jong Un's North Korea Fires Ballistic Missile That Could Reach Alaska/n
In an ominous saber-rattling action on the 4th of July, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un fired off an apparent intercontinental ballistic missile into waters near Japan.
And it caused President Donald Trump to fire back on Twitter!
It was the communist country’s longest-range ballistic missile yet, and experts say it could reach Alaska.
PHOTOS: Inside Donald Trump’s Secret Meeting With Vladimir Putin — To OVERTHROW Dictators!
Former ambassador John Bolton worried on Fox News that the test proved North Korea was getting close to the capability of hitting the United States with nuclear weapons.
President Donald Trump mocked strongman Jong Un on Twitter, writing, “North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea….. .  and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!”
According to reports, the missile was airborne for 37 minutes. It crashed about 580 miles into the sea of Japan. The missile went off 2:40 p.m. Hawaii time. The Pentagon is working on a more detailed assessment.’
PHOTOS: Watch: President’s Half-Brother Slams His Response To Terror — Only Trump Can Defeat ISIS!
Trump has asked China to put pressure on their ally North Korea to stop the missile moves.
As Radar has reported, Trump and Jong Un have clashed for months. The President and his administration worked hard to get U.S. college student Otto Warmbier recently released from detention in North Korea. Warmbier came home in a coma and died  just days later. While North Korea claimed the student had contracted botulism, Warmbier’s parents said his death resulted from being tortured by the regime.
Trump has been on a Twitter tear for days before America’s Independence Day and has now set his sights on North Korea.
As Radar has reported, on Thursday, the President slammed Mika Brzezinksi and her Morning Joe TV co-host and fiance Joe Scarborough when he wrote that he no longer watched their MSNBC morning show and charged, “low I.Q. Crazy Mika” had been “bleeding badly from a face-lift” when she and “Psycho Joe” visited him at his Mar-a-Lago resort around New Year’s Eve.
PHOTOS: Lost Photo Album! Take A Look At The Trump Family — As You’ve Never Seen Them Before
Brzezinski denied a face lift but admitted she’d had a little skin under her chin tweaked. Top plastic surgery experts, who have not treated the TV host, have told Radar that in their opinion Brzezinski DID have a face- lift.
On Saturday, as Radar has reported, Trump launched another attack on the TV duo, tweeting, “Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!”
Trump tweeted on Sunday with an outrageous edited video clip in which he appeared to be beating up the CNN logo.
But now, the President is tweeting about a more serious foe in Jong Un!

'He Was So Laid-Back!' Accused Cruise Ship Wife Killer's Cousin 'Shocked' By Murder/n
Accused cruise ship killer Kenneth Manzanares‘ family is shocked and horrified that the “laid-back” Utah native was arrested for murdering his wife, Kristy, aboard the Emerald Princess.
In an exclusive interview, Manzanares’ first cousin Andrew Jones told Radaroline.com the accused murderer “never snapped” before the vicious attack.
“When I hung out with him, he was very laid back — never snapped. But times change, people change,” Jones claimed.

Jones said he only found out about the horrific incident while scrolling through social media.
“I had to get some clarification at first, because I found out when I first saw it on Facebook,” he recalled. “I started delving into it and progressively became more shocked.”
“I’m kind of at a loss. His father is my uncle, and I haven’t reached out yet because I want to give them some space. It’s been hectic.”

According to the criminal complaint, the mother of three suffered a “severe head wound,” and authorities discovered blood through out the family’s room on the cruise.
When a family member questioned Manzanares on what had happened, he allegedly responded, “she would not stop laughing at me.”
Witnesses initially thought the incident was a hoax, because the cruise featured a murder mystery theme.

O.J.’s Infamous Infamous Getaway Bronco To Be Pawned On Reality TV/n
It’s happening! The infamous White Ford Bronco OJ Simpson was riding during the ‘slow speed’ chase 23 years ago is getting another TV debut.
Simpson’s former sports agent, Mike Gilbert and the cars current owner has made plans on selling the car on the hit series ‘Pawn Stars,’ Radaronline.com has learned.
“Not many people realize it’s for sale … and I just thought it was a really cool thing to put on the show,” says the show’s personality Rick Harrison, who co-owns World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop.
“I never glorify gangsters or murderers on the show … and I think OJ is a douchebag … who did some really bad things. I’m a dad with six kids and I’m trying to teach each of them a little bit of morality.”
PHOTOS: TV Show Of The Century? It’s Selma Blair As Kris Jenner, David Schwimmer As Robert Kardashian & More On Set For ‘American Crime Story: The People V. OJ Simpson’
“But I felt it would be good for the show and I figured I’d give it a shot,” he said.
The timing seems to be intentional as Simpson is set for parole in October after serving 9 years in prison for armed robbery in 2007.
“I’ve been offered some OJ stuff over the years and I always tell people to go someplace else,” Harrison says. “I hate stuff like that in my store. This is one of the most conflicted episodes we’ve done.”

Gilbert reportedly purchased the 1993 car for $70,000. In 2003, it was temporarily put on display for a year at the Las Vegas casino.
On June 14,1994 — at the time the chase took place — Simpson was in the passenger seat while long-time friend AC Cowlings was driving. The chase happened five days following the murders of Ron Goldman and Simpson’s ex-wife Nicole.
The episode, “If the Pawn Don’t Fit,” is set to air on August 14 at 10 p.m. on The History Channel.

ATL Hawks Sued for Allegedly Treating Black Stars Like Criminals /nDrake, Kanye West, Migos and Tyler Perry got put through the ringer before being allowed to perform at Philips Arena in ATL ... while Amy Schumer and Bon Jovi got the VIP treatment. And why?? Blackness ... allegedly. A former Atlanta Hawks security manager -- who also ran event security at Philips Arena -- is suing the team claiming he was wrongly fired after pointing out a system of discrimination against black celebs at the arena, which is operated and staffed by the Hawks.  Sam Hayes says it was obvious from the start of his employment in August 2016 that his white boss was going out of his way to make black stars go through more rigorous security checks than white stars. On August 26, Drake and Future performed at Philips Arena and had asked to bypass metal detectors on their way inside but their requests were denied. One week later, AC /DC performed and made the same metal detector bypass request -- but theirs was granted. The pattern continued ...  Kanye West -- DENIED The Comedy Get Down World Tour (Cedric the Entertainer, Eddie Griffin, D.L. Hughley) -- DENIED 2 Chainz, Jeezy, The Dream -- DENIED Old School Hip Hop Fest -- DENIED Migos -- DENIED Tyler Perry -- DENIED Katt Williams -- DENIED (okay, that one makes sense) Amy Schumer -- GRANTED Adele -- GRANTED Ariana Grande -- GRANTED (Hayes says she  "doesn't like people looking at her "). WWE Live Tour -- GRANTED Bon Jovi -- GRANTED Ringling Brothers -- GRANTED Hayes claims things came to a head in April 2017 when a black security officer told a white member of Radiohead's crew he had to walk through a metal detector -- and the crew member responded by dropping his pants. Hayes says a white staffer intervened and allowed the crew member to bypass. Hayes says he went to management and was told,  "Hip hop acts draw a different crowd and the white acts bring in more money. " Hayes says he was ultimately fired for bringing the issues to light -- though he was told he was axed for reprimanding lower level staffers without first consulting Human Resources. He's demanding unspecified damages.  The Hawks are adamantly denying the allegations -- with a team spokesperson telling TMZ Sports,  "[Samuel Hayes] was terminated for poor performance and his claims are baseless. "  "We will defend vigorously.”/n

She may have a song dedicated to her Louboutins, but Jennifer Lopez teamed up with Giuseppe Zanotti for her new shoe collection.

On Thursday (Jan. 26, 2017), the “Ain’t Your Mama” singer celebrated the new fashion line at Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills. Clad in a cleavage-baring white number from Cushnie et Ochs, J.Lo toasted the collaboration and explained how the project was near and dear to her heart. According to her, every shoe was named after a strong woman in her family — including sisters Leslie and Lynda.
“I think of family and they’re my stability, they keep me grounded,” she told Entertainment Tonight. “There was a connection there, so I was like, ‘I’m going to name it after all the women in my family.'”
Lopez also explained why she named a pink python-printed gladiator sandal after her 8-year-old daughter Emme, saying, “She’s soft and fierce, you know what I mean? She is like, the combination of everything good in this world.”
How cute!

EXCLUSIVE! Grey's Anatomy's Jessica Capshaw Teases "Tough" Road Ahead for Arizona and Callie It was the "noooooo" heard around Grey's Anatomy fans' living rooms when we saw that Arizona (Jessica Capsha.../n
It was the "noooooo" heard around Grey's Anatomy fans' living rooms when we saw that Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) was left with one leg post-plane crash and that wife Callie (Sara Ramirez) was the one who most likely amputated it.So is one of TV's most beloved couples in trouble this season? We talked to Jessica, who dished about Arizona and Callie's rocky road ahead:

"It's going to be tough in the beginning," Jessica confirmed (ugh!). "The first couple of episodes deal with how the leg came to be taken, who took it, and not only who is to blame, but who is responsible."Judging by what Jessica had to say next, our bets are still on Callie. "The worst thing happens to you, and you think it happens at the hands of the person who is supposed to be the best thing that ever happened to you, so it's a tough dilemma."

"But, you have to kind of lean into it," continued Jessica. "I mean, I have such a gift—I got to play this person that was just sunshine, light and everything good in the world, and now it's come to pass that there are opposites in life, and you have to be able to see what the other side of her is. And you will!"There is no way Shonda Rhimes would take Eric Dane from us then break up Callie and Arizona, right? Right?!Grey's Anatomy airs tonight on ABC at 9 p.m.

When it boils down to it, the Academy Awards ceremonies are really just annual proms for the famous people working in Hollywood.

We watch the arrivals on E! to see which gowns made it from the runway to the red carpet and lose track of how many tailored Tom Ford suits parade on by. We bite our nails when someone nears a wardrobe malfunction and gasp (then laugh) when someone takes a gentle tumble, but in its entirety, the Oscars have always been a celebration of the beauty in film, acting, score composition, directing, and screenwriting. This is why we feel it’s our duty to kick off tonight’s commemoration of visually pleasing things by presenting you with a collection of the hottest couples that have hit the Oscars red carpet throughout the years.

Also pretty stinking cute? When Channing starts talking about his wife of six years. "...Jenna is a super mom," he gushed to Vanity Fair's August issue. " There's no other way to say it. She is there every single second, every single day. I love being a dad. They're like little mirrors running around. They show you things about yourself you wouldn't pay attention to before. Jenna says it all the time: 'Oh, my God, that is so you right there.' But I don't know if I'm good at it."Well, not every dad would dress up as Pooh Bear to delight his little girl, so we're going to guess he's doing an A-OK job so far. Channing seems to have a pretty laid-back approach to parenting, too. As he put it, "I think Woody Allen was right when he said 80 percent of success is just showing up."

"Conversely, I know some guys that would've been better off without their fathers around," he told Vanity Fair. "It's case-by-case: did you get loved too much or not enough? I now look back on my own parents and have a better appreciation."

Vicki Gunvalson & Kelly Dodd Fuming At Peggy Sulahian Homophobia Allegations/n
The Real Housewives of Orange County star Peggy Sulahian’s costars are taking sides in her nasty family feud — and it’s not hers!
RadarOnline.com can exclusively report that Vicki Gunvalson, 55 and Kelly Dodd, 43, are livid after learning accusations that the 43-year-old is “homophobic,” and shut her own brother out of her life and their father’s funeral.
In addition to supporting LGBTQ rights, Gunvalson and Dodd just so happen to be longtime friends with Sulahian’s estranged brother, celebrity fashion designer Pol’ Atteu, and his fiancé Patrik Simpson.

“Vicki, Kelly and some of the other girls are completely blindsided by this Peggy stuff. They could not even believe it at first,” a production source said.
“Vicki is absolutely through the roof because she has known Pol’ and his fiancé Patrik for several years and was even recently in their Beverly Hills Boutique!”
According to the source, “Vicki feels betrayed a bit because she befriended Peggy. She is not going to treat her the same after this. Vicki has zero tolerance for anti-gay actions, and she does not want Peggy on the cast if this is who she truly is.”

"a small ceremony in New York City" at City Hall on Tuesday, People confirmed.  Together, the newly married couple shares 9-year-old French bulldog, Mabel, about whom they've written a children's book called Naughty Mabel.../n
After nearly two decades of dating, Nathan Lane has finally tied the knot to Devlin Elliott. The 59-year-old Tony winner wed his longtime partner, producer and playwright Elliott, in "a small ceremony in New York City" at City Hall on Tuesday, People confirmed. Together, the newly married couple shares 9-year-old French bulldog, Mabel, about whom they've written a children's book called Naughty Mabel. "She's become our version of a child," Elliott told USA Today of their beloved pet. "Really all she wants is for you to pick her up and hold her like a baby."

Just before The Producers star began dating Elliott, he iconically told an Us Weekly reporter who asked if he was gay, "I'm 40, single and work a lot in the musical theater. You do the math."After years of speculation over Lane's sexual orientation, the Broadway star famously confirmed he was gay in 1999, though he had already told his family many years before at age 21. "I just assume a lot of people know," Lane told The Advocate 16 years ago. "It's never been something I kept a secret."However, the killing of 21-year-old Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard that year drove the longtime public figure to declare his orientation for the sake of others in the LGBT community. "If I do this story and say I'm a gay person, it might make it easier for somebody else," Lane told the magazine. Congratulations to the happy couple!

Love Leader Arthur Lee Dead/n
     Arthur Lee, the eccentric singer-guitarist and driving force behind the 1960s' cult psychedelic rock band Love, has died. He was 61.          According to his manager, Mark Linn, Lee lost his fight with leukemia Thursday at Methodist University Hospital in his hometown of Memphis.          "His death comes as a shock to me because Arthur had the uncanny ability to bounce back from everything, and leukemia was no exception," Linn told Reuters. "He was confident that he would be back on stage by the fall."          With its multiracial lineup, Love mixed R&B;, garage and folk rock and even symphonic music and proto-punk into a sound that confounded critics and helped usher in the mind-bending psychedelic rock scene so popular in that turbulent decade.          Lee, who referred to himself the "first so-called black hippie," originally named his band the Grass Roots, but was forced to drop it because another act had the same moniker. As the story goes, he chose Love above alternatives like Poetic Justice and Dr. Strangelove after polling the audience at a club gig.          Despite changes to the lineup, Love went on to release three pioneering albums, beginning with its 1966's self-titled debut, which included the Hal David-Burt Bacharach-penned "My Little Red Book. The band followed up with 1967's Da Capo, which featured the single  "7 & 7." But it wasn't until later that same year that Love reached its creative zenith with Forever Changes.          After an initially weak debut on the charts, the album gained an underground following and has since come to be regarded as a classic, ranking 40th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 best albums of all time.           Born Mar. 7, 1945 in Memphis, Lee and his family moved to Los Angeles where he learned to play a variety of instruments. After a stint writing surf songs in the early '60s and working with a then-unknown session musician named Jimi Hendrix, he went on to found Love in Los Angeles in 1965.           Lee's sardonic, humorous lyrics combined with Love's thunderous sound is credited with influencing generations of bands, ranging from Led Zeppelin to Echo and the Bunnymen to Siouxsie and the Bankshees.          Lee's increasingly erratic behavior onstage and off took their toll on Love. After Forever Changes, the members went their separate ways and Lee tried his hand at a solo career which never quite took off.           The 1980s saw several aborted attempts to reunite Love, but eventually the volatile frontman dropped off the music industry radar. It wasn't until  the release of 1992's Arthur Lee & Love that the singer returned to the spotlight.          But the comeback was short-lived. In 1996, the rocker was convicted for illegal possession of a firearm and ended up spending six years in a California prison.          After getting out in 2001, Lee resumed touring the U.S. and Europe with a new version of Love billed as "Love with Arthur Lee" that culminated in the release of a live CD and DVD in 2003. Two years later, he quit the band and was diagnosed with leukemia, for which he received a bone marrow transplant last May.          Lee is survived by his wife, Diane. Funeral arrangements are pending.

“There was no expression of sorry,” he said. “What I heard were excuses from his youth. I believe everyone is responsible for their own actions, and the jury here has made him responsible for his.” 
In an exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com, Christopher expressed his congratulations to Petit, 55, who announced his engagement to fiancée, Christine Paluf, 34, earlier this month.

Also opening up at the official sentencing was juror Tashana Milton of West Haven, who said she was traumatized and suffering from paranoia caused by the grisly details she heard during the trial.

“I wonder if he really feels bad about what’s happened,” she said, after hearing Komisarjevsky’s speech. “I couldn’t tell.”
Later in the proceedings, Dr. Petit described the loving family who had been stolen from him by the pair of home invaders. Calling 11-year-old Michaela, nicknamed KK, “a happy girl who managed to get along with everyone. She loved to cook, care for animals, play music, plant flowers and sing.

“I will never again see the twinkle in KK’s eyes when she makes me breakfast for my birthday,” Petit said.
Hayley, 17, had been accepted into Dartmouth College shortly before she died of smoke inhalation while tied to her bed. “She was a good, kind gentle soul,” he said.

Rev. Richard Hawke, Jennifer’s father, addressed the man who killed his daughter and grandchildren personally via video.
“Now, you are a prison number listed in the book of death. You are now in God’s hands,” he said.

Brandi Glanville‘s never one to blanch at a little spicy talk, and the hot-bodied housewife didn’t let us down in a new Q&A with our friends at OK!, where she dishes about her favorite topics: suitors, social media and sex!
The outspoken reality star who was famously married to Eddie Cibrian (and once hooked up with Gerard Butler) says she’s sworn off any men who make their living on a stage, court or field.
“It doesn’t ever seem to end well for me, and it’s usually more about them and their ego,” she said. “There’s a lot of ego stroking and other stroking that you have to do … it’s really hard to see the person you love on TV making out with another person.

“So no more actors for me and no more athletes, because there are just too many options for them. They could have any girl that they want — and they have them all.”
The 41-year-old mother-of-two said she’s looking for maturity and stability in her next mate, preferring a man who’s “five to eight years older,” and “has a dog or a plant that’s not fake, or something else that shows some level of commitment.”
One obstacle the outspoken Bravolebrity says she might have in her look for love is her penchant for controversial tweets, as she herself says that social media‘s “ruining romance.

“Social media is making us incredibly unsocial, little by little,” she explained, noting that “no one wants weird pictures of themselves out on social media so it’s keeping us from being social and being able to interact without worrying … it’s ruining our trust in people.”
If she can’t find Mr. Right and has to settle for Mr. Right Now, at least she’s got the proper ground rules for the occasional booty call.
She explained, “There are three rules for a booty call: One is you don’t kiss. Two is you never stay the night. And three is, you have to choose wisely, because if you pick someone you’re emotionally invested in it can reopen bad feelings.”

5 Things That You May Not Know About Marion Cotillard/n





                    Report: Angelina Jolie Filed for Divorce from Brad Pitt After Uncovering Affair with Marion Cotillard
                







Is this the real reason behind their split. 

 MORE >>





As soon as the news broke that Angeline Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, fans of the long-time couple immediately tried to figure out why. While neither Jolie nor Pitt have confirmed the real reason behind their split (and probably never will), it didn’t take long for everyone to jump to conclusions, and that’s where Marion Cotillard comes in.

Cotillard is starring alongside Pitt in the upcoming film Allied, and therefore, given Pitt’s past, she is now being accused of being Pitt’s alleged mistress. While multiple sources have insisted there is absolutely nothing going on between Pitt and Cotillard, some people want to know more about the award winning actress.
Here are five fast facts to help you brush up on your Cotillard knowledge.
1. She’s an award-winning actress. 
While her name might not be familiar, you’ve definitely seen her work. Cotillard began acting more than 20 years ago in France and got her big break in the United States in a supporting role in the Tim Burton film, Big Fish. Since then, she’s starred in films including Inception, Midnight in Paris, and The Dark Knight Rises. Cotillard is the first, and so far only, actor to win an Academy Award for a performance in French, an award she earned for her critically acclaimed role as Édith Piaf in the 2007 film, La Vie En Rose. 
2. She’s a musician.
In addition to being an award-winning actress, Cotillard is an accomplished singer-songwriter and musician who plays guitar, bass guitar, keyboard, and tambourine. Cotillard often writes and sings the songs that are featured in her various Lady Dior campaigns.
3. She’s an environmental activist.
Cotillard is making sure to use her fame for good, using her name to bring awareness to environmental issues and acting as a spokesperson for Greenpeace since 2002. In 2013, Cotillard caged herself in Paris near the Louvre museum holding up a sign that read, “I am a climate defender,” and demanded the release of jailed Greenpeace activists in Russia.
4. Acting is in her DNA.
While Cotillard always believed she would become a singer, she’s been surrounded by performers her entire life. Her father is French actor Jean-Claude Cotillard and her mother, Niseema Theillaud, was an acting teacher.
5. She’s in a long-term relationship. 
Cotillard has been in a relationship with French actor and director Guillaume Canet since 2007, and the two even share a five-year-old son named Marcel together. While they have been in a committed relationship for close to a decade, they haven’t made the decision to tie the knot just yet.

Tiger Woods Checks Back Into Rehab To Keep His Kids/n
Tiger Woods is headed back to rehab after his humiliating DUI arrest, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.
The shamed star, 41, secretly arranged a 28-day rehab stint in a bid to retain joint custody of daughter Sam, 9, and son, Charlie, 8.
According to sources, the fallen golf legend — who was busted in the wee hours of May 29 — has reserved the entire male inpatient unit at the Jupiter Medical Center near his Florida mansion.

“Tiger visited the hospital with his children on June 2, then went alone two days later to complete paperwork and his assessment,” an insider told Radar.
According to that clause, “if Tiger gets caught up in a scandal, he could face losing the 20 percent custody he currently has,” the insider spilled, adding the disgraced athlete’s treatment will focus on his addiction to prescription pills.
As the National ENQUIRER reported, Tiger entered The Meadows treatment center in Wickburg, Ariz., in 2010 to battle addictions to the powerful painkiller Vicodin and the sleeping medication Ambien.

That rehab stint followed Tiger’s six-week treatment for sex addiction at the Gentle Path facility in Hattiesburg, Miss.
He was forced into treatment after National ENQUIRER exposed his affair with a New York City party girl in late 2009 — leading to a procession of mistresses to come forward.
The cheating scandal ruined Tiger’s squeaky clean image, cost him millions in endorsements and virtually ended his glittery golf career.

Since then, Tiger’s undergone several surgeries for golf-related injuries, and his reputation took another hit when Florida cops found him asleep at the wheel of his dinged-up Mercedes SUV.
A woozy Tiger failed a sobriety test, admitted to taking a cocktail of prescription drugs, including Vicodin, and was charged with DUI.
The troubled athlete’s drug woes have prompted Elin to consider going back to court for temporary full custody of their children, sources said.
A snitch added: “Elin wants Tiger to get professional help before the kids spend a single night alone with him again! God forbid they’re in the car when he’s drugged up!”

Some of the photos show the woman who is allegedly Lawrence taking the photos herself, while others appear to be taken by someone else. A few of the photos show what appears to be Lawrence in various bathing suits ... but others are fully nude.There are a ton of other partially nude photos of celebrities posted today ... the alleged victims include Kate Upton, Victoria Justice, Ariana Grande, Kirsten Dunst, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski, and Teresa Palmer.Lawrence's spokespeople tell TMZ,  "This is a flagrant violation of privacy. The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence. "We're reaching out to the reps for the women involved. So far, no word back ...Update 3:25 PM PT -- Victoria Justice denied the photos going around claiming to be her are authentic, writing on Twitter,  "These so called nudes of me are FAKE people.

Blac Chyna Tries To 'Take Back' Car She Gave Rob Kardashian?/n
Blac Chyna reportedly tried to drive off in Rob Kardashian‘s Range Rover, the vehicle she had gifted him when times were good, as the Daily Mail has reported.
The battling couple, who bitterly split up after having daughter Dream together, was reportedly meeting to discuss custody of the girl when the wacky incident happened.
Although Chyna’s lawyer denied the reports, sources said Kardashian and his baby mama met up at the Los Angeles offices of his attorney Laura Wasser on Friday where, after attempting to solidify a custody agreement over Dream, 9 months, they clashed over the luxury SUV.

According to the Daily Mail, citing other reporting, after talks failed between Kardashian, 30, and Chyna, 29, the “agitated” former stripper tried to drive off in the vehicle. But one of her five lawyers and a valet allegedly stopped her.
But Lisa Bloom, one of the lawyers representing Chyna and who had accompanied her to the Century City offices, denied that her client attempted to drive away in the Range Rover, or even got into it.
Still, Bloom admitted that Chyna did have some “choice words” when she saw the vehicle.
It has become a bone of contention as Chyna has reportedly already returned a Ferrari and a Lamborghini which had been gifts from Kardashian.

But the troubled Keeping Up with the Kardashians brother apparently kept the Range Rover Chyna had given him!
As Radar has reported, Chyna has moved on with a romance with rapper Mechie, one of the men Kardashian freaked out about in his infamous social media meltdown about his baby mama.
Chyna got a restraining order against Rob after he blasted her online, sharing explicit naked photos of the former stripper to his millions of fans, along with shocking allegations of her cheating with Pilot Jones as well as being in bed with Mechie. Via Instagram, Rob also accused Chyna of drug use.

As part of their bitter he said-she said battle, Chyna contemplated legal action against Kardashian, using “revenge porn law” as the basis for her claims. She has also accused baby daddy Kardashian of abusing her.
Now, as they are trying to negotiate custody of Dream, Chyna and Kardashian have reportedly hit a new bump in the road!

MAD CHATTER: Jon Hamm called out Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton for winning fame and fortune by acting like "f--king idiots" on TV—but he didn't mean anything by it! And why would Kim get all mad? She's rich and famous! (We don't know how Paris reacted, because we don't care.)MORE OF MORRIS: Provocative photos of Heather Morris were leaked, an apparent result of the latest celebrity-phone hack job. But the Glee star isn't ashamed, heck no! In fact, she wonders why more stars don't capture themselves in the buff while they're at their best.

SWAN SONG: Jermaine Jones, already a last-minute addition to American Idol's live rounds, was disqualified after producers found out about his rap sheet—which they say wouldn't have hurt him if he had just come clean in the first place.

neutral eye, Jamie used the Anastasia Beverly Hills Master Palette By Mario and the Lorac Pro Palette 3. For a base, blend two light brown shades, like Lula and Isabel by Anastasia, into the crease of your eye. To give it a fresh fall twist,.../n
Fall is here and you know what that means: Brand new makeup palettes are out! That's right; it's that time of year when your favorite beauty brands release their new collections of colors, just in time for the holidays.Confused on which palette you should swoop up this season? Lucky for you, celeb makeup artist Jamie Greenburg (who has worked with Kaley Cuoco, Tracee Ellis Ross, Rashida Jones and Kristen Stewart) shared her favorites. And that's not all! She even gave us a few ideas on how to use them. "When you have these at home, you become your own makeup artist," shared Jamie.

Pro tip: Before you do anything, you need an eye shadow primer, like Urban Decay Original Eyeshadow Primer Potion in Nude. Why? If you want to get the exact color you see in the palette (and not a sheerer, less bright version), a primer makes it show up as is.Now onto the palette party!

For a New Way to Wear Neutrals

The point of using a palette is it's a one-stop shop, but you, by no means, have to stick to just one. For instance, to create a reddish take on a neutral eye, Jamie used the Anastasia Beverly Hills Master Palette By Mario and the Lorac Pro Palette 3. For a base, blend two light brown shades, like Lula and Isabel by Anastasia, into the crease of your eye. To give it a fresh fall twist, add a pop of color to the center of the lid and on the bottom waterline using a deeper shade, like Amethyst from the Lorac palette. Pro tip: Wet a black or dark brown shade, like Lorac's Jet Black, and use in the place of your eyeliner.

For a Bright Pop of Color

And if you want to add a zing on top of existing neutral shadow, the Urban Decay Cosmetics Full Spectrum Eyeshadow Palette, is for you. Rule number one: Don't be afraid of loud colors. To pump up the pigment, take a flat bristle brush and place a vivid shade, like Calavera (a bright yellow), at the inner corner as well as at the center. Pick another citrus shade, like Jones (a tangerine hue), and add it to the outer and inner corners.Pro tip: When you're applying color, be sure to apply the shadow in a dabbing motion. Once all of the product is on the lid, swirl in a blending motion.

 'Bachelorette' Rachel Slams Lee With 'Black History' & 'Women's Rights' Lessons On.../n
On Monday’s The Bachelorette: Men Tell All, Rachel Lindsay‘s former flames spoke up about the explosive drama that took over the house as the gorgeous Bachelorette tried to find her soul mate.
The fiery episode touched on known issues such as Lee Garrett‘s racists tweets, as well as on DeMario Jackson‘s “side chick.”
As fans know, Jackson signed up to film the show while he still had a serious girlfriend at home. He allegedly was ignoring her and cut off communication until she found out he was filming and confronted him on the show. Lindsay pointed him to the door.
PHOTOS: UNCOVERED! Secrets & Scandals Of Rachel Lindsay’s ‘Bachelorette’ Contestants
After losing to beloved Kenny King after a dramatic two-on-one date with the Bachelorette, Garrett posted a series of extremely offensive tweets that sent the men in the house – and Lindsay – into a rampage.
“What’s the difference between the NAACP and the KKK? One has a sense of shame to cover their racist a** faces,” read one of the tweets.
“I said things I should not have said; they were inconsiderate.”

Said Lindsay: “You had such an amazing opportunity to be surrounded by different people and different cultures and you didn’t take advantage of that. I hope that in watching it back you realize that you were a part of something so great. But in case you didn’t, please know you could exit stage left and meet me backstage and I’d be more than happy to give you a black history lesson, a lesson on women’s rights, you know what I’m saying?”
Garrett’s rival, King, was known as the doting father of the show. His daughter McKenzie – for whom he left the show – even made a surprise appearance on the episode.
“Kenny might have been the most well-liked guy in the house and it’s hard to say the same about Lee,” said baby-faced Dean Unglert.

Unglert – whom Lindsay sent home after declaring her love for him – voiced his confusion to the Bachelorette, saying: I’m still confused about why you told me you were falling in love with me and then I got the boot four days later.”
Lindsay stated that it was “very, very difficult,” and the former contestant agreed to let it go. He will now be appearing on Bachelor in Paradise!

 Her Heart Will Go On! Celine Dion Finds Love Again With Boy Toy Dancer After Husband's.../n
Superstar Celine Dion, who once bragged she was a one-man woman, has a new boy toy young enough to be her son!
Her relationship with hunky Spanish dancer Pepe Munoz, 32, has set tongues wagging.
Celine hired Pepe as a backup dancer on her European summer tour — and sparks flew immediately, sources reveal.
“Meeting Pepe has put a pep in her step,” spills an insider. “He makes her feel beautiful, sexy and alive.”
PHOTOS: Celine Dion Pays Tribute To Late Husband On His 1-Year Death Anniversary
The pair was spotted attending a Paris fashion show, and getting intimate on romantic dates.
Celine has struggled to find happiness since the January 2016 cancer deaths of her 73-year-old manager hubby Rene Angelil — the only man she’d ever bedded — and her brother Daniel, 59.
“I never kissed another man in my life,” the superstar confessed about the man she married at age 26 — when Rene was 52!
PHOTOS: Celine Dion & Cher’s Feud Erupts Backstage At Billboard Music Awards
Recently, insiders worried the 49-year-old mother of three — Rene-Charles, 16, and 6-year-old twins Eddy and Nelson — was cracking up after a series of VERY bizarre antics in Paris.
A rep downplayed the drama saying Celine has “always had a playful, sometimes zany, side.”
Now it looks like the “My Heart Will Go On’  singer is crazy in love, even though her rep insists they’re just friends!
“She never expected to feel this way again after Rene died,” says the source. “Their sexy dances on stage detonated a passion in Celine, and she’s having fun and letting go of her inhibitions.”
“She knows she should take it slow with Pepe, but she finds him irresistible!”

'Big Brother' Sexual Hijinks, Butt Poking Rampant, 'You Punched My Vagina!'/nThe  "Big Brother " house is a cauldron of sexual shenanigans ... or so it seems judging from the 24-hour live feeds. It's shocking ... a male cast member grabbing Jessica Graf's vagina, women butt poking men, men butt poking women, men butt poking men, and it's all on video. TMZ broke the story ... Jessica appeared to start it, and it seemed it was to the dismay of other housemates. But now we see, it's become a thing in the house. These latest clips show Matthew Clines﻿, Paul Abrahamian, Ramses Soto and Elena Davies all partaking in a sneak butt poke or two. Paul gets 2 off, both on male cast members ... one of whom Elena also pokes. Jessica Graf ﻿even accuses Matt of punching her vagina ... and her roommates laugh. It's interesting ... Matt called Jessica a sexual predator when she poked his ass, and Paul later complained to Kevin about Jessica's ongoing poke joke in the house. We got Les Moonves out at Craig's last night and he said he hadn't seen the footage of Jessica, but he would watch it today.   Stay tuned/n

5 Seconds of Summer's Michael Clifford Responds to Ex Abigail Breslin's "You Suck" Video—Watch! So what does Michael Clifford have to say about ex Abigail Breslin maybe saying that he sucks? Not much. The 5 Seconds of Sum.../n
So what does Michael Clifford have to say about ex Abigail Breslin maybe saying that he sucks? Not much.The 5 Seconds of Summer guitarist was rumored to be the inspiration behind the actress's debut music video "You Suck," and yes, as you can imagine from the title, it wasn't exactly praising her ex-boyfriend.Clifford was asked about the interesting release during an Australian radio interview on Nova FM recently. "I haven't spoken to her in a year," Clifford shyly told host Kent "Smallzy" Small, noting that he does have tattoos and dyed hair as mentioned in the lyrics.




McAf / Splash News

Smallzy did warn Clifford about constantly bleaching his hair, telling the young musician that his locks will eventually fall out. "That's the one lesson learned," Michael joked.Bandmate Luke Hemmings did offer the argument that Breslin's song may not be about his pal. "We don't know for sure that it's about Michael," he (maybe sarcastically) said. "It could be about anyone."Whether Luke was mocking the situation or not, there was some speculation that "You Suck" may have been about Breslin's other ex-boyfriend Jack Barakat (who also has bleached hair and tattoos). She also sings that the guy in question "sounds like All Time Low," which points the finger at Barakat because that's the name of his band.Who do you think the song is about?

Byron Scott Divorce -- Wife Demands Baller Lifestyle ... I Can't Live Without My Gucci! /nShe lived the Gucci lifestyle before the divorce ... and now Byron Scott's wife is demanding the Gucci lifestyle AFTER the split too -- telling a judge the Lakers coach needs to pay up so she can continue to live like a BOSS!We broke the story ... Byron filed for divorce from his college sweetheart Anita Scott last year after 29 years of marriage -- right before he signed a $17 million contract with the Lakers. But Anita says they were living large way before the Lakers gig -- and in new court docs obtained by TMZ Sports, she spells out why Scott needs to open up his checkbook. Here's a sample of the life Anita says she was accustomed to during her marriage to Byron: BALLER MANSIONS -- Anita says the couple lived in several insane cribs over the years (8 bedroom pad in NJ, 7 bedroom house in New Orleans, swanky 4 bedroom penthouse in Cleveland). BALLER SHOPPING SPREES -- Anita says she  "regularly " bought clothes from Chanel, Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton ... with no specific dollar limit. BALLER HAIR -- Anita says she dropped at least $600 every six weeks for hair upkeep ... and $500-per-month on manis, pedis and massages. Plus another $400-per-month on facials and  "other personal maintenance. "BALLER VACATIONS-- The Bahamas. Once a year. First class airfare. Suites at top-rated resorts. Oh, and they'd often pay for additional family members to join along. Anita says she needs spousal support asap, since she doesn't have a job and is living in a cramped 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom condo in Culver City which is  "not comparable to the lavish and spacious homes we purchased during the marriage.

Anthony Anderson Recounts His Surprise Run-in with 50 Cent at Prince Albert’s Palace/n

Party at Prince Albert‘s palace!
Anthony Anderson, 46, and 50 Cent, 41, unexpectedly found themselves mingling with royalty in Monaco over the weekend, and the Black-ish star recounted the tale to PEOPLE Now on Wednesday.
While chatting about hosting his third season of To Tell The Truth, Anderson opened up about his surprise run-in with his pal at the uber formal party.

A post shared by Anthony Anderson (@anthonyanderson) on Jun 19, 2017 at 10:08am PDT


“I mean, maybe you should ask the rap superstar, ‘How was it hanging out with the television and film superstar at the castle?'” said Anderson after being asked to relive the moment.
“I’ve known 50 [Cent] for a while and I was surprised to see him there, just like he was surprised to see me there,” he adds. “We both know Prince Albert.”

A post shared by 50 Cent (@50cent) on Jun 18, 2017 at 1:19pm PDT


The star-studded evening also drew notables like the Prince’s wife Princess Charlene of Monaco, Wilmer Valderrama and Josh Henderson. And 50 Cent crossed paths with the Prince yet again just one day later on the red carpet for the 2017 Golden Nymph Awards in Monte Carlo on June 19.
“It’s funny — we were talking and Prince Albert came over and said, ‘Hey, yeah, 50, they let you back in the country.’ Apparently they kicked him out at one point!”
The third season of To Tell The Truth premieres Wednesday at 10 p.m. EST on ABC.

 ‘I’m Not Going To Bury You!’ Todd Chrisley In Tears Over Savannah’s Tragic Car.../n
Savannah Chrisley was involved in a car accident that left her hospitalized – and it left her father in tears. Todd Chrisley breaks down over his daughter’s crash in a sneak peek for the return of Chrisley Knows Best.
“To have someone say your daughter has been in an accident and you have to come to the hospital, that is the phone call I have dreaded,” Todd cried in the trailer. “You are my child, but I’m not going to bury you because God did not send me here equipped to do that.”
The 19-year-old suffered broken vertebrae when she crashed her car into a guardrail.

“Vehicle one was traveling south bound on Interstate 65 near Armory Drive,” the police report obtained by Radar read. “The driver of vehicle number one advised officers that her foot became tangled up in the floor mat and then behind the brake pedal in the process of trying to free her foot.”
Savannah wrote on Instagram at the time of the crash, “We all make mistakes…all that matters is how we learn and grow from them. I truly believe that God has used this situation to open my eyes to what is truly important in life and to put my focus back on Him in order to live the right life and be unbelievably happy. So right now I just want to say thank you again…love you all.”
But Savannah wasn’t off the road for long, as she was back behind the wheel only a week later.

“Who say I ain’t brave,” Todd captioned a photo of his daughter driving.
The upcoming episodes will also feature Todd’s son Chase getting a new dog, his wife Julie recovering from bunion surgery and Todd trying to get his “zoo under control!”
Chrisley Knows Best returns Tuesday at 10/9c on USA.

Khloe Kardashian’s Hair Was Styled Using Only Products From a Drugstore: Get the Look/n
While the Kardashian/Jenner clan stick to designer brands when it comes to their beauty routine, sometimes life happens, and they do the unthinkable: make do with products from the drugstore. Such was the case for Khloé Kardashian earlier this week.

KoKo’s hairstylist Jen Atkin ended up losing her luggage during a quick trip to Chicago on Monday and was forced to visit the local drugstore.
http://instagram.com/p/1_pdHrSBUB/
“When your hair kit doesn’t make your flight? You make lemonade out of sour lemons at the local Walgreens! Wish me luck today!” Atkin wrote on Instagram, adding a positive, “At least I found pink leopard!”
The lemonade actually turned out pretty sweet. Using the drugstore products and tools (and a little hairstylist magic), Atkin took Khloé’s hair from a knotted up-do to loose, beachy blonde waves that actually looked seriously fab (see the photo above).
So how did Atkin get the look? With these 17 products that cost under $100 total:

Conair hair clips (two packs)
John Frieda blow dryer (which she claims became one of her favorite products)
Leopard beauty bag
Kardashian Beauty straightener
Conair curling iron
Frederic Fekkai glossing crème
Sexy Hair “Slept In” texture crème
Tigi Catwalk curling amplifier 
Dove Dry Shampoo
L’Oreal Advanced Txt It toussle wave spray
Bobbi pins
Rubber bands

Kate Middleton and Prince William are expecting a royal baby but the big question is: Will it be a boy or a girl?
While the couple hasn’t released the baby’s gender yet, the odds are slim that they will announce what they’re having, according to royal historian Carolyn Harris.
“If the Dutchess of Cambridge gives birth to a son, he will automatically be a prince,” Harris explained.
The same isn’t so if she births a daughter, however.
“If she has a daughter she would be named a lady,” Harris said. “But it is likely that the Queen would make an exception to her title so that she could be named a princess.”

Yolanda Hadid Reveals How Lyme Disease Led to Her Divorce from David Foster: ‘I Have No Bad Feelings About It’/n

Yolanda Hadid was just starting a new life with husband David Foster when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012.
Symptoms like joint pain, exhaustion, insomnia, and anxiety plagued her daily and simple things like answering an email became difficult. Her fatigue became so severe that even walking from the bedroom to the bathroom was a struggle. As a result, her relationship with David drastically changed.
“All of a sudden all of the things we shared, all of the things we used to love to do together, go for walks in the morning, having a studio in the house and blasting music all day, having dinner parties, that all shut down,” she says. “I couldn’t participate in that life anymore.”
Despite Yolanda’s best efforts, she was unable to maintain her former lifestyle and her illness took a toll on her marriage.

For more on Yolanda’s battle with Lyme disease, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday

“I’m starting to feel that David is unhappy with the fact that I can’t be by his side the way that I used to be,” she writes in her memoir, Believe Me: My Battle With the Invisibility of Lyme Disease. “I try to make light of it and joke that he married a lemon. It’s sad but true. I went from being the funny girlfriend who was up for anything and had endless energy to the wife who is too sick to be by his side.”

“He lost his wingman, his partner in crime, and I fell as if he’s starting to get impatient with my recovery. I understand that even brief periods of illness can strain important relationships in your life. A chronic condition like mine, one that has consumed years of our lives, poses enormous challenges.”
The couple split in December 2015 and Yolanda left Los Angeles to start over in New York and to be closer to her three children Gigi, Bella and Anwar Hadid. Despite going through heartbreak and devastating loss in the midst of failing health, Yolanda says she has no bad feelings towards her ex husband.
“I had a great seven year run with him and I will always hold that I high regards and have gratitude for that time together,” she says. “If he didn’t leave the marriage I would not be where I am today.”

Brad & Jen Back Together! Pitt & Aniston To Meet Up In TV Tell-All/n
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are reuniting, if Jimmy Kimmel has any say in the matter!
The talk show host wants to make history and get Pitt, 53, and Aniston, 48, on his program to do a joint interview — and an insider told Radar the chances of it happening are “pretty good.”
Kimmel, 49, “is super close to Jen, but he’s also really good friends with Pitt disciples Peter Dante and David Fincher,” says an insider of the actor and the director.

To get the ball rolling on his grand plan, “Jimmy sent a message to Brad that he’s a welcome presence at the show, even just to hang out in the bar area backstage and schmooze,” noted the insider.
“Brad is a priority for Jimmy. He wants his show to be Brad’s first stop from now on,” continued the insider, who notes that the talk show host believes the time is right for Pitt and Aniston to appear in public since the actor has been showing a “softening stance toward the whole Jen drama.”
And it doesn’t hurt that Pitt and Aniston’s arch-nemesis, Angelina Jolie, are no longer together following their shocking split last September.

“Brad’s free of Angelina, and Jimmy thinks he can make this happen,” the insider told Radar. “He’s really tight with Jen and she trusts him.”
Just how Justin Theroux feels about a possible reunion between his wife and her ex remains to be seen.
Regardless, “Jimmy will indeed be making TV history if he can pull this one off.”

"Kids this age are amazingly resilient, and the very close bond that Britney has with her children is apparent, " according to a source. Including yesterday's visit, Brit and the boys have had four visits together since K-Daddy and Mama B came to an agreement on Feb. 22.   Nicole Can Sing and Dance? Yeah, her dad is Lionel Richie, but since when can Nicole Richie carry a Broadway show?According to Us Weekly, Mama Nic has been offered the lead role of Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of Chicago, and a pal tells the mag,  "She's definitely interested and weighing it out with the timing of the baby. It is in the super early stages of discussions and no decision has been made yet. "But now that baby daddy Joel Madden has a pad in NYC and baby Harlow is getting past newborn stages, it could happen. Ashlee Simpson and Lisa Rinna have also taken the role.

Bruce Willis Tells Freeman's He Abandoned His Son TMZ spies spotted Andy Dick at trendy Mathis Murphy salon in Venice Beach wanting a haircut without anappointment -- and then signing his autograph all over the shop's magazines. No word if they were subsequently drenched in Barbasol. ... Even though the Beatles will be featured on  "American Idol, " and Michael Jackson owns half of the Beatles' catalog, it still won't be enough to help save Neverland from the auction block, says FOX News. ... Bruce Willis was at downtown boite Freeman's with his new galpal, says Gatecrasher, but kept bellowing out in the small dining room,  "I've abandoned my son!

episode, slated to air in January, Pratt will play Nick, a charming horseback riding instructor who Christy (Faris) takes a liking to. One problem? He's Marjorie's (Mimi Kennedy) nephew, and she's declared him off limits! EW f.../n
When searching for Christy's love interest in an upcoming episode of Mom's new season, star Anna Faris didn't have to look far.Her real-life husband Chris Pratt has found some available time in his busy blockbuster-movie-making schedule and agreed to guest star in an episode later in season four, E! News has confirmed. The appearance marks the superstar's first TV role since Parks and Recreation went off the air in 2015.In the episode, slated to air in January, Pratt will play Nick, a charming horseback riding instructor who Christy (Faris) takes a liking to. One problem? He's Marjorie's (Mimi Kennedy) nephew, and she's declared him off limits!EW first reported the news.

While the guest star spot is Pratt's first time appearing on his wife's show since its debut in 2013, it's hardly the first time they've shared the screen together. Beginning with 2011's Take Me Home Tonight, they've appeared in a total of three film together. The others? What's Your Number (also in 2011) and Movie 43 (2012).While the appearance on Mom is his first TV spot since Parks and Rec ended, Pratt has kept busy. Up next on the big screen are sci-fi romance Passengers with Jennifer Lawrence later this year and the highly-anticipated Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in the summer of 2017.

Pratt's addition to Mom is the latest in a series of big swings the CBS comedy is making in its fourth season. A mini The West Wing reunion is on the way with Bradley Whitford stopping by to act opposite Allison Janney (who plays Christy's mom, Bonnie). There's also a very special episode involving Christy's young son Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal) coming up where the kid is caught smoking his first joint.Are you as excited for Chris Pratt on Mom as we are? Sound off in the comments below.Mom returns for season four on Thursday, Oct. 27 at 9 p.m. on CBS.

Maybe all Verne Troyer ever wanted was a little more say in the matter.The diminutive actor has settled the $20 million lawsuit that he filed last month against TMZ.com, an adult film distributor and celebrity porn broker Kevin Blatt after a clip of a sex tape he made with a former girlfriend was posted on the celebrity-gossip site.Troyer attorney Edwin McPherson said Friday that his client never plans on selling the tape, but Blatt and online renter SugarDVD signed agreements requiring the Love Guru sidekick's permission before they are ever allowed to further promote or profit from the video.

McPherson said he will also try to amend the suit Monday to include Troyer's ex, Ranae Shrider, among those who need to check with the actor first before peddling the tape. Other individuals or companies might end up finding themselves at the wrong end of a lawsuit, as well, to further ensure that this X-rated romp remains under wraps, McPherson added.After granting Troyer a temporary restraining order on June 27 to halt the airing of his sexcapades, a federal judge allowed TMZ to repost the footage after Shrider, an aspiring actress, admitted to leaking the home movie.The order against SugarDVD and Blatt was extended about a week later at Troyer's request as settlement talks kicked off between the opposing sides."We achieved our goal," McPherson told reporters today.While Shrider apparently wasn't fazed by the idea of a little indecent exposure, Troyer exclusively told E! News this week that it was the invasion of privacy that had him fighting so hard to get this tape under wraps."Just because people are seeing something that was meant to be between me and  her. That's the biggest reason that I'm, you know, trying to stop the tape from  being released."I broke up with her in the middle of June; it was something probably to do with  that. It was basically when she decided to give the tape away. I highly doubt  that she thought that would get me back with her. Ransom or something," he said.

Kendall Jenner Accused of Not Leaving a Tip Leads Today’s Star Sightings/n





                    Kendall Jenner Rocks Only a Skimpy Red Thong in Topless Photo Shoot
                







DAYUM!

Kendall Jenner is in hot water with the wait staff at a famous Brooklyn bar.

According to the people at Baby’s All Right, the 21-year-old model failed to leave a tip when she went to out partying at the Williamsburg hotspot. Though the establishment didn’t necessarily call out the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star by name, they did share a photo of a receipt signed by one “Kendall N. Jenner” for a $24 bill on Instagram. (For the record: Jenner’s middle name is Nicole.)
“Don’t forget to tip your bartender,” the bar captioned along with a presumably passive aggressive smiley face.




A post shared by Baby's All Right (@babysallright) on Aug 4, 2017 at 12:35pm PDT



While it’s still unconfirmed if the credit card holder in question is the reality star, internet sleuths point out the timeline fits as Kendall was spotted attending a concert in New York City Thursday and her rumored boyfriend, A$AP Rocky, performed at an album release party at Baby’s All Right that night.
The morning after, she was photographed catching a flight out of town at the John F. Kennedy Airport. Guess that bar won’t get their money now.

You’re going to want to write these down.

We already know Chrissy Teigen is your favorite celebrity chef, therefore you’ve already bought her book “Cravings” and tried out half of the recipes. But even a master (home) chef like Teigen doesn’t want to cook every night, so when she’s not busy being the soup master or making her out of this world chicken lettuce wraps, she’s got a few staple dishes at her favorite restaurants that she’s always in the mood to eat. And because Teigen is basically the internet’s BFF, she went ahead and shared the priceless information with everyone, and now we’ll never cook again. From five star restaurants to drive-throughs, Teigen’s got a favorite food for everyone.

‘The Voice’ Mentor Luke Bryan Shares Heartbreak Over Brother’s Tragic Death/n
Luke Bryan is revealing how he came to terms with brother’s sudden death in an unbelievable tell-all, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The country crooner, 40, told TODAY host Willie Geist that he was just 19-years-old when his brother Chris died in a car accident — and he had to push through the pain to achieve his success.
“It just totally rocked our family’s world, rocked my world,” he confessed. “It makes you appreciate chasing dreams, you know. You’re like, hey you get one go-round at this thing called life and it’s very fragile, so you better go after your dreams.”
PHOTOS: 10 Shocking & Unexpected Celebrity Deaths
But, Bryan failed to mention how his sister Kelly’s death affected him in the brief clip1
Kelly died suddenly in 2007, and her widow, Ben Lee Cheshire, died seven years later. Luke and his wife Caroline have been raising their son, Til, as their own ever since.
He opened up in a 20/20 interview about the deaths, saying: “My only older siblings … gone from the world, in a flash in two, two different, crazy, tragic manners, that … we’ll never know, and never understand.”

Caitlyn Jenner -- I Want My Whole Family at the ESPYs, Except .../nCaitlyn Jenner has invited her entire family to be by her side when she receives the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs Wednesday night, with the exception of her 3 ex-wives. Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson and Kris Jenner will not be attending the ceremony, and it makes sense. We're told Caitlyn wants her family there, and the exes are not family anymore. As one Caitlyn source put it,  "Her ex-wives don't celebrate Father's Day. Fact is, they're just not her family, but the kids are. " And the kids will be there in force ... Kim, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie. Brody, Burt and Cassandra will also be at the ceremony, but Brandon is up in the air because his wife, Leah, is about to give birth. Caitlyn's mom and sister will be in attendance too.  Then there's Rob Kardashian ... we're told he's definitely invited, but it doesn't look good because he's shunned every public appearance for more than a year. /n

Kennedys' Summer Play Land Was A Drug-Ridden Hell's Cape!/n
The Kennedys unknowingly lived alongside two wannabe mafios who used their Hyannisport compound as their own drug den to peddle heroin and fentanyl to the well-heeled!
Troy Monteiro and Trevor Gonsalves-Rose were charged with trafficking in fentanyl and cocaine in January after Barnstable, Mass. police conducted an investigation into the men’s suspicious behavior.
“The investigation established that Monteiro and Gonsalves-Rose were traveling from New Bedford, MA to Hyannis, MA for the purpose of selling heroin/fentanyl,” the statement of facts obtained by RadarOnline.com read.
PHOTOS: Remembering the Kennedys
“On numerous occasions, Detectives observed Monteiro walk onto the beach and appear to hide/bury objects in the sand near landmarks such as retaining walls, benches, docks, and signposts,” the document continued. “Monteiro would depart the are and return later to retrieve the objects. Often times this would occur in between meeting with customers in the parking lot of the beach and other nearby locations.”
“Detectives suspected that Monteiro and Gonsalves-Rose were using the relatively uninhabited beach area as a location to store redistribution amounts of drugs which were readily accessible to deal to their customer base,” it added.
READ THE SHOCKING DOCUMENTS
Detectives followed the men over the course of four days and seized over 130 grams of fentanyl and 2 grams of cocaine.
They also reported that Monteiro used the Hyannisport Yacht Club to store his drugs one day.
The police were able to execute a search warrant at the end of January and found “5 individual baggies containing approximately 4 grams of suspected fentanyl/heroin, 20,000 dollars in U.S. currency, a digital scale, and the identification of Monteiro and [Ariel ] Price-Perry.” Price-Perry’s relation to Monteiro is still unknown.

They went to arrest Monteiro the next day, and he attempted to “flee on foot.” Price-Perry was driving the car he was caught in, and threw a cell phone out of the car when she was approached.
Rose was arrested “following a motor vehicle stop in Hyannisport.”

Radar previously reported that the 29-year-olds are now facing jail time, and were due in court this month.
The Kennedys began vacationing in Massachusetts in 1926, and now own three homes spanning six acres along the Nantucket Sound. Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her brother, President John F. Kennedy spent their childhood summers at the compound, and Taylor Swift bought the property across Bobby and Ethel Kennedy‘s compound home after dating Connor Kennedy.

Obama's appearance on Between Two Ferns is another attempt to encourage young people to sign up for health insurance before March 31.But when the Affordable Care Act was brought up, Galifianakis remarked, "Yeah. I heard about that. That's the thing that doesn't work."Later, after Obama noted that the act "can't discriminate against you if you have a pre-existing condition anymore," Galifianakis rolled up his sleeve and showed his "spider bites.""Zach, you need to get that checked right away," Obama said. "You need to get on healthcare.gov because that's one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen."Fortunately for us, this interview was one of the funniest things we've seen.

Lamar Odom Says It’s “Best” Not to Get Back Together with Khloé Kardashian/n





                    Khloé Kardashian Fears Lamar Odom Will Relapse
                







Things aren't looking good.

Lamar Odom has given up on his quest to win back ex-wife Khloé Kardashian.

The former NBA star, who finalized his divorce with the reality star in December after seven years of marriage, told Wendy Williams this week it’s “best” they don’t reconcile. When asked if he would marry Khloé again if she came back into his life right now, Lamar bluntly replied, “No.”
“I say with no offense to her,” he explained. “That would be the best for both of us.”





Lamar revealed he has also severed ties with Rob Kardashian, who he lived with for two years. Though he’s fine with not reconnecting with Khloé, the 37-year-old admitted he misses spending time with his former brother-in-law.
“We were close,” he shared, adding he considered Rob as a “brother.”
Lamar quipped, “He has a child. I haven’t met his child yet.”
Getting visibly emotional, Lamar said he understood why Rob wouldn’t want to remain friends — given all the trouble he’s caused the Kardashian family with his past substance abuse. “If she was my [sister], I’d have a problem with me too,” he reasoned.





Khloé first filed a divorce petition back in 2013, but withdrew it after Lamar suffered a health crisis when he overdosed at a Nevada brothel. She filed for divorce once again in May 2016. Since then, Khloé has been dating Cleveland Cavaliers’ Tristan Thompson.
Earlier this year, Lamar admitted to cheating on Khloé throughout their marriage and apologized for his drug problem. “To my family and to Khloé, I just want to say that I’m sorry for all of that wasted time and wasted energy,” he said on The Doctors. “In my addiction, I just didn’t know what I was. I couldn’t take care of myself. I damn sure couldn’t take care of anyone else.”

Bomber jackets have been taking over the fashion world and rightfully so. 
These jackets are a trend that everyone should be following. Easily thrown over any outfit, bomber jackets give your outfit that additional spark of style. They are suitable for anyone’s fashion sense, as they can be worn dressed up, dressed down or anywhere in between.
Most commonly worn bombers come in neutral colors like black, white, navy, and olive green. These bombers can be styled with a basic t-shirt and jeans to give off the casual-chic vibes.

// <![CDATA[
!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1476204089134?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');
// ]]>


Some bombers step outside of their ordinary color palette with an unexpected assortment of colors like pink, purple, orange and more.

// <![CDATA[
!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1476204089134?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');
// ]]>


Some retailers incorporate embroidery to their outerwear designs. The embroidered accents of writing, flowers, or even animals can dress up the common bomber. There are also different patterns and patches to help your bomber stand out from the rest.

// <![CDATA[
!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1476204089134?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');
// ]]>


Mesh, velvet, tweed, and denim are some materials being used in the making of bomber jackets. Abandoning the classic material that bomber jackets are made of which is mainly nylon or satin, these bomber jackets play with the textures of their outerwear.

// <![CDATA[
!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1476204089134?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');
// ]]>


In addition to changing materials, some bomber jackets stand out by the difference in their length. Most bombers end at the hip, while others extend to knee length and even longer.

// <![CDATA[
!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1476204089134?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');

How gorgeous is this family?!

Kate Middleton and Prince William brought along their adorable kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, when they touched down in Warsaw Monday (July 17th). Kicking off their five-day tour of Poland and Germany, the royal couple were all smiles as they greeted fans and held hands with their children on the tarmac.
George, 3, and Charlotte, 2, were seen wearing matching red details in honor of Poland’s national colors.

Later that day, Kate joked about expanding the clan again when she was presented with gifts for her children. “We will just have to have more babies,” she was overheard telling William, according to the Daily Mail.
“We gave the Duchess some presents for Prince George and Princess Charlotte,” Polish fashion house founder Julia Sielicka-Jastrzebska told the publication. “She said they should have more babies, and they laughed.”

Twitter Has Something To Say About Trump's Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci Quoting Disgraced Joe Paterno!/n

Once again, you just really can't make this stuff up.
As the White House Communications Director, you'd think Anthony Scaramucci would know better than to name drop Joe Paterno — the disgraced football coaching legend who was fired from Penn State for his role in the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal — when talking about "honor" and "dignity."
But, here we are.
On Thursday, Scaramucci called into CNN's New Day where he went on a rant suggesting his financial disclosure report was leaked, even though it was public information.
Related: Sean Spicer's Post-White House Gig May Be Dancing With The Stars
Donald Trump's adviser said: 
"Remember Joe Paterno? What would he say? ‘Act like you've been there before.' Act with honor and dignity and respect and hold the confidence of the presidency in his office."
All of us:

Wanna know the best part?
"Act like you've been there before" is originally a Vince Lombardi (NOT JoePa) quote! LOLz!
Ch-ch-check out Twitter's confused reactions (below)!!

Anthony Scaramucci just positively quoted Joe Paterno–who, you know, condoned the rape of children–as a way of responding to criticism. 🙃
— Charles Clymer🏳️‍🌈 (@cmclymer) July 27, 2017


Of course, Anthony Scaramucci cited Joe Paterno as someone to emulate:
Let's just hope the Trump Admin has the same happy ending. pic.twitter.com/NoCTDmOg1R
— The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) July 27, 2017


Scaramucci quoting Joe Paterno makes sense since his job for the foreseeable future will be covering up the wrongdoings of his coworkers
— Juggalocialism (@UweBollocks) July 27, 2017


Yesterday Gooch compared Trump's effort to overturn ACA to Lincoln abolishing slavery, today he quoted Joe Paterno in reference to 'honor'.
— BONGER (@jerweber) July 27, 2017


Anthony @Scaramucci says the White House staff should have the honor of Joe Paterno.
Frankly I think they already do.
— UndeadPaterno (@UndeadPaterno) July 27, 2017


You know the dumbest part about Scaramucci's "Joe Paterno" gaffe? "Act like you've been there before" is a VINCE LOMBARDI line.
— Use Your Collusion I (@Notintheface1) July 27, 2017


This isn't even a Joe Paterno quote. It's been said by both Vince Lombardi and Bear Bryant.
— Karisa Maxwell (@KarisaMaxwell) July 27, 2017


So White House Communications Director used a quote from Joe Paterno about honor and dignity. pic.twitter.com/alRITOsyfT
— John C. Varner III (@LilHulkQ) July 27, 2017


It's fitting how Scaramucci quotes Joe Paterno who was the same man that protected a sexual predator like he now is paid to protect Trump pic.twitter.com/ZHMDk7wUf1
— CeCe On-Air 🎙 (@ceceonair) July 27, 2017


The irony of @Scaramucci quoting Joe Paterno about honor isn't being lost here, is it?
— TheJazzyUte (@TheJazzyUte) July 27, 2017


Scaramucci really quoted freaking Joe Paterno about honor. This is really the stupidest of times.pic.twitter.com/lAhlm2kgq7
— Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) July 27, 2017


White House believes good employees keep secrets the same way Joe Paterno protected sexual abusers of kids. Got it. pic.twitter.com/poxPb3QeO0
— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) July 27, 2017


But if officials who keep their mouth shut are like Joe Paterno that means DT is Sandusky which means the working/middle class ppl are… oh

We have a bad feeling about this one.Yes, tonight's season six premiere of The Walking Dead was epic, what with more walkers on screen than ever before. And yes, it left us with one doozy of a cliffhanger when Rick's plan to herd said walkers far away was destroyed by whoever sounded the alarm back home in Alexandria. But, you guys, where the heck was Carl? The little guy wasn't seen or heard from once during the 90 minute episode, and no one even mentioned his name. That can't be good.

Could it just be that Rick (Andrew Lincoln) chose to keep his son out of harms way as he and the rest of the group attempted to move the walkers in the quarry, en masse, out of close proximity to Alexandria? It's a possibility, someone's got to look after Judith, after all. But as we watched so many Alexandrians struggle to get battle ready (Ethan Embry, we hardly knew ye!), doesn't it seem like Carl (Chandler Riggs) could've been of some use?Carl's whereabouts weren't all we were screaming at our TVs, demanding answers about, though. No, there's the little mystery of who in their right mind was sounding that alarm, thereby luring the massive horde of walkers right to the walls of the compound—and why. That's got to be some desperate measures reasoning in a world where sound will lure death to your doorstep. For the who, we're guessing Father Gabriel. All terrible things tend to be his fault.For the why: We know the Wolves are on their way, we saw them catch wise of Alexandria last season. Could they have been laying in wait, ready to storm the gates once Rick and his crew were far enough away? That's where we're placing our bet. After all, Lauren Cohan (Maggie) did tell E! News: "Come very soon after this first episode, we're really gonna need as much manpower as we can get."Fingers crossed they've got it.What did you think of the premiere? Are you as worried about Carl as we are? And who do you think rang the alarm bells? Sound off in the comments below!The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC.

Whitney Houston Would 'Feel Like A Total Failure' Over Nick Gordon Abuse Arrest/n
Whitney Houston believed that Nick Gordon would turn his life around before Bobbi Kristina Brown’s tragic death and the recent abuse allegation from his new girlfriend, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
“Whitney is surely turning over in her grave,” a music industry source reveals to Radar. “She knew better than anybody that Nick had his demons, but Whitney thought she could somehow love the pain away. Whitney trusted Nick with her daughter’s life, and look where that got Krissi.”
“Whitney would feel like a total failure seeing how Nick turned out,” the insider added. “She treated him as a son and before she died she knew Krissi and Nick had a special bond that was growing into something more intense.”
PHOTOS: Nick Gordon Reveals Chilling New Details About Bobbi Kristina’s Death
But as Radar previously reported, their relationship ended when Gordon, 27, found Brown face down in a bathtub in January 2015. She died in July 2015 shortly after she turned 22 years old.
Gordon was found legally responsible for her death after he failed to appear in court twice in her wrongful death lawsuit.
“Nick has always had a horrendous temper, even when he was younger,” the insider added. “Whitney was even scared of him.”
PHOTOS: Bobbi Kristina Brown Betrayed! Nick Gordon Steps Out With New Girl
His temper may have got the best of him on June 10 when he was arrested for battery and false imprisonment of his new girlfriend, Laura Leal. Leal claimed he pinned her and punched her until she thought she was dead, but he was granted a $15,500 bond in the matter.
“Nick has got serious psychological and substance abuse issues,” the insider concluded. “Whitney and Krissi’s family are living through their hellish nightmare all over again.”

What Created A Monster? Inside The Life Of Batman Shooter James Holmes /n
By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
As the days pass since the shooting tragedy during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, more disturbing details have emerged about suspect James Holmes‘ life both before and after he opened fire on a movie theater full of Colorado film-goers in the early hours of Friday morning. 
If the dazed expression and dyed orange hair of the mass killer when he appeared in court on Monday wasn’t bizarre enough, it has now been revealed that the 24-year-old used evidence bags as hand puppets when police interviewed him after his arrest.
PHOTOS: Celebs Involved In Murder
While sitting wide-eyed, twitching and eerily detached in the interrogation room, detectives put plastic bags over the shooter’s hands to preserve gunshot residue, but instead of taking it seriously The Joker dopelganger began playing with them as if they were a pair of puppets, according to CALL7 in Denver.
Despite his spaced out demeanor, Holmes didn’t let his hostile surroundings or the guilt of killing 12 people and injuring 58 others disturb his appetite or his sleep pattern, acording to the New York Post, who learned from a jail worker that he wolfed down Frosted Flakes, a carton of milk and a blueberry muffin for breakfast, then slept like a baby.
PHOTOS:  Celebs Who Have Done Jail Time
According to reports, the neuroscience school dropout was adopted by parents Arlene and Robert Holmes, who made a request for privacy through their lawyer on Monday. 
However neighbors and close friends of the Rancho Penasquitos, Calif., couple have revealed that James’ mother was very concerned about her son’s social isolation and had sought counseling for him years earlier, reported the Washington Post.
PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots
The former PhD student’s withdrawn nature was a stark contrast to the outgoing personality of his sister, Chris, who at five years younger was a gregarious and sociable teenager with a tomboy streak and a passion for playing guitar.
Meanwhile, Batman fanatic Holmes is thought to have spent the past four months planning the plot of his own grisly horror film by stocking up bullets and bulletproof gear, and building bombs and wire traps.

Holmes is being held without bond and will hear the formal charges against him next Monday. The County District Attorney is considering whether to seek the death penalty.

 Jill Duggar & Husband Derick Ditch Dangerous Central America Mission After Two Years.../n
Jill Duggar and her husband Derick Dillard have come under fire over the past two years for their mission work in Central America. After a friend’s murder, Zika fears and more, the Counting On stars are finally returning to Arkansas for good.
Jill and Derick, who are parents to young sons Israel and Samuel, broke the news on their blog.
“Through a number of circumstances, and guided by much prayer and counsel, we are discerning the Lord leading our family’s full-time ministry back to the United States for the time being,” the post read. “We understand very well that mission work definitely requires flexibility. This, we have witnessed and experienced first-hand in our years of ministry.”

The post continued, “It is, and always has been our aim, to seek the Lord above all else. This includes walking in close relationship with Him daily, seeking His direction for our family, and doing our absolute best in everything, namely, being a Gospel witness and Kingdom worker in whatever context He places us.”
Their departure comes after they have been highly criticized for the last two years for putting their children in danger.
In October 2016, Jill revealed how dangerous living in Central America with their son Israel has been.
PHOTOS: Secret Heartbreak! Inside Anna Duggar’s ‘Major’ Family Tragedy & Traumas
“Every week, it seems like there would be different instances because Derick would preach one night a week a little distance from our house, so I would be at home alone with Israel,” Jill said. “One night, we were getting ready to go to bed, and we heard this loud crashing sound.

In February, they received backlash for living in El Salvador while Jill was pregnant with their youngest son Samuel.
The New York Times reported that El Salvador advised women in the country to not get pregnant until 2018. The mosquito-borne virus has been linked to brain damage in babies.

Terrell Owens Asks Ice Cube For A Spot In BIG3 League, Seriously/nListen up Ice Cube, one of the greatest athletes of all time is about to ask you for a gig ... Terrell Owens, who is publicly asking Cube for a shot at hoops glory in the BIG3 league. It's no secret Owens is a baller, his exploits in different leagues and charity games are well documented on Youtube, but when we talked to him, he told us he wants to try it on the pro level.  "I tried to get into that league. I gotta get Ice Cube's number to get my name in the hat to get on one of those teams. " The rub? The BIG3 league has been billed as primarily for ex-NBA and other professional BASKETBALL players to try their hand at. T.O. of course starred in the NFL. That didn't stop him from making an impassioned plea to try his hand alongside Allen Iverson, Rashad McCants, Rashard Lewis and Kwame Brown, and it's clear he's 100% serious. Come on Ice Cube ... SOMEBODY has got to let this man in (shame on you Hall Of Fame)./n
 Celeb Gambling Ring Members Fear They've Been CAUGHT On Wiretaps Making Illegal Bets,.../n
The take down of a mafia run gambling ring in New York City threatens to trap a gaggle of high-profile celebrities who a source claims may have been caught on wiretaps making illegal bets, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.
Thirteen members and associates of the Genovese Organized Crime Family were nabbed in the Dec. 15 bust, which included Vincent “Vinny” Taliercio, a long-time Brooklyn bookie who collected wagers from a Who’s Who of Hollywood elite, a well-placed source told Radar.
The list of New York City born celebs may include: The Godfather star James Caan; Taxi actor Tony Danza and Paul Sorvino, who played a mafia boss in the wise guy drama Goodfellas, the source told Radar.
“James Caan is a big gambler — he bets on anything. He’ll even bet on which elevator doors open first,” the insider claimed.
PHOTOS: Banged Up! Charlie CAUGHT With Mysterious Bandages On His Wrist & Knee
Some of the other high profile gamblers may include: Bronx born TV talker Regis Philbin; Two and Half Men star Charlie Sheen; the late Law & Order star Jerry Orbach; Seinfeld co-creator Larry David; the late Wise Guy actor Ray Sharkey and famed producer James L. Brooks, an Oscar winning director, and Ed Weinberger, who both created Taxi and numerous other television classics.
“They probably caught some of these celebrities on the wiretaps,” the source said, adding the gamblers would usually place their bets with Vinny by telephone if they weren’t in New York.
“Vinnie is not just a bookie — everybody who is anybody in the gambling world would call him up because he’s the best handicapper in the world,” the source told Radar. “He has dealt with all the big celebrities.”
“Everybody went to Vinny for advice even the members of all five crime families. Anything you needed to know about sports that guy Vinny knew about it — he was like a walking encyclopedia — an almanac!”

Vinny was arrested during the gambling and loansharking investigation dubbed “Operation Shark Bait” by the New York Attorney General’s Office’s Organized Crime Task Force and the NYPD’s Criminal Enterprise Investigations Section, who used wiretaps to secure the indictments.
The ringleader Salvatore “Sallie” DeMeo, 76, and the others are accused of running the gambling site 4Spades.orgbased in Costa Rica along with a lucrative loansharking and illegal cigarette smuggling business that raked in millions, according to a 56-page indictment obtained by Radar.
Vinny, who operated his family owned grocery store, the Smith Union Market in Brooklyn, “served as the money collector/distributor of illegal gambling proceeds,” according to the indictment.

In one chat tape recorded on Feb. 14, 2015, Vinny is heard giving the spread to college games: “Michigan State’s two-and-a-half, 37-and-a-half, Clemson is nine, no total. Xavier is eight and 48.”
The celebs relied on Vinny for gambling advice and enjoyed betting on college basketball and football games because they “enjoyed the spread,” the inside source told Radar.
According to the source, they also gambled on professional sports, boxing and horse races — a favorite of the Brooklyn born Sorvino, who also starred on the television series Law & Order.
Some sports superstars who placed bets with Vinny include: Yankee great Mickey Mantle, disgraced hitting champ Pete Rose and famed L.A. Dodgers’ manager Tommy Lasorda.
Vinny plead not guilty in Brooklyn Criminal Court and was released on a $20,000. He scheduled back in court on February 15th.

 Timeline Of Trouble: Taye Diggs Caught Paryting With Other Women In Months Before Split.../n
In April of this year, Idina Menzel opened up about going through “tough times” in her ten-year marriage to Taye Diggs. Though the couple insisted things were fine, apparently it only got tougher after that, and they announced they were separating earlier this week. Now, RadarOnline.com can reveal that after a major cheating scandal this summer, Diggs was spotted partying with several other women in the months before his divorce from his wife.
This summer, Star magazine claimed that Diggs was “spotted getting frisky with a sexy brunette [who was not his wife] while partying at Emerson nightclub in Hollywood on June 19.” Just over a week later, another source told the mag, Diggs was seen “acting like a bachelor” at another Hollywood hotspot on June 30. His rep denied it at the time, but Radar has learned that his seemingly single behavior continued for the next several months.
On September 3, Diggs was spotted hanging out on a banquette with Mad Men star Christina Hendricks at the opening night party for Broadway play “Everything Is Ours,” which Diggs did not appear in. Happily laughing with other partygoers, Diggs didn’t seem to be missing his wife, who was across town at the US Open with her father.

Just over one week later, Menzel was nowhere to be seen again as Diggs chatted and posed for pictures with stunning actress Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon at a pre-Emmys party in L.A. on September 13. Menzel stayed in NYC for a fitting for her new musical, If/Then.
On October 6, he cozied up to a hot blonde at a “Harry’s,” a college bar in Syracuse, New York, where he attended school. He was in town for homecoming festivities, and was spotted posing with female fans at the game as well, while Menzel was nowhere to be seen.


Homecoming was a success. I met Taye Diggs! 

And perhaps most shockingly, Menzel was totally M.I.A. at the November 6 premiere of Diggs’ holiday film, The Best Man Holiday. He walked the red carpet with sexy co-star Sanaa Lathan, and certainly wasn’t hurting for company at the after-party, where he happily posed for photos with a group of gorgeous women, including publicist Michelle Pascal, beauty expert Danielle Gray, singer Taren Guy, and writer Andrea Arterbery. Menzel was in a preview performance for If/Then in NYC.

Back in New York on December 6, Diggs rolled solo yet again as he left a show in New York, stopping to pose with a fan for a quick pic.

— Betsy♥ (@Blabo94) December 6, 2013

Just a few laters, the couple announced that they were calling it quits. “Idina Menzel and Taye Diggs have jointly decided to separate at this time,” reps for the couple announced. “Their primary focus and concern is for their son [Walker, 4]. We ask that you respect their privacy during this time.” /n

 Secret Shame: Bruce Jenner 'Suffered In Silence' For Years Over Sexual Identity, Keeping.../n
Bruce Jenner is finally ready to reveal his transformation plans to the world, but RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that it was a long and lonely road to this point. Insiders say the reality show star “suffered in silence” for years, and was never able to confide in his close friends about his true identity.
His own mother, Esther Jenner, told Radar that he only recently told her about his process, and close friends say he kept them in the dark as well.

“Bruce never mentioned for all of these years that he wanted to live as a woman,” a source close to the 65-year-old athlete told Radar. “Everyone would have been supportive if he had said anything, but he really kept it close to his chest. He basically suffered in silence, which is really a shame because he didn’t have to at all. And his friends feel guilty now for not trying to help him before.”
Now, Jenner is preparing to tell all during a sit-down interview with Diane Sawyer, as Radar has reported. But despite the bombshell news, his friends will stick by him.
“This won’t change how anyone feels about Bruce,” the source said. “He’s a good guy and his friends will be on his side, whether he’s a man or a woman.” /n

Clueless writer Amy Heckerling wants Katy Perry to star in the staged musical remake of the '90s classic, and we don't blame her. The singer is Heckerling's top pick to play Cher Horowitz according to Vulture. Heckerling notes, she may pine for Perry, "But you never know what will happen, she has a whole big schedule. It was like I love it, I wish I could do it." Um, same. Sure the jet-black, short hair she's been sporting as of late doesn't exactly scream, "Oh my God, I love Josh," but with a little makeup magic we know she could pull off the role. Look at them both killing that red tartan! 

Speaking of magic, Jezebel notes the film's original costume designer, Mona May, will be back to dress the cast once more. We have a feeling Katy won't need that much help in the wardrobe department, though. Her Cher-inspired outfits are always on point. So much so we put together a list of the five times Katy nailed Cher's iconic look, proving she's meant for the part. Katy, if you're reading this, we hope this convinces you to say yes to the (white, Calvin Klein) dress.

No Monets in sight. No one can pull off the classic school girl look as well as these two. Blazers, printed skirts and knee-high socks aren't just for boring school uniforms anymore. 

Sporting jerseys for imaginary sports teams: so hot right now. 

We're loving that Cher had a little bit of a fashion dark side to her, something Katy rocks all too well. Isn't there a musical version of The Craft out there, too? These ladies need to audition. 

If you can hashtag werk this classic Clueless outfit, you can rock them all. Watch out Iggy Azalea, Katy stunned with her modern-day interpretation of Cher's iconic yellow plaid. We're loving the choice to pair it with a leather bustier. We're getting serious Delia's catalog vibes right now.

May Leonard Nimoy continue to live long and prosper.The Star Trek star was reportedly hospitalized with chest pains last week, but he was up and tweeting yesterday and today, each message tagged with his trademark "LLAP" sign-off.The Los Angeles Fire Department confirms to E!

Due to privacy regulations, officials would not disclose the patient's identity.

A rep for Nimoy could not immediately be reached for comment. TMZ reported that he was taken to UCLA Medical Center.Just over a year ago, the now 83-year-old actor revealed that he had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after he was photographed in a wheelchair and with with an oxygen tube in his nose at the airport."I quit smoking 30 years ago.

Chester Bennington’s Widow Speaks Out After Shock Suicide: ‘How Do I Move On?’/n
Just eight days after the shocking suicide of Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington, his devastated widow, Talinda Bennington has spoken on in grief, RadarOnlien.com can report.
“One week ago, I lost my soul mate and my children lost their hero ­– their Daddy. We had a fairytale life and now it has turned into some sick Shakespearean tragedy,” she shared in a statement via Twitter.
The heartbroken mother-of-three continued: “How do I move on? How do I pick up my shattered soul? The only answer I know is to raise our babies with every ounce of love I have left.”

As Radar can reveal, the former Playboy model – who married Chester in 2006 – shares kids Lily, 6, Lila, 6, and Tyler, 11, with the late musician. He is survived by three more of his children from previous relationships.

“I want to let my community and the fans worldwide know that we feel your love. We feel your loss as well. My babies are so young to have lost their daddy. And I know that all of you will help keep his memory alive,” added Talinda.
Speaking of her deceased husband who took his own life at age 41, she wrote: He “was a bright, loving soul with an angel’s voice. And now he is pain-free singing his songs in all of our hearts.”
As Radar previously reported, Chester suffered from severe depression and substance abuse. His anxiety worsened after his pal Chris Cornell abruptly hung himself – a death which Chester allegedly modeled his own suicide after.
“May God bless us all and help us turn to one another when we are in pain. Chester would’ve wanted us to do so,” said Talinda.

Chester took his own life on late pal Cornell’s birthday.
Wrote his widow: “Rest in peace, my love.”
Chester’s bandmates – Rob Bourdon, Brad Delson, Dave Farrell, Joe Hahn and Mike Shinoda – spoke out after his suicide, saying: “The shockwaves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened.”
“You touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized. In the past few days, we’ve seen an outpouring of love and support, both public and private, from around the world. Talinda and the family appreciate it, and want the world to know that you were the best husband, son, and father; the family will never be whole without you,” stated his pals.
Linkin Park cancelled their North America tour after Chester’s death.

“Talking with you about the years ahead together, your excitement was infectious. Your absence leaves a void that can never be filled—a boisterous, funny, ambitious, creative, kind, generous voice in the room is missing,” they added.
The devastated bandmates continues sharing their immense grief after Chester’s unexpected passing, saying they were sad to think about the dark demons that corrupted his mind during his finals days.
“We’re trying to remind ourselves that the demons who took you away from us were always part of the deal. After all, it was the way you sang about those demons that made everyone fall in love with you in the first place. You fearlessly put them on display, and in doing so, brought us together and taught us to be more human. You had the biggest heart, and managed to wear it on your sleeve. Our love for making and performing music is inextinguishable. While we don’t know what path our future may take, we know that each of our lives was made better by you. Thank you for that gift. We love you, and miss you so much,” they said.

Teresa Giudice -- Sentenced to Prison for 15 Months/nTeresa Giudice has just been sentenced to prison for 15 months ... she was hysterical, but it could have been a lot worse for her.She will begin serving the sentence January 5.  She'll complete her sentence and then Joe will begin his.Teresa made a plea to the judge to give her house arrest instead of time behind bars so she could care for her kids. Her husband Joe will spend 41 months behind bars, and she says their 4 kids will have to be split up among their relatives if they both serve.But the judge said the sentences would be staggered, so when one is in prison, the other can perform parental duties.Before sentencing ... Teresa begged the judge for leniency, saying she is in a deep depression and her life is now ruined.  She says all she cares about is her kids and she has no interest anymore in TV shows.She also said she didn't care about handbags ... a reference to the fact that she was photographed last month with a really expensive bag when she was monkeying around with bankruptcy.The judge wasn't buying it, saying ...  "I need to send a message. In the eyes of the law it doesn't matter who you are. There are consequences to pay. "Both Teresa and Joe were convicted of wire and bankruptcy fraud. According to the sentencing guidelines, Teresa should have received a sentences of 21 - 27 months.  Prosecutors recommended 21 -- saying if the judge wasn't hard it would show being famous counts.  Nonetheless the judge went way more lenient./n
Laura Michelle Releases Must-Watch Music Video For New Song "Chameleon"/n
Singer Laura Michelle sat down with RADAR to spill all of the details on the must-see music video for her new single, “Chameleon.”
“I co-wrote ‘Chameleon’ with Jim McGorman and Eugene Huang,” she dished. “It’s about a personal situation down to every lyric, i.e ‘We used to eat Twizzlers…’ I wanted the music video, directed by Kurt J. Zendzian, to reflect the story as accurately as possible. Most of the music video was shot in one take! With the help of some special effects from the legendary Joe Gunn it came to life.”
But as effortless as Laura made it look, the production was actually very complex. “This was a difficult, but fun shoot,” she admitted. “It was a total of five days on set. A lot of the video is a continuous shot. If you look closely you’ll see cubby holes where my double and my ‘love interest’ had to run through and be changed for the next scene in seconds, while I stood singing in front of the crumbling brick wall.”
The stunts did not stop there. “The bridge is one of my favorite parts as I’ve ALWAYS wanted a twin and so for there to be 2 of me in this particular scene, we had to be locked in a 24 ft by 24 ft green screen room for 16 hours… People that know me might think it’s the scariest thought that there be two of me,” she laughed.
In the end, all of Laura’s hard work paid off. “I am so happy with how it turned out,” she gushed. “The story comes across, and more importantly the message of the song. ‘You’re in love with someone else, stop fooling yourself’ is not being sung to another person. I’m saying that to myself,” Laura revealed. “In this situation, the guy started out one way and ended up being someone completely different, which is why the song is named, ‘Chameleon.'”

 'Sometimes The Loneliness Makes Me Cry': Farrah Fawcett's Lost Love Letters.../n
Farrah Fawcett sent a series of heartbreaking love letters from her deathbed — and they WERE NOT addressed to long-time love Ryan O’Neal.
RadarOnline.com has exclusively obtained a series of private letters the late Charlie’s Angel star sent to Greg Lott — the man who claims to have been her college sweetheart and with whom she had a secret 11-year affair until her untimely death of cancer on June 25, 2009, at age 62.
The stack of correspondence has been provided to lawyers representing Farrah’s alma mater, the Univerity Of Texas, which is suing 72-year-old O’Neal over a missing Andy Warhol portrait, thought to be worth as much as $30 million.
As Radar was first to reveal, Lott, 67, is set to become a star witness in the art war trial in support of the institution of higher learning.

The trial is set to commence in the Los Angeles Superior Court in November.
But in a deposition on October 24 last year, Lott provided a sensational glimpse into the testimony he’ll deliver from the witness box, including details of the actress’ sex life, their apparent international jaunts together behind-the-back of O’Neal, her often volatile relationship with the Oscar-nominated star — and their secret love letters.
“I think those letters speak for themselves,” Lott declared to lawyers.
In one of the intimate notes from Farrah — which you can read here — the love struck former blonde pin-up asked Lott to be her Valentine.

“Forever, until the end of time,” she gushed.
Lott decided to share the cherished mementos – and never-before-seen photographs, which show Farrah at her most candid — after an attorney for O’Neal issued a statement calling him a convicted felon trying to make a profit off a relationship that he termed, “absurd and completely uncorroborated.”
Lott was not paid for access to the letters.
The letters appear to contradict the attorney’s “uncorroborated” statement and also reveal previously unshared details of Farrah’s brave fight with anal cancer.

In one heartbreaking note, at the height of her battle to beat the cancer that had ravaged her body, Farrah bared her soul to her hidden lover.
“I miss you so much and sometimes the loneliness makes me cry,” she wrote on December 8, 2007, from her hospital bed at a clinic in Bad Wiessee, in the southern German state of Bavaria.
“But this is a daunting journey one must take oneself and there is very little anyone else can do to help.
“I wonder if at the moment of surgery I can do it so I pray for strength and courage and it comes.

“However, not without the most unbearable pain.”
In another letter, Farrah appeared defiant after being told she had not long to live. She even dreamed of a rendezvous with Lott in Acapulco, Mexico, where she made the 1979 film Sunburn.
“Let’s both stay positive and count the days until our Mexican vacation,” she wrote.
The letter, dated March 27, 2007, also sheds new light on her strained relationship with her stepmother Sophie. She married James Fawcett soon after Farrah’s parental mother Pauline died in March 2005.

“Maybe I should fly to Houston for four days; Sophie’s limit for visitation,” Farrah told Lott.
In the same envelope of lust, the devout Catholic sent Lott a rosary, which he still wears around his neck even today.
“If we both say them [the prayers] we might certainly see each other soon,” she told him.
“I love you with all my heart and just know I am getting stronger every day. Love always and forever. Farrah.”

The letters show a romantic and delicate side to the multiple Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominee and are splashed with symbols of her love for Lott: She wrote on personal stationery inscribed with the letterhead ‘Double F’, often drew pink colored love hearts and stuck petals on the paper.
Farrah even wrote a short love note on the back of a brown leaf she had found on a Mexican beach, where she and Lott had secretly holidayed together, as he testified in the deposition.
“I’m sending you a piece of Maroma for your birthday,” she penned.
“I brought this back from our love nest there.”
PHOTOS: Farrah Fawcett Through The Years
On the front of one hand-written postcard was an angel, with a message in German, which Farrah translated for Lott: “Sometimes we have a little wish to send an angel to someone and for me that is you.
“Thinking of you always and love you forever.”
In another intimate epitaph, a besotted Farrah scrawled on a napkin while on board a flight home to Los Angeles and boasted about their sex life after a covert rendezvous.
“Sitting here, missing you already more than I can say and so I decided to write and tell you,” she wrote.

“Only guess what? No paper!
“So I go to the bathroom on Southwest flight #1311 and grab a paper towel.
“Not very classy but I know it won’t matter because that’s the beauty of us. No problems.
“I had the most wonderful time with you. Everything was more than perfect. Thank you for making it so special.

“No stressure (stress and pressure). Great food, great weather, great sex, great, great you!”
Lott has told lawyers that he last spoke to Farrah late on the night of April 9, 2009 – two-and-a-half months before she died.
Then, she was preparing to come home from a bout of treatment for an abdominal hematoma at St John’s Hospital in Santa Monica.
Farrah reportedly told him: “I’m coming home tomorrow. I love you and I will call you.”
PHOTOS: Friends Lay Farrah To Rest
Lott has said he never spoke to her again.
He claimed O’Neal, the actor who rose to fame in Love Story, froze him out of Farrah’s life.
After Farrah never called, as planned, Lott flew to California but was refused entry – supposedly at the behest of O’Neal — at her Wilshire Boulevard condominium in Beverly Hills.
Radar’s revelations create a complex puzzle about whom Farrah was romantically involved with in the last years of her life.

In one corner of this posthumous love triangle is O’Neal, the father to Farrah’s son Redmond, the man who claims she had agreed to marry him on her deathbed. She died before the wedding could take place.
Then there is Lott, the star quarterback at Texas University in the 1960s, Who was left $100,000 in her will. O’Neal was bequeathed nothing.
Lott’s journey back into Farrah’s life took arduous detours through drug use, two prison terms and a battle with alcoholism.
“I lost her to Hollywood,” Lott has admitted in interviews. “But I f—ed it up – twice — and I wasn’t going to f— it up again.”
PHOTOS: Plastic Surgery Disasters
He supposedly reentered Farrah’s life in 1997 after she announced her split from O’Neal after 15-years.
The pair was in a “committed relationship… exclusive,” he said during the deposition.
“For the record … this was a romantic relationship?” a lawyer probed Lott during the deposition, a transcript of which Radar has exclusively obtained.
“Yes,” responded Lott.
PHOTOS: First Photos of Farrah Fawcett’s Gravestone
“A sexual relationship,” questioned the attorney.
“Yes,” responded Lott. “She saw no one else and I saw no one else but her.”
In one letter, she told ‘her darling Greg’: “How sweet that we have been given the chance to grow up, grow wiser and I guess, older together.
“I’m grateful to still be a part of your life and benefit from your eternal optimism in so many ways.” /n

Howard Stern Regrets Being 'A**hole' To Robin Williams: 'I Didn't Know He Was Dying'/n
Howard Stern cannot get over the way he treated Robin Williams almost 30 years ago!
During his show on Wednesday, the shock jock shared with listeners his deep regrets about how he treated the late 63-year-old actor decades ago on terrestrial radio.
Stern, 63, told guest star David Letterman he was still feeling “horrible” for the way he spoke to Williams during a 1986 interview on The Howard Stern Show.

“I have a horrible feeling. Somebody the other night had like a little game we were playing with the dice and they ask you questions, ‘do you have any regrets?’ and I went ‘oh f**k.’ I said this is the only thing I wanted to admit to them,” a sad Stern said.
“I did an interview with Robin Williams a hundred years ago…I was such an asshole…the week before Robin Williams died,” Stern admitted. “I didn’t know he was dying or that he was going to kill himself. I said ‘I want to call him and apologize to him because I was such a f**king moron and I love Robin Williams. And then, of course, that happened. And there’s only a couple of people I really feel this way about.”
PHOTOS: Howard Stern Rips Kelly On Air: ‘You Can’t Walk Off Work!’
Stern previously mentioned the same regret back in 2014 — just one day after Williams committed suicide. 
“I wasn’t rude with Robin Williams, but I asked some questions that perhaps went into areas that he had enough of,” Stern recalled at the time. “I think my whole demeanor and attitude was just shitty. I wasn’t trying to be mean to Robin Williams. I was just trying to be provocative and interesting for the audience, and doing what it is that I thought had to be done. And I was an immature asshole. And so that always haunted me … and then I kind of filed it away and forgot about it.”
“This was a guy who should have been celebrated.”

Donald Trump's First Communications Director Jason Miller Has Love Child with Mistress/nThe man Donald Trump picked to be his communications director who mysteriously resigned before the inauguration has just had 2 babies ... but only one of them with his wife. Jason Miller, the guy who was Trump's official mouthpiece during last year's presidential run, has fathered a baby with Trump loyalist /attorney /talking head A.J. Delgado. Numerous reports surfaced after Miller resigned that he and Delgado had been having an affair for months, and the stories made news when Miller, Delgado and others partied at a Vegas strip club the night before one of the presidential debates. Delgado didn't really keep it much of a secret after Miller's resignation, calling him,  "the 2016 version of John Edwards. " Now get this ... Miller confirmed the birth of the child to Page Six, saying,  "My wife and I, along with our two daughters, are excited to welcome William into the world and into our family, and we appreciate the well wishes we've received from so many " -- i.e., he says his wife is down with it! For her part, in the last 12 hours A.J. has gone on a Twitter tirade railing on Miller, saying,  "I'm not sure what Jason means that he and his wife are excited to welcome Will. Really? News to me. Let me shut up before I say more... " But that was after A.J. went in on Page Six, claiming,  "At least 5 wrong facts in your article. Really bizarre. And you never attempted to contact me by phone today. That's a lie. " Not to mention, before the article even broke she, without naming Miller as the father, tweeted,  "The father did not /has not sent the child even a $1, or a single gift /item. I have had to pay for /cover everything myself. Cheers. " Congratulations? /n

Celebrity Lawyer Mark Kaplan, Divorce Client Claims Sexual Assault, Kaplan Calls BS/nMark Vincent Kaplan -- who has repped the likes of Stephen Collins and Kevin Federline -- allegedly forced his tongue down a client's throat and repeatedly told her he needed to bang her to focus on her divorce case ... so she says in a new lawsuit, but Kaplan says this is a revenge lawsuit after he sued her for skipping out on her bill. Kathy Hakakian ﻿claims Kaplan sexually assaulted her numerous times and she was forced to withstand the attack out of fear he'd quit her divorce case. Kathy says in November 2016 Kaplan insisted meeting at an L.A. bar where he urged her to booze it up to relax. She says he tricked her into showing him her phone, where he found a nude photo of her. She says Kaplan grabbed her, pressed himself against her and put his tongue down her throat. Hakakian claims Kaplan insisted on driving her home, but he pulled over on a darkened street and started groping and kissing her. She says she demanded that he stop, but she says he responded,  "Now I'm motivated to give your case my undivided attention. " She says she stayed on as a client, and at some point they had lunch at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, where she says Kaplan asked,  "How's your p***y doing? " She says Kaplan told her,  "If you let me see another naked picture of you, it will really help me to focus on your case. " She got up and left. But she still stayed on as a client. Hakakian says Kaplan coaxed her into his office for what she thought was prep for a deposition. They were alone in his office and she says he told her he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her, saying,  "When this case is over, I'm going to f**k your p***y so hard from behind you won't know what hit you. " Hakakian, who's repped by attorney Paul Phillips, says when she left she told his receptionist what happened, to which the receptionist replied,  "This isn't the first time I've heard that. " Kaplan's rep tells TMZ, he sued her August 7 to get more than $150k that she owes him for lawyer's fees. He says she didn't pay because she was upset with the result in her divorce which ultimately was handled by a different lawyer. Kaplan says her allegations are wild and untrue and he's confident the judge will see it his way./n

 Maddie In The Middle! Inside Ziegler’s Parents' Bitter Custody Battle Over 'Dance Moms'.../n
Maddie and Mackenzie Ziegler’s parents got into a heated confrontation over their daughters on Dance Moms, but their custody war was even nastier when cameras weren’t rolling. RadarOnline.com has obtained exclusive court documents that go inside their custody battle from hell.
In court papers obtained from Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, Melissa Gisoni filed for divorce from Kurt Ziegler on December 7, 2010 after eight years of marriage.
READ THE BOMBSHELL COURT DOCS!
In their marriage settlement agreement filed on June 15, 2011, Gisoni and Ziegler agreed to share legal custody of Maddie and Mackenzie, with Gisoni having primary physical custody of the minor children and Ziegler getting periods of partial physical custody.
In the consent custody order, Ziegler was ordered to pick up the children every Monday evening from dance class and bring them to school Tuesday morning. He was also expected to pick them up from school Wednesday and drop them off Thursday morning.
He also spent time with Maddie and Mackenzie every other weekend.
But on February 2, 2017, Gisoni filed a petition for modification of custody.

“Mother has, over the course of her children’s life, and most certainly for the past six years, been the primary caregiver for them over the greatest portion of time,” the filing read. “Mother is willing and able, and believes that she is the better parent, in performing all of the necessary parental duties on behalf of the children.”
She continued that she is the “sole financial support” of the children since their separation.
“Father suffers from mental health issues which impairs his ability to properly parent the children,” the filing continues. “Petitioner believes and therefore avers that the children’s best interests will be served by awarding her primary physical and sole legal custody of the children; and partial custody to Father.”
PHOTOS: Dangerous Driver! ‘Dance Moms’ Star Kira Girard Busted For Unsafe Traffic Violations
In Ziegler’s counter-petition for modification of custody, he requests their current custody order be changed to “share physical and shared legal custody.”
“Father believes that he is entitled to modification of this order because it will be in the best interests of the children,” the court papers read. “Mother refuses to abide by the terms of the current order or otherwise cooperate to facilitate Father’s periods of partial custody. Mother is attempting to marginalize Father from the children’s lives.”
He then claims that Gisoni is “not acting in the children’s best interest with regard to their travel schedule and, possibly, careers.”

On June 12, 2017, the court granted Gisoni sole legal and primary custody of Maddie and Mackenzie.
“When the children are in the Murrysville area, father shall have partial custody time with the children,” the filing reads. “Father shall also have partial custody of the children if he travels to Los Angeles.”
Maddie and Mackenzie are not to have overnight visits with their father until they are “willing and ready” to do so.

“Dance had a lot of to with the break up of my family,” he said. “I’m their father, I have a right to know who’s watching my kids.”
When attended their dance recital with Gisoni out of town, Maddie seemed uncomfortable around him.
“I get a little nervous when my dad comes backstage,” she said. “He freaks me out sometimes. It’s not the same as my mom.”
When Abby Lee Miller told him to leave the competition, he fired back, “You know what this dance has done to me and my family, don’t you? I will do everything possible for my daughter to leave your studio next year.”

‘The Voice’ Recap: Adam Levine Finds an Unlikely Ally in Christina Aguilera (VIDEO)/n

                    'The Voice' Week 3 Recap
                







The fight is on between the coaches to fill their teams. 

 MORE >>





 Get your gloves ready, because the battle is ON.
With Monday’s episode of NBC’s The Voice, the blind auditions have come to a close and Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera, Cee Lo Green and Blake Shelton have each filled their teams with 16 incredible singers.
It wasn’t an easy road for the coaches on this last night as they fought tooth and nail to get the contestants they wanted on their respective teams. There were a few standout performances but nothing got us smiling or laughing harder than contestant Cody Belew’s reaction to making it through to the next round.
As the last singer of the night we knew Belew was headed for Team Cee Lo, but to make things a bit more dramatic the coach didn’t push his button until their were seconds left in his performance. As Belew was turned around at the end of his performance, he didn’t realize that his idol had actually picked him for his team. Upon seeing Cee Lo pushed the button, he through out a “You hit it! OH MY GOD!” and TON of expletives while giving Green a humungous hug. Also, how funny was his confession that he moves his hips like “bam, bam”? It was the perfect way to end this part of the competition.
What other highlights rounded out this episode?

Christina took ADAM’s side for once. When Caitlin Michelle performed “Cosmic Love” by Florence and the Machine, we were floored to hear someone so different — as were Blake and Adam. The dukes were up for the two friends in their fight for the Boston native. With both coaches laying it out there and Blake differentiating that he’s a normal coach, Christina told her, “If you want to be a risk taker… head over to Adam’s team.” We also chuckled a bit when Christina told the country man – “You didn’t even know who Florence and the Machine was – that’s all I’m going to say” – after Caitlin made her choice.

“You had me at thang.” Mr. Shelton was all about using his connections and country swag to win his contenders over. Nicole Johnson, 18, made Kelly Clarkson’s “Mr. Know-it-All” her own when she put a country twist to it. Catching the eye of Blake and Cee Lo, the two coaches did their best to sway her to their side. We have to say, Blake pulling out the “You had me at thang” line was pretty smooth. And being a country girl, Johnson had to go with the country pro.
How cute are the families of these singers? We couldn’t help but say, “Aw,” watching Natalie Hernandez’s parents when three of the coaches turned around for their daughter and she chose Team Christina. They were simply adorable. We want to hug them. Rudy Parris’ daughter and grandson also get an honorable mention in the cuteness competition when he chose Team Blake. The families really are such a huge part of this show and a reason why we love the blind auditions so much.

“I love you but…” Kayla Nevarez had a big decision to make between Adam, Cee Lo and Christina after her performance of Estelle’s “American Boy.” Christina was dying to have the 17-year-old singer on her team telling her, “Let me put it to you plain and simple… I’m your coach.” With Christina pouring it on thick, Cee Lo didn’t even feel like he had a chance. Meanwhile, Adam reminded the California girl that the has won The Voice before and that he knew “without a doubt in my mind, I know that you’re the one for that.” Looking at Christina, Nevarez told her, “I love you so but..” and then chose Team Adam. She also showed some awesome sass and drive telling him, “We better win this.”
Also picked up tonight were Lady Gaga backup singer Chevonne (Team Cee Lo) and 16-year-old Celica Westbrook (Team Christina).

Fifth Harmony Flaunts Individual Styles On The MTV VMAs Red Carpet!/n

We feel so conflicted.
On Sunday, Fifth Harmony stopped by the MTV VMAs red carpet, where they certainly made a splash. While Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane, and Lauren Jauregui all looked incredible in their respective red carpet looks, it seems as though they forgot that they're in a girl group because none of their outfits were coordinated.
Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but we would've liked to see them in ensembles that tied together. We can't be the only ones who think this, right??
Nonetheless, the ladies of 5H looked like total A-listers at the Hollywood event. We mean, Dinah flaunted her curves in a white Roberto Cavalli gown, Ally was playful AF in her Reem Acra mini dress/capri look, Normani was curvalicious in a black La Bourjoisie dress, and Lauren dressed to impress in a form-fitting red Cushnie et Ochs number.
At the end of the day, we're Down for their decisions.

First Amy Schumer responded, now it's John Oliver's return to chime in regarding his Gilmore Girls shout out.Netflix released the first Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life teaser at the 2016 TCA Summer Press Tour. It featured footage shot just for the trailer of Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel as Lorelai and Rory Gilmore talking about pop culture happenings. In the teaser, Graham's Lorelai wandered if Schumer would like her and later asked if Oliver, the host of HBO's Last Week Tonight, would think she was hot."Lorelai, the answer is yes I do find you hot and I'll tell you why. I'm a red-blooded male with an inbuilt heat detector," Oliver said on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, gesturing to his groin. "And my heat detector registers you as en fuego."

Public Enemies Is A Snooze/n
It’s not a good sign when the guy in the row in front of you is dead asleep throughout the entire movie. But the boredom that is Public Enemies is not star Johnny Depp’s fault. He’s as charismatic and as handsome as ever playing 30s era gangster/bank robber John Dillinger.
One problem is the uninspiring supporting cast, which includes the increasingly grating Christian Bale as FBI agent Melvin Purvis and Billy Crudup, who is totally miscast as J. Edgar Hoover and adopts a weird James-Cagney like cadence while everyone else talks normally. All the other characters, lots of guys in fedoras, look so much alike, you have no idea who’s who.
And you kind of don’t care. The script, directed by Michael Mann, fudges history and has little depth. Besides a written statement at the beginning, which explains that John Dillinger started robbing banks during the Great Depression, we really have no idea what motivated him to turn to a life of crime or how he became so powerful and violent. 
The plot is thin and lacks suspense. Yeah, so he wants to make a big score and doesn’t want to get busted by the Feds. The guy was a folk hero, considered by many at the time to be a modern-day Robin Hood. That’s barely touched on and would have been a lot more interesting as the main focus. 
Instead, we get stuff like a lame shootout in the woods and a car chase in which the old autos look like they’re going about 30 miles an hour. After a summer of Transformers and Terminator, watching the action in Public Enemies is like going on the kiddie rollercoaster after the Cyclone.
There are a couple of great things besides Johnny Depp and his snazzy three-piece suits. Dillinger’s prison breakouts were genius and there’s something really cool about the rat-a-tat-tat of the old-school machine guns. Plus, Marion Cotillard, who plays Dillinger’s dishy dame Billie Frechette, is enchanting.
But if you want to learn more about Dillinger, and the great bank robbers of the 1930s, just Google him or go to Wikipedia. Or better yet, read the excellent book this movie is based on called Public Enemies: America’s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI.

Rick Fox & Eliza Dushku -- Court Road Trip/nRick Fox and his girlfriend Eliza Dushku didn't just go the extra mile for a family member Thursday -- they went an extra 115 miles -- driving from L.A. to a courtroom in the Mojave Desert to support Eliza's big bro. Turns out, Eliza's big brother -- actor Nathaniel Dushku -- was busted in the desert city of Barstow, CA back in January, after cops say dude was speeding down the highway at more than 100 MPH. Nate was due back in court yesterday -- and Rick and Eliza made the drive to lend support.But this story has a happy ending -- we're told the officer who busted Nate was a no-show in court and the ticket was dismissed./n
Mariah Carey's Hollywood Star Vandalized, Cops Investigating/nMariah Carey's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized over the weekend ... in a much more subtle way than Donald Trump's. A rep for the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce tells us ... they called the LAPD Sunday and they gave cops a lead -- someone on Instagram claimed responsibility. We're told it cost $1,500 to restore the star. Hollywood Historic Trust has already had it cleaned up. Cops are on the hunt. They're pulling surveillance video. The investigation is for felony vandalism. No word if James Otis has an alibi./n
Why Lucy Hale Quit Drinking and What Finally Made Her Say ''I Don't Give a F--k'' After years of living in the Hollywood party world, she simply has "no interest" in that lifestyle anymore. "I tried re.../n
Lucy Hale may have closed one of the biggest chapters of her life when Pretty Little Liars ended, but it's also opened a new chapter: becoming herself.The brunette beauty opened up in an interview with Byrdie and admitted she's only recently figured out who she is—and part of that was changing everything she's known for the past near-decade."I'm almost 28, but…I think I only just figured out who I was a year ago," she told the publication, recalling the reason she first chopped her hair into a short bob. "I know it seems silly because it's just hair, but at a point, I was like, 'Why don't I just own that I'm different?' I guess cutting my hair off was like me finally saying, 'I don't give a f--k.'"

But the transformation extended beyond her drastic, new locks.Hale has taken her life in her own hands, molding her "new" (ish) persona from the inside out. One of the ways she did so was in her decision to quit drinking."I'm just always trying to surround myself with better people and be the best version of myself possible," she explained. "I know it sounds obnoxious to hear people say that, but why not?"

After years of living in the Hollywood party world, she simply has "no interest" in that lifestyle anymore. "I tried really hard to be the social butterfly. Becoming a part of this popular show…everyone just says yes to you, so you get away with a lot, and then you make mistakes."Though she admits it's "hard" in Los Angeles, going as far as calling it a "separate country," she's found herself immersed in some of its more positive cultural attributes, like SoulCycle.In fact, after watching herself gain what she called the "freshman 15" on PLL, Hale found her "church" at the popular cycling joint."I go home, and my dad's like, 'You L.A. hippie with your crystals and your SoulCycle!'" she laughed. "I always used to make fun of those people, but now I think it's just magic." 

Needless to say, Hale is taking a deep dive into her well-being following the end of PLL, but she knows the break won't last too long."Maybe I'll go on vacation...But I do love working," she admitted. "What I do is so gratifying 99% of the time. Being busy—I get a thrill out of it."So what can we expect out of her next? "I'm itching to do something insane and crazy," she revealed...and now we can't wait to see what it is!

Wintour told the press what she said to the Queen in their brief exchange.
“I congratulated her on Prince Philip’s service because obviously that’s so remarkable and such an inspiration to us all,” said Wintour [via BBC].
Also in attendance was Wintour’s daughter, Bee Shaffer, who shared a congratulatory post for her mom on her Instagram account.

 Jennifer Garner & Ben Affleck Plan Emergency Trip To West Virginia After Family Tragedy.../n
Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are setting aside their differences to help her parents and others face the devastating after effects of the flooding in West Virginia.
“Jen wants her parents in Los Angeles, but they refuse to leave their home, which has been destroyed,” an insider told Radar of Patricia and Bill, who still live in Charleston, where Garner grew up. “Jen’s parents are in a hotel because at home they have no electricity.”
Now Garner is enlisting Affleck’s help to do whatever they can to alleviate their suffering and help other West Virginians in the process.

“Jen was planning a relaxing vacation to West Virginia, but it looks like she’ll forego that to plan a fundraiser there instead,” said the insider.
Besides Affleck, 43, the 44-year-old actress is teaming up with her childhood friend, Senator Corey Palumbo, to raise money to aid the stricken region.
Garner has talked about her love for her hometown in the past.

Carol Burnett Explains How Lucille Ball Got a NSFW Nickname/n
Carol Burnett, 82, says it was her good friend Lucille Ball who gave her some very valuable career advice.  
Over dinner one night, Ball explained to Burnett that during her years on I Love Lucy with husband and co-star Desi Arnaz, it was Arnaz who dealt with the writing, lighting, and many other day-to-day operations on the show.  
But after Arnaz and Ball divorced in 1960, that all changed.  
“Lucy told me when she got a divorce she had to do all the stuff that Desi did and the first table read on the Lucy Show stunk.”  
After the disastrous table read, Ball went into her office and realized at that moment she had to be bold and take charge.  
“She said to me, ‘Kid, that is when they put the ‘S’ on the end of my last name,'” Burnett tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue on stands Friday.   
Burnett, who will be honored with the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award on Jan. 30, says when she did the Carol Burnett Show in 1967, it was difficult for a woman to take the reins.  
“If I spoke up or did what Jackie Gleason did… Men could get away with it. But in my era, I would have been labeled a bitch.”  
Burnett quickly learned how to tip-toe around a work problem.   
“Instead of saying, ‘guys this stinks we’ve got to fix it,’ I would say, ‘I am not doing this right, can you help me out here?’ ”

Cruise's Lawyer Will Probably Never Be Prosecuted for Wiretapping/nFrom Harvey Levin's H-Wood blog Sources connected with a Federal wiretapping investigation tell me that a key Hollywood power player is almost certainly in the clear. Attorney Bert Fields, who has represented a stable of clients that include Michael Jackson, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, has been a prime target in the probe.  Investigators believe that Anthony Pellicano -- known as the P.I. to the stars -- illegally wiretapped people who were in disputes with celebrity clients.Fields frequently used the services of Pellicano, who is currently in a Federal holding facility pending prosecution.  The Feds are examining whether Fields put Pellicano up to wiretapping adversaries of his clients.   But here's the rub.  My sources say the Feds are at a loss -- that so far, they don't have a single audiotape in which Fields can be heard talking to Pellicano and sanctioning an illegal wiretap.  And investigators are losing hope they will ever have the goods. In contrast to Fields, the Feds have audiotapes in which another lawyer, Terry Christensen, is heard talking to Pellicano about wiretaps.  Christensen has already been indicted. And there's yet another problem.  Pellicano had a practice of illegally audio taping people he talked with on the phone.  The Feds have hours of tape, but they are encoded and investigators are not having any luck breaking the code./n

Nerlens Noel Shades 76ers: I Don't Miss Philly! /nHe's unemployed at the moment, but think Nerlens Noel misses playing for the Philadelphia 76ers??  "NAH.

KWAKU ALSTON

Whoa, baby!Kelly Rowland graces the April cover of Essence magazine with not only her hubby, Tim Weatherspoon, but her adorable newborn son, Titan Jewell Weatherspoon!Up until this point, the Destiny's Child singer has only been giving fans a glimpse of her little one through several shots on Instagram of his feet and the back of his head. But now the world gets to see little baby Titan up close and personal—and what an adorable babe he is!In addition to little Titan's big magazine cover debut, Rowland gushed to Essence, "My road to my happiness hasn't been an easy one. It hasn't been peachy all the time, but I am so, so happy," she said. As for putting family first, she added with a laugh, "My priority is my husband first. That's how the baby got there."

Shortly after his Nov. 4 birth, Rowland's lifelong BFF Beyoncé shared the very first photo of Titan when she Instagrammed a sweet hand-holding photo and her congratulations."There's no better feeling than holding my beautiful nephew," she gushed. "I thank god for the honor of witnessing my sisters journey into motherhood. I've always dreamt of our little ones growing up together. I'm so thankful for our bond. Baby Ty, I love you so much. Congrats to my Spoons."Michelle Williams, Kelly's other Destiny's Child bandmate, was also overjoyed by baby Titan's arrival late last year."Kelly's going to be an amazing mom," she gushed to E! News. "She's always been great with children. She loves babysitting, she loves buying stuff for kids. She has such a big heart. She's a giver and a nurturing person and, really, that's what motherhood is all about."What a beautiful family!

Fox News Host Eric Bolling Accused Of Sending Lewd Photo To Female Co-Workers/n
In a new scandal for the embattled Fox News channel, The Specialists host Eric Bolling has been accused of sending an unsolicited photo of male genitalia to at least three female co-workers years ago via text message, according to a report by the Huffington Post.
But Bolling’s attorney Michael Bowe staunchly denied the allegations in a statement to Breitbart News, saying, “The story is based on anonymous sources and not true. No such unsolicited communications occurred.”

The Huffington Post web site said it had 14 sources, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, who claimed that Bolling’s two female colleagues at Fox Business and one at Fox News received the naughty message from Bolling.
According to the Huffington Post, the women who received the photos decided they were from Bolling, who previously starred on Fox News’ The Five, because they recognized his phone number from other correspondence.
One of the women allegedly texted Bolling, 54, and told him to stop sending her such photos, the Huffington Post article said.
According to the story, “The women did not solicit the messages, which they told colleagues were deeply upsetting and offensive. One of the recipients said that when she replied to Bolling via text, telling him never to send her such photos again, he did not respond. Four people, outside of the recipients, confirmed to HuffPost they’d seen the photo, and eight others said the recipients had spoken to them about it.”
A Fox News spokesperson told USA Today, about “We were just informed of this late Friday afternoon via a Huffington Post inquiry and plan to investigate the matter.”

But Bolling’s attorney told HuffPo, “Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.”
As Radar has reported, this is the latest in a series of allegation against a Fox News employee.
Fox News found Roger Ailes came under fire when former anchor Gretchen Carlson sued him, saying he’d sexually harassed her. That suit was settled out of court — but prompted a flurry of new allegations against Ailes. He resigned in disgrace in July 2016 and died on May 18, 2017, at age 77.
Also, Bill O’Reilly, 67, host of the then highest-rated cable news show, The O’Reilly Factor host, was hit with a sexual harassment scandal.
O’Reilly was ousted from the network in April after it was revealed FOX had paid nearly $13 million to women who had accused him of sexual harassment over the years.

Fox News conservative firebrand Sean Hannity fought back against blogger Debbie Schlussel‘s allegations that the host, 55, had invited her to his hotel room after he made an appearance in Detroit. She claimed when she declined the offer, Hannity blacklisted her from his show. But Schlussel later backed away from her claims after Hannity staunchly denied it and fought back, threatening legal action.
Earlier this year, Fox’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, reportedly reached a $2.5 million settlement with former Fox News contributor Tamara Holder, who says she was sexually assaulted by Francisco Cortes, the vice president of Fox News Latino. He was later fired from the network.
And as Radar readers know, Fox News has denied claims that they banned host Diana Falzone from the network due to her infertility reveal after she filed a gender discrimination lawsuit.

Also, former Fox News personality Andrea Tantaros is suing Irena Briganti, the Executive Vice President of Corporate Communications at the network, for allegedly orchestrating a plot to force former colleague Nomiki Konst to send a negative tweet about Tantaros, in order to draw attention away from her upcoming sexual harassment lawsuit.
In a statement issued to Radar on behalf of Irena Briganti by Dechert LLP, Briganti said regarding Tantaros’ allegations, “I had nothing whatsoever to do with Ms. Konst’s decision to publish a tweet about her views on Bill O’Reilly, in which she mentioned Andrea Tantaros. I have never even met or spoken with Ms. Konst.”
A Fox News spokesperson told Radar on August 6, “Eric Bolling has been suspended pending the results of an investigation, which is currently underway.”
And Fox Business host Charles Payne was recently suspended from the network amid sexual harassment claims.

Adam Levine Reignites His Feud With The MTV VMAs — & Wife Behati Prinsloo Joins In On The Hate Too!/n

It's no secret that Adam Levine isn't a fan of the MTV VMAs.
But, just in case we all forgot about how the Maroon 5 frontman feels, he made sure to remind us of his disdain by taking to Twitter and putting the award show on blast.

On Sunday evening, the Sugar singer wrote: 

It's always exciting to see how utterly horrible the VMAs will be. They really delivered so far this year. #HOLYFUCK

Oh snap! The Voice judge's feud with the VMAs dates back to 2011 when the hitmaker told the award show to "fuck" itself.
Adam's wife, Behati Prinsloo, also got shady about the industry event as she added:

Hey, Behati's just saying what we were all thinking!!
As for Adam's remarks, we wouldn't say the VMAs were "utterly horrible." We mean, did you catch Kendrick Lamar's opening number???

Ms. O coproduced. Not only is Washington the star of the movie, he also directed it. Inspired by a true story, The Great Debaters tells the story of Melvin Tolson (Washington), a college professor at a small African-American college in the d.../n
Oprah Winfrey tearfully begged students at her all-girls school in South Africa for forgiveness on Sunday following allegations of abuse by staffers there. But now it looks like the talk-show queen may be facing the media to answer questions about the ordeal.  I'm told that Winfrey is set to embark on a full-throttle publicity blitz for The Great Debaters, Denzel Washington’s new movie, which Ms. O coproduced. Not only is Washington the star of the movie, he also directed it. 

First up, I hear that Winfrey and Washington will likely be appearing on not one, but at least two magazine covers together. A source tells me the two are supposed to be shot for the covers of Ebony and newspaper magazine supplement Parade. Washington’s rep confirmed that the joint covers are in the works. “The magazine requests are in, and we’re trying to figure out how to accommodate them,” the rep said.

Inspired by a true story, The Great Debaters tells the story of Melvin Tolson (Washington), a college professor at a small African-American college in the deep South who coaches the school’s first debate team into a national championship face-off with Harvard. Costars include fellow Oscar winner Forest Whitaker.Buzz is strong on the movie, which hits theaters Dec. 25. I’m told it received a standing ovation last week when it was screened for theater owners during the ShowEast convention in Orlando, Florida.

Proving to be the greatest athlete of our time, Serena Williams nabbed her seventh Wimbledon title and 22nd Grand Slam win overall over the weekend, and she swept the Ladies’ Doubles finals with her sister Venus Williams.

Beating Angelique Kerber 75, 6-3 in the final match on Sunday, Serena is now tied with Steffi Graf for the most major championship wins in the Open era (which began in 1968), and stands just behind Margaret Court’s all-time marker of 24. Serena, who is ranked No. 1, won Wimbledon last year as well.

Serena told reporters, “One thing I learned about last year is to enjoy the moment. I’m definitely going to enjoy this.”
Hours after her big win, the Williams sisters were back on Centre Court where they dominated 6-3, 6-4 over Timea Babos and Yaroslava Shvedova, making their Grand Slam records final 14-0.
“I had just enough time to change and get the ankles re-taped,” Serena commented after the match. “It was fine. I didn’t want to warm down.”
She added, “It was really special to be out there again, to win Wimbledon in doubles. We love it, we love playing doubles, we love being together.”

On the men’s side, Andy Murray came out victorious, beating Milos Raonic 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2). It’s his second Wimbledon win in the past four years, after he became the first British man to win Wimbledon (which is hosted in London) in 77 years back in 2013.
Murray noted, “I’m just really proud that I managed to do it again after a lot of tough losses in the latter stages of the Slams over the last couple of years. I’m also aware of how difficult these competitions are to win once. To do it twice here, an event where there’s a lot of pressure on me to perform well, I’m very proud with how I’ve handled that.”
“I feel more content this time,” he said. “I feel like this was sort of more for myself than anything, and my team as well…. Last time it was just pure relief, and I didn’t really enjoy the moment as much, whereas I’m going to make sure I enjoy this one more than the others.”

His opponent Raonic, meanwhile, became the first Canadian man to reach a Grand Slam final as well as the first non-European to get this far at Wimbledon since Andy Roddick in 2009.
Benedict Cumberbatch was super ecstatic for Murray, telling him after his win with a bow, “It was brilliant, it was really inspiring to watch.” Murray replied, “I’m a huge, huge fan,” and Cumberbatch told him he was a huge fan as well.
Both Prince William and Kate Middleton were the first to congratulate Murray post-match, followed by London’s Mayor, Sadiq Khan.
Both Williams and Murray attended the Wimbledon Champions dinner early in the evening, looking glam for the happy affair.
Later that night, Murray celebrated at Drama nightclub with his wife Kim. Some of the One Direction boys were there as well.

Watch and Weep: New Trailer for Winnie the Pooh's Origin Story Goodbye Christopher Robin Will Make You Cry
/n

Have you ever wondered where Winnie the Pooh came from? What inspired the beloved character?
The first full-length trailer for Goodbye Christopher Robin offers an answer, along with a healthy dose of childhood nostalgia, critically acclaimed actors and the right amount of movie magic involving a beloved teddy bear and his familiar friends. It packs a strong emotional punch. But don’t take our word for it, watch the clip above and judge for yourself.
The family-friendly drama revolves around author A. A. Milne (Domhnall Gleeson) and his son Christopher Robin (newcomer Will Tilston), whose stuffed animals inspired the magical world of Winnie the Pooh during a difficult time following the first World War. Before they know it, Pooh and his friends become an international sensation and later, some of the most valuable fictional characters of all time.
Fox Searchlight
We see in the trailer the fuzzy inspirations for Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and Tigger, but also hints of family struggle and a young boy thrust into the spotlight too soon following the sudden sweeping success of the books. It eventually takes a toll on the family: father, son, Christopher Robin’s mother Daphne (Margot Robbie) and his nanny Olive (Kelly Macdonald).
Fox Searchlight
Goodbye Christopher Robin is directed by Simon Curtis (Woman in Gold, My Week with Marilyn) and opens in theaters on Oct. 13.

Rebecca Gayheart's Troubled Sister Dies After Jail Drama/n
Rebecca Gayheart’s troubled sister Rachel has died, Radar has learned.
Lonnie Brewer, jail administrator for the Perry County jail, confirmed to Radar that Rachel Gayheart died at the Hazard ARH Medical Center Hospital in Kentucky following some time in jail.

“She came to the jail first, then died in the hospital yesterday after being in the hospital three or four days,” Brewer said to Radar on Saturday. “I don’t know what the cause of death is.”
Brewer added, “There’s a lot to the story but I can’t tell you more. It was an unfortunate incident. “I can’t tell you why she was in jail. I am not talking about the family or giving out arrest details,” he said. The Perry County Coroner has so far not returned Radar’s call. As Star Magazine reported in 2014, Rachel had issues with drugs in the past. Star discovered Rachel had been arrested three times.
Dane is probably best known for playing “Dr. McSteamy” on “Grey’s Anatomy.” At the height of his “McSteamy” fame in 2009, a leaked video showed a woozy Dane in a hot tub session with Gayheart and ex-Miss Teen USA contestant Kari Ann Peniche.
“Rachel has had problems with drugs,” their father, Curtis Gayheart, previously confirmed to Star.
A source added three years ago to Star, “Rachel dug herself into a financial ditch and had to turn to her big sister for help. But Rebecca loves her and was happy she could bail her out.” Curtis said that the former Noxzema girl did help her sister back then.
Rebecca, 45, and her husband Eric Dane have weathered scandals in the past.

In 2001, Rebecca was driving a vehicle which struck nine-year-old Jorge Cruz, Jr., as he walked across a street in Los Angeles. He died the following day from his injuries. On November 27, 2001, Rebecca pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter. She was sentenced to three years of probation, a one-year suspension of her license, a $2,800 fine, and 750 hours of community service.

In 2009, a nude video was posted online that showed Rebecca, Dane, and their pal, Kari Ann Peniche. Although the threesome didn’t have sex, it raised eyebrows. Rebecca and Dane have two kids and they put the video scandal behind them.
But as Radar recently reported, Rebecca was spotted partying with another man as Dane battled depression.

Is it just us, or are things getting a little shady in here?

Kelly Ripa once again made things awkward for Live with Kelly and Michael co-host Michael Strahan, who will be leaving his post for a spot on Good Morning America, when she unexpectedly brought up the retired footballer’s two failed marriages while on the air. During a chat on Friday’s episode (Apr. 29, 2016), Ripa blindsided Strahan when she launched into a conversation about divorce.
“There’s a great article in the paper and I want to get your take on it because I don’t have a take on it. But I want yours. So you’ve gotten divorced,” she began, as her co-host looked at the camera flabbergasted. Ripa, refusing to make eye contact with Strahan, then brought up the trend of “birdnesting,” where children live in one home and their divorced parents take turns rotating in and out every couple of days.

“If I’m sharing my house with my ex every once in a while and she can get in with a key, at any point, I’m definitely locking the door,” Strahan weighed in after getting his composure back. He joked, “I’m not going to do it. Maybe I should. Her house is nicer than mine!”
Strahan divorced Wanda Hutchins, with whom he shares an adult son and daughter, in 1996. He legally parted ways with Jean Muggli in 2006 and share custody of their 11-year-old twin daughters.
However, this wasn’t the first time Ripa, who has been married to husband Mark Consuelos for 20 years, cracked an uncomfortable joke to call out Strahan on-air. Earlier this week, she openly joked about taking a hissing armadillo into “contract negotiations.”

Sorry, Justin Trudeau.

Adorable as they may be, Kate Middleton’s kids aren’t always so well-behaved. Case in point: Princess Charlotte’s tiny temper tantrum on the last day of the royal family’s tour of Germany.

After checking out the helicopters at a local airport with dad Prince William and older brother Prince George on Friday, the 2-year-old had a mini meltdown on the tarmac when she was told it was time to go home. Like what many a children would do in a similar situation, Charlotte planted herself firmly on the ground and refused to walk.

Kate, who was clad in a lavender dress by Emilia Wickstead and nude Gianvito Rossi pumps, tried to comfort the child by crouching down and speaking with her daughter. After wiping a away a few tears from the tot, the Duchess of Cambridge picked up Charlotte in her arms before climbing aboard their private jet.
On the other hand, Prince George looked happy to return home to England as he skipped up the stairs to their plane. Wearing a checkered shirt from Neck and Neck and navy shorts, the 3-year-old seemed excited to get a start on his birthday celebrations this weekend.

“George has got a big tummy,” William gushed about his son during the trip, according to Daily Mail. “He’ll probably end up eating all his cake by himself!”

Kardashian Incest Scandal Explodes: Kim's Father Robert Was Engaged To Cousin!/n
Robert Kardashian‘s friendship with O.J. Simpson wasn’t his only controversial relationship — RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that Kim’s father was engaged to his third cousin, Denice Halicki!
Shortly after he filed for divorce from Kris Jenner, he began cozying up to H. B. Halicki‘s widow and even showed her off to his friends! His friend and pastor Kenn Gulliksen recalled meeting Denice, and realizing that “they were kissin’ cousins.”
“Robert was now seriously involved romantically with his third cousin, Denice,” Jerry Oppenheimer described of Kenn, Robert and Denice’s first encounter in his book, The Kardashians: An American Drama.
PHOTOS: TV Show Of The Century? It’s Selma Blair As Kris Jenner, David Schwimmer As Robert Kardashian & More On Set For ‘American Crime Story: The People V. OJ Simpson’
“Denice was very nice and very sweet,” Robert’s friend and pastor Kenn Gulliksen told the author. “After all, he’d been through a lot and he had a need to kind of return to his roots, and Denice was both beautiful and Armenian.”
He also claimed that Robert knew of their family ties, saying: “long before Gulliksen was introduced to Denice at that desert lunch, Kardashian had told him about how the Kardashians and the family of the famous Demos were related” — Demos Shakarian was Denice’s grandfather.
Regardless, the couple pursued a years-long relationship that ended in 1996, and the couple even sent out a Christmas card as family saying: “‘The Kardashian Family wishes you a Merry Christmas’…it was signed in gold letters, ‘Robert and Denice,’ with the names of the Kardashian children inscribed below.”

Robert helped her Denice in her deceased husband’s probate cases, and they soon became in the courtroom in other ways as well.
Denice was also involved in O.J.’s murder trial alongside her fiancee, as she “was the one who cooked the meals, who accompanied O.J. and Kardashian to Nicole’s funeral, who was an eyewitness to the various way they disguised themselves to avoid the media. And on the day the arrest warrant was issued, charging O.J. with a double homicide, it was Denice who advised her fiancee to quickly summon Al Cowlings to act as O.J.’s protector in case he tried to injure or kill himself, a decision she’d come to regret.”
Robert reportedly “begged” Denice to marry him, but she refused. Regardless, Kris wrote in her memoir that she “was really, really cool, but especially amazing to my kids.”
PHOTOS:When Will O.J. Be Released From Prison? All Simpson’s Prison Details Revealed
Their breakup after the trial was just as brutal, as Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne claimed in a piece on the couple that: “the story went at the time that she took all the furniture and the television sets with her.”
“When she told Kardashian she was leaving, a Kardashian friend recalled him saying, ‘I told her to take her s**t and get the f**k out,” the book’s author added.
Are you shocked that Robert dated his third cousin? Sound off in the comments!

R&B Singer Kehlani Reveals Suicide Attempt Amid Speculation She Cheated on NBA Star Kyrie Irving: 'I Wanted to Leave This Earth'/n

Kehlani was hospitalized after attempting to commit suicide, the R&B singer revealed in a now-deleted Instagram post.  
“Today I wanted to leave this earth,” Kehlani, 20 – whose last name is Parrish, though she goes by her first name professionally – captioned a photo of an IV in her arm as she rested in a hospital bed. “[I’m] being completely selfish for once.”  
The post followed up speculation Kehlani cheated on her boyfriend, Cleveland Cavaliers basketball player Kyrie Irving, 24.  
“Never thought I’d get to such a low point,” Kehlani penned. “But.. Don’t believe the blogs you read .. No one was cheated on and I’m not a bad person… Everyone is hurt and everyone is in a place of misunderstanding.”   
She added: “But as of today, I had no single wish to see tomorrow.. But God saved me for a reason, and for that… I must be grateful.. Cuz I’m not in heaven right now for a reason.”

Then the Grammy-nominated musician – who was once a member of singing group PopLyfe, a finalist on season 6 of America’s Got Talent – suggested she was taking a break from social media: she wrote, “On that note.. Bye Instagram.” (All posts have since been removed from her verified account, which has two million followers.)   

Irving has not yet publicly responded to the news.   
In the last post showing Irving and Kehlani on his Instagram account on March 11, the NBA star wrote, “Good ole fashioned partners @kehlani.”   
Kehlani’s rep isn’t commenting at this time. Reps for the Cleveland Cavaliers did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

Porn Star Who Claims She Had Sex With Sheen Hires Criminal Defense Attorney/n
Charlie Sheen has said that he is done paying shakedown money to those who tried to blackmail him over his HIV positive status, but RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that a porn star who claims she had sex with him and supplied him with women has hired a criminal defense attorney.
The Los Angeles based XXX film star went into a panic after The National ENQUIRER broke details of the cover-up scandal on Monday, November 16, 2015, a source told Radar.
After being contacted by Radar for details about her relationship with Sheen as well as details about the women she arranged to have sex with him, she contacted Todd Spodek, the New York attorney who represented Genevieve Sabourin, Alec Baldwin‘s stalker who served six months in Rikers Island Prison.

“She’s freaked out by this whole thing,” Spodek told Radar. He insisted that she does not want her name to be publicized in connection with Sheen.
Legal eagle Gloria Allred announced that she also has been contacted by women “with reference to Charlie Sheen and their rights.”
Radar spoke to a legal source with knowledge of the situation who said one top L.A. lawyer had secretly settled at least 12 — and possibly up to 24 — cases brought against Sheen by people he exposed to the virus.

Secret Baby! Tom Hanks’ Troubled Son Welcomes Daughter After One-Night Stand/n
Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson’s son is turning his troubled life around by welcoming a secret child. Chet Hanks, 26, reportedly became a father to a baby girl eight months ago.
“Tom and Rita are really excited to have a new granddaughter,” a source told In Touch. “They’ve fallen in love with the little girl.”
Chet conceived his first child during an alleged one-night stand with a woman named Tiffany. Despite the insider claiming the romp was drug-fueled, Chet has remained sober since the arrival of his baby girl.
“Tom’s had a lot of issues with Chet over the years, given Chet’s drug and alcohol issues, but this baby has changed all of that,” the source claimed. “Chet’s now sober and is currently working as a drug counselor. He lives in Santa Monica and pays $2,800 a month in rent, with the help of his dad.”
PHOTOS: Delivery Room Drama! Inside Blac Chyna’s On-Camera Delivery
Although the baby is mainly cared for by his baby mama and her family, Chet is telling everyone how she has “truly changed his life.”
“Chet is financially supporting the baby, of course, with Tom’s help,” the source said. “They adore that baby and even spent Halloween with her. She will always be loved and taken care of by the Hanks family.”
As RadarOnline.com exclusively reported, the Sully actor blames himself for his son’s battle with drugs.
“Tom has been beating himself up over Chet losing his bearings,” the insider said. “He’s putting the fault squarely on his shoulders for not being attentive enough during his formative years. Instead, he chose to put his career first and foremost before his family.”

Despite multiple rehab stints, Chet hit rock bottom during a trip to London in May when he reportedly got drunk at a nightclub. He later trashed his hotel room and caused $2,000 in damages.

Pauline Potter Is World's 'Heaviest Living Woman'/n
It’s the small things – like driving a car, dancing, getting dressed in the morning and checking the mail – that Pauline Potter thinks about on afternoons when she stays in bed and listens to the world just beyond the walls of her bedroom in Sacramento, Calif.  
“Everything people take for granted – those are the things I dream of,” she tells PEOPLE. “I’m not living. I want more.”  
But getting more out of life will require Potter, who holds the Guinness World Record for heaviest living woman, to weigh less.   
Potter weighed 643 lbs. as of February 2011, which qualified her to be included in Guinness World Records list for 2012, although she thinks she weighs closer to 700 lbs. today. (According to Guinness World Records, the heaviest woman ever is Rosalie Bradford, who registered a peak weight of 1,200 lbs. in January 1987.)   
She realized the title is “a little degrading,” but Potter, 48, is sharing her story because she’s desperate. When the 2012 edition of the records book is released this month on Sept. 15, she’s hoping somebody will read about her and offer to help her become healthy.  
Maybe a doctor or a nutritionist will reach out, she says of her hope, and she’s even open to talking to other people who need help, too.  
“I don’t like people to think bad of me, but I’m willing to risk that to get the help,” she says of her weight-loss aspirations. “I have a lot of love to give, and I want to be able to help others, but I need a little help right now.”  
‘Compulsive Eater’
Pauline Potter as a childShe can talk about the people who lean out of their cars, cell phones in hand, to take pictures of her when she passes by. She remembers a particularly hurtful day when she was shopping at Walmart and a mother whisked her young daughter away in the opposite direction like she was “contagious or maybe retarded,” Potter says.  
“I still hurt. I still bleed,” she says. But the cruelty is matched by kindness, and she can also talk about the people who hold doors open for her when she enters stores and the people who say hello when she passes them in her electric wheelchair.   
Potter says she has struggled with her weight since she was 8 years old. She refers to herself as a “compulsive eater,” who was 400 lbs. when she gave birth to her son, Dillon, now 19. But her struggle often feels like a contradiction, she says, because “I really do have a great life.”  
For now, she’s focused on her goal: making that great life better. “I can’t let it go anymore,” she says. She wants to get her nursing degree and go on a bike ride with her son. She’d like to go to the movies one day and be able to fit in the theater’s chairs.  
“I have let my weight hold me back on so many things,” she says. “I let it hurt me.”  
She adds: “I just need a little push.”

EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Former Husband Of Woman Killed By Pirates 'In Total Shock'/n
The former husband of Jean Adam — one of four people killed by pirates off the coast of Somalia — has exclusively told RadarOnline.com:  “We are in total shock at the moment.”
Officials announced today Tuesday that Jean and her second husband Adam — both of Marina Del Rey, California — as well as Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle were killed by pirates who had hijacked them off the coast of Somalia.
PHOTOS: Stars Who Died In Bizarre Ways 
The Adam’s yacht, the Quest, was being tracked by a U.S. Navy warship, but the navy was unable to prevent their killings.
Jean’s former husband Bill Savage told us: “We are in total shock at the moment. We were told by the authorities earlier today before it was announced on the news.
PHOTOS: Celebs Involved In Murder
“At the moment, our concern are for the children that are left behind.  We have no other comments to make until more information has been gathered.”
Details are still coming in about the incident that led to the murder of the four Americans after a dozen pirates stormed their yacht last Friday; several of the captors were killed in the rescue mission also.
PHOTOS:  Celebs Who Have Done Jail Time
Scott Adam, in his mid-60s, had been an associate producer in Hollywood when he turned in a spiritual direction and enrolled in the seminary a decade ago while his wife was a retired dentist.
On this journey, a Washington couple named Phyllis Mackay and Bob Riggle joined them aboard their yacht.
The four were part of an international yacht race called Blue Water Rally, but for some reason left the course somewhere between India and Oman.
PHOTOS: Celebs Who Died Young
The Adams are part of the Del Rey Yacht Club in Marina del Rey, and the club’s members were also left devastated by the tragic news.
Yacht club member and friend of the Adam’s Earnest Barker is still baffled about why their yacht traveled into the pirate-infested waters off the coast of Somalia in the first place.
He told RadarOnline.com: “We are all devastated. They were a lovely and peaceful couple.
PHOTOS: Friends Gather For Peter Lopez Funeral
“But Scott was a very experienced and professional sailor, and everyone wants to know why he sailed into these waters.
“The authorities must be looking for answers from people taking part in the Blue Water Rally because they must have been the last people in contact with them.
“We last saw then around December time, and they still have a power boat moored here at the Marina.
PHOTOS: Stage For Madonna’s Tour Collapses, Kills One
“They would stay on their yacht when it was moored here and they used it as a base to visit family in Orange County.
“Both Scott and Jean lived for sailing and the church. I’m not angry with the Navy because they probably had no alternative given the circumstances.
“I cannot believe that these so called ‘pirates’ can get away with this and that they can hijack any vessel bearing the American flag.
PHOTOS: Celebs Attend The Funeral Of Tony Curtis
“Hopefully, this will be the last of this kind of incident as America and other countries really crackdown on these pirates all around the world.
“Scott and Jean will be missed they were lovely people who used to enjoy giving seminars at the club about sailing and their travels – this is a sad day for our club.”
Since 2004, the Adams lived on their yacht in Marina Del Rey for about half the year, and the rest of the year they sailed around the world, often distributing Bibles in remote parts of the Fiji Islands, Alaska, New Zealand, Central America and French Polynesia, Johnston said.
PHOTOS: Celebs We Lost In 2010
Scott and Jane Adam documented their maritime missionary work on their website, S/V Quest Adventure Log.
Last week, a Somali pirate was sentenced to 33 years in prison by a New York court for his role in the 2009 hijacking of the Maersk Alabama. There, the ship’s captain was freed when navy sharpshooters killed two pirates.
There are currently 660 sailors being held captive in Somalia, but none of them are American.

The Results Are In: DNA Test Reveals The TRUTH About Prince's Love Child/n
As the battle over Prince‘s $300 million estate continues to rage, RadarOnline.com has learned that DNA tests have been completed on the drug-dealing 39-year-old convict claiming to be the superstar’s “sole heir!”
Patrick Cousins, the lawyer representing Carlin Q. Williams, is allegedly planning to file the results with Minnesota’s Carver County District Court, which authorized using Prince’s blood saved before his cremation.
But first, a Cousins spokesman, Bruce Lewis, is offering journalists the chance to bid for an “exclusive interview” with Williams’ mother, Marsha J. Henson of Kansas City, Missouri who claimed in an affidavit that she had unprotected sex with Prince in 1976 after meeting the star at a hotel.
When asked what she will reveal, Lewis declined to comment. However, he shared his belief that Henson’s information is worth between “$400,000 and $500,000!”
PHOTOS: ‘He Was In Bad Shape’ — Inside Prince’s Struggle With Deadly AIDS
Cousins, who is a former Prince trademark attorney, previously revealed to The National ENQUIRER that he gives credence to Henson’s claims because he was contacted by her son several years prior.
The aspiring rapper, who is doing time in a federal Supermax for a gun offense, “started to inquire about who his father was and his mother reluctantly told him,” Lewis said. “She told him, ‘There’s someone (Cousins) who may be able to help you.'”
When asked if Prince gave Marsha the attorney’s details, Lewis said, “I can’t say any more.”
Williams first publicized his tale months before Prince’s death, posting on Facebook that the singer is “my dad.”
PHOTOS: Seizures, Chronic Pain & Wasting Away: Inside Prince’s Final Days Amid AIDS Bombshell
Court documents obtained by Radar lay out his sordid past: “Mr. Williams’s criminal history started, unsurprisingly, with drug cases. He was convicted of trafficking crack cocaine at age 25 and possession of crack cocaine at 27,” the documents state.
He was busted in 2012 for carrying an illegal firearm while driving a stolen vehicle. While highlighting the wannabe rapper’s history of criminal behavior in the documents, they also noted a history of “violence towards women.”
“At age 31, Williams violated an order of protection and forced his way into an unarmed female’s residence and later he resisted arrest by the officers,” the papers read. “His violence towards women escalated a year later, when he dragged his girlfriend up several stairs, held her captive, and then chased her down the street with a knife threatening to kill her. ”

In another incident, Williams erupted in a violent argument with his girlfriend at the time, the papers claim. According to the report, he got angry after overhearing a conversation his girlfriend was having on January 12, 2010. The victim told police that he then grabbed her and “hit his body against [her] several times.”
Williams has at least two rivals in the scandal: A South Carolina convict, Norman Yates Carthens, who claims he is an adopted son of Prince and a Wisconsin woman, Regina Sorensen, who says she is the rock star’s half sister.
Prince reportedly did not leave a will. If no heir is found, his estate will be distributed to his sister, Tyka Nelson, and five half siblings. /n

“In addition to being a positive and supportive father figure both on and off-screen, Conrad was well-loved and made going to work each day enjoyable for all of us. He will be missed, but never forgotten.”
Bridges, calling Bain the “glue” of the cast, said he’d just talked with the actor last week and everything seemed fine.

 Disney Channel’s Jessie is getting into the nature conservation business – kind of – on Friday’s new episode.
Everyone knows the famous Disney movie, One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Well, Jessie is serving up its own spin on the tale. And Celebuzz has an exclusive first look photo from the episode.
On “101 Lizards,” Ravi’s (Karan Brar) monitor lizard – and link to his homeland, India – becomes a handful with her 12 baby lizards. Of course, he wants to find them the perfect homes for the scaly dozen and Jessie (Debby Ryan) and the other kids are willing to help. But, it isn’t exactly an easy thing to find homes for a lizard that could grow to seven feet.

Plus, the gang thinks that Ms. Chesterfield (Carolyn Hennesy) might have pulled the wool over their eyes by hiring someone to adopt the lizards so that she can turn them into purses and belts. Um, she’s mean, but is she capable of that?
Take a look at our exclusive photo above.
Jessie airs Fridays at 8:30 PM on Disney Channel.

As the world plays the guessing game on which baby is really theirs, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are at home surrounded by family and their healthy daughter, Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher.
“Mila cannot stop crying every time she looks at Wyatt because she is so happy,” a family friend of the That ‘70s Show couple tells RadarOnline.com exclusively.
“She is not even an emotional person!”

However, don’t expect to see them out and about as we have gotten so lucky to lately.
“They are doing everything to ensure that they have total privacy right now, and they are only letting their families close at this time,” the source adds.
As Radar previously reported, the new parents have the tiniest Kutcher’s bedroom all ready to go!

“It’s jungle-themed,” the source said. “It’s decorated green with baby animals.”
Apparently, it’s a great time in Kutcherville, as the Two and a Half Men actor’s sister, Tausha Kutcher, gave birth to a nephew on September 20.
The Jobs star, 36, and his Black Swan fiancé, 31, used the strategy game on Kutcher’s website, Aplus.com, to release their daughter’s name, who was born on September 30 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. /n

Lizzie McGuire is going gangster.Former Friend of Mickey Hilary Duff is set to play one half of notorious bank-robbing duo Bonnie and Clyde in a new indie film.Unlike the classic 1967 flick starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, the new take, titled The Story of Bonnie and Clyde, will focus less on the former's largely fictionalized shoot-'em-ups and more on the actual lives of the Depression-era bandits. Kevin Zegers (The Jane Austen Book Club, Transamerica) will play Duff's partner in crime.Duff will shoot the flick in her downtime from her new NBC series, Barely Legal.Meanwhile, in other action on the casting couch…

Driver plays Swank's law school friend who helps her on the case.• Per Variety,  Brendan Fraser is about to lend his mug to yet another live-action family comedy. Fury Vengeance finds the George of the Jungle thesp playing a real-estate developer whose new housing subdivision encroaches on some angry critters in the pristine Oregon wilderness. Shooting starts this summer. • Jennifer Beals is set to costar with Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and Mila Kunis in The Book of Eli. Helmed by Albert and Allen Hughes, the thriller follows a Mad Max-type loner who battles his way across a futuristic American wasteland to protect a book that may hold the secret to saving humankind. Beals will play Kunis' mother, a blind woman willing to go to extremes to protect her daughter.• Flavor Flav sealing a deal to turn his BET Halloween-themed flick, Nite Tales, into an anthology series. The rapper-turned-reality star will serve as the host of each 30-minute episode, described as Tales From the Crypt meets The Twilight Zone.•Dallas Cowboys' star wide receiver, Terrell Owens, getting his own reality series on VH1 that is set to debut this summer. The news comes a week after his former teammate, Michael Irvin, announced the launch of his own football-themed reality competition for Spike TV that's sort of an NFL version of Survivor premiering this spring.

 Jenny’s Big Day! McCarthy To Wed Fiance Donnie Wahlberg In Chicago Suburb This Weekend.../n
Jenny McCarthy doesn’t have to travel far to marry her boyfriend of more than a year, Donnie Wahlberg.
RadarOnline.com can report that the former View hostess will say “I do” on Sunday evening at the historic Hotel Baker in St. Charles, Illinois, just minutes from McCarthy’s home in five-bedroom home in Geneva.
“Everyone around town has been talking about the wedding,” a local resident tells Radar. “The hotel is closed to the public all weekend.”
According to Chicago’s Courier-News, the 41-year-old blond and her Wahlburgers star fiancé, 45, were spotted on Saturday heading into the posh hotel to begin preparations.
Locals have also reportedly seen Wahlberg’s brothers Paul and Jim, mother Alma, and former New Kids on the Block bandmates Jordan Knight and Danny Wood around town.
PHOTOS:  Jenny McCarthy & Donnie Wahlberg Step Out Together For The First Time
Unfortunately, actor brother Mark Wahlberg was unable to make the festivities, but sent his congratulations in an adorable Instagram video with his wife and four children.
“The national news is reporting they are in New York,” Greater St. Charles Convention and Visitors Bureau executive director Amy Egolf told the newspaper. “We are delighted to have them in St. Charles.”
McCarthy grew up outside Chicago, and after years of living in Los Angeles, she moved back to the Windy City while dating former Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher in 2012.

David Letterman Teams With Netflix for New Interview TV Show/n
David Letterman is returning to TV, but with a Netflix twist. The longtime host of The Late Show will host a new six-episode untitled series for the streaming giant.The untitled series will combine two of Letterman's interests, according to Netflix, "in-depth conversations with extraordinary people, and in-the-field segments expressing his curiosity and humor."Each hour-long episode will feature Letterman conducting long-form conversations with a single guest. Letterman will also explore topics on his own outside of the studio. No premiere date aside from 2018 was announced.

"I feel excited and lucky to be working on this project for Netflix. Here's what I have learned, if you retire to spend more time with your family, check with your family first. Thanks for watching, drive safely," Letterman said in a statement."Just meeting David Letterman was a thrill; imagine how exciting it is for me to announce that we will be working together," Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, said in a statement. "David Letterman is a true television icon, and I can't wait to see him out in the wild, out from behind the desk and interviewing the people he finds most interesting. We'll have to see if he keeps the beard."

Letterman hosted Late Night on NBC and The Late Show on CBS for more than 33 years combined. His hosted episode tally is over 6,000. Letterman has received 52 Emmy nominations with 10 wins. He signed off The Late Show, turning over hosting duties to Stephen Colbert, in a May 20, 2015 episode that attracted close to 14 million viewers.No word if Letterman's now famous beard will be intact for his new Netflix series.

The Secret Is Out! George Clooney's Mom Reveals Twins’ Gender/n
It’s a boy…and a girl!
George Clooney‘s thrilled mother exclusively confirmed to RadarOnline.com that the two-time Oscar winner and his wife Amal are expecting one of each.
“It will be one of each! Yes, a boy and a girl. That’s what I’ve been told,” Nina Clooney, 77, told Radar from her home in Augusta, Kentucky. “How marvelous! My husband and I are extremely excited.”
The excited grandmother added that at 52, the actor — who was a notorious bachelor until he fell for human rights lawyer Amal, 39 — has some catching up to do.

George’s older sister Adelia “has a 20 year old, and a 25 year old,” Nina said with a laugh.
Though George’s mom is clearly in the know, she did admit that the parents-to-be haven’t let her in on one secret about the twins, who are due in June.
“I haven’t been told their names,” she said. “That is George and Amal’s department.”
Radar was first to reveal that the Clooney clan is expanding.
George introduced Amal to his mother and father, veteran TV newsman Nick, one year before they tied the knot in September 2014.

“We couldn’t be happier,” his mom told Radar at the time. “On an intellectual level, they are equals. That is very important to him. Amal’s world couldn’t be more different from the Hollywood lifestyle. They also share a sense of fun, a sense of humor and they are both very caring people.”

For the first time since the accident, Jim was taken outside of the hospital in a wheelchair to be reunited with his dog, Mr Kippy, who was more than ecstatic to see his master. Mr Kippy had been in the car during Jim's head-on collision. Both miraculously survived ... the dog more unscathed than Jim, who is still mending from a broken neck and several other broken bones, as well as collapsed lungs. He already looks better than he did weeks ago./n

Chace Crawford Has a Cow/nChace Crawford was all over midtown Manhattan yesterday donating toys to kids, which was very nice -- but he didn't look all that thrilled about it.He definitely wasn't thrilled to see the paparazzi getting him and his ladylumps, Carrie Underwood, leaving Marquee's fourth anniversary party, where, we're told, they were -- let's just say -- not hiding their mutual affection.

 Tomkat's latest out 'n' about big-toothed doings—are they fer real or just press put-ons? Hmmm. Let's conjure that baby, along with Star  Jones Reynolds' latest look-at-me mush, while we also get to some always genuine gab—your bitchy back talk! 

Oh, darlings, just some D-list sightings (Simon Rex, Tom Cruise, jokers like that) from round the nation before we get to you barkin’ bitches in this week’s mailbag. Ready to live hardly vicariously?

'Cause this nonrompin' road show Tom 'n' Katie are still on is really beginning to bore me somethin' fierce. There they were, the couple with the leastest, at Mentor L.A.'s Promise Gala at Fox studios, Century City. K.C. was ultrathin, ramrod erect and exquisitely coiffed in a flowy white top and black pants. Funny thing, though: Whenever Mrs. Cee posed with her hubby, she stooped down, lowering her towering bod. Think that was one of the myriad instructions Katie-poo was showered with, once she signed up for Camp Cruise? Prolly.

Once inside the event (past the looky-loos of the red carpet), Mistuh and Mrs. Cee had “zero” chemistry between them (though some of their staunchest defenders say that's just how they are) as they sat, staring blankly apart, saying nothing to each other as they gazed at permahotties Demi 'n' Ashton. Uh, trouble already, you two?

 Far more vivacious—and this one's gonna kill me to say so—over on a diff coast was former View merchandise-siphoning siren Star  Jones Reynolds. She's been celebrating her B-day, hitting the Hotel Victor, the Delano with Jamie Foxx (last week), then she hauled her supposedly nonsurgeried behind over to the Sagamore, where she totally ate up a birthday shout-out from Robin Thicke at his concert. S.J.R. was quite dismissive to a fan who requested an autograph and pic (Reynolds should be thanking gawd these stupid creatures still exist on the planet), snapping at the poor boy: "Oh, honey, no. We're not doing that." Fool! Who the eff does she think's gonna watch her four-eyed phony self on CNN? An ABC life with all the network PR trimmings, dear, this ain't gonna be. 

Oh, and Simon Rex, still looking soft-porn perf, hit the stage at the Sagamore to do his best white rapper thang—"bitch" this, "bitch" that—very K-Fed wannabe white trash, insisted Desk SoBe (that would be my bitch, film writer Martin Haro).Why do straight white dudes in wife-beaters yelling nasty-ass crap outta their pusses think that gets the babes all hot ‘n’ ready? Don’t they know they need to put their mouths where there privates want to be, and shut the hell up?Speaking of no action, S.J.R. made the South Beach rounds without that personage she married once. Wonder why?

Dear Ted:Am I the only person on the planet that thinks Victoria Beckham is the most hideous thing in Jimmy Choos? I just don't get it. Yuck.  Victoria  Danville, California

Dear Snit Fits:Oh darling, glad you agree, and don’t you dare feel bad about your moniker! I mean, come on, I share my name with a closeted Evangelical preacher who dabbles in drugs and hookers, Ted Haggard. Worse than bloody Posh, for sure!

Dear Ted:From this beautiful black girl, I have to say...Beyoncé is completely overexposed. Even if you didn't say it, I will! Was I the only one thinking those were not tears of joy when J.Hud picked up her Oscar? B. can sing, but that's about where the hero worship ends for me.  Aeol  NYC

Dear Dollface:Couldn’t agree more, hon! Obviously the girl’s got pipes, but acting chops...not so much.

Dear Ted:You got to tell me! Is Randy Rubber Sean Penn?  Paul  Fall River, Massachusetts

Dear Nice Pry:Not a terrible guess, but not too close either. Think younger, less hair.

Dear Ted:I read on another gossip site that you are a Scientologist. Say it ain't so!  Angela  Indianapolis

Dear Deluded:Don’t you worry, Angie, I’m not drinking any Tom Cruise-Aid. That ain’t the delicious stuff from T.C. that interests me at all.

Dear Ted:Blood E. Nostril = Claire Danes?  Amy  Washington, Indiana

Dear Short 'n' Sweet: Wrong-a-rooney...Think younger, more bitchin’ bod. Way.

 Dear Ted:   Why do you always talk about stars being gay? Why do all homosexuals think everyone else is in the closet? I am fully supportive of anyone's sexual preference, to each his own, but I think your view that, like, 90 percent of Hollywood is gay or cross-dressing is a bit far-fetched.   Ronnie   Newport Beach, California 

Dear Numerically Naive:Oh, doll, your numbers are so off—it’s not 90 percent, 50-50 is more like it: Half are gay, the other half just haven’t told their publicists yet.

 Dear Ted:      Has Toothy Tile or any of the other Blind Vicers ever indicated to you that he knows you're talking about him (as in, "Write anything more, Casablanca, and you'll never Awful-speak again")?    John   Boston 

Dear Blind on the Mind:Yes, Toothy know he’s Toothy. And he’s proud of it! (Quelle surprise.) 

Dear Ted:Did Leonardo DiCaprio say that he was gay? Someone told me he came out of the closet this year, and I watch E! all the time and didn't hear that. Thank you.  Beverly  Elnora, Indiana

Dear Misinformed: No, doll, that was Jared Leto. And he was joking.

 Dear Ted: Thanks for the Decoder on the word tranny. I always thought it was short for "transmission." Could be a car transmission; could be the transmission of the kinda disease you don't tell your mama about.   Marge   Beloved Waterbury, Connecticut 

Dear Decoder Diva:Trust me, there’s enough of the latter kinda transmissions you’re referring to around here in hot-to-hump Hollywood!  

Dear Ted:Okay, I just have to be crude here, but are John Mayer and Derek Jeter gifted with long tongues and the ability to breathe through their ears?  Kim  Raleigh, North Carolina  

Dear Tongue-Waggin’ Wanderer:Darling, you were hardly crass in your query! And I’ve got no idea how good or bad John or Derek are at goin’ downtown, so no, that’s not their common interest.

Dear Ted:Someone should slap Liz Hurley. She goes to one of the poorest countries on the planet and wastes a fortune on her 26th wedding? More proof that money doesn't buy class. Hey Ted, how long would you say the marriage will last? I figure four to six weeks.  Alison  Los Angeles

Dear Heated over Hurley:It is a little tacky, isn’t it? They could at least make a big fat donation or something afterward, à la Angelina. I give them four months.

 Dear Ted: Another photo of Paris Hilton and yet even more press coverage? What...you can't go even a week without mentioning her name or making us look at her? (Ugh!)  Okay, your readers are now convinced you must be on the Hilton payroll.   Gen   Boston 

Dear Way Wrong:Just because Kathy Hilton has me on speed dial doesn’t mean either of us take the calls, darlin’.

Dear Ted:Botox-Bang = Helen Hunt. That's an easy one, no?  Steve  Boston

Dear Smarty Pants:Easy to get wrong, maybe! Think younger, more fresh faced, less accomplished.

Dear Ted:Okay, I think I finally have one of these right! Is Blood E. Nostril Anne Hathaway? She can't be the "Princess" she seems to be!  Jennifer  Hickory, North Carolina                               

Dear Pun Stunner:Very good guess, my crumb-smooch, as Anne does have that squeaky-clean rep down pat, but alas, she ain’t your gal. Think more of a tabloid target...at least lately.

Dear Ted:    I think Blood E. Nostril is no other than Tiffani Thiessen. She always played a good girl on Saved by the Bell, and now all the characters she plays are totally different. Please tell me I am right on this one!!  Chris  Hilliard, Ohio

Dear Wishful Thinking:Is poor Tiffers even on anyone’s radar anymore? She’s certainly not the gal we’re gossin’ about, ‘kay?

Mila Kunis can't spend all her time with boyfriend Ashton Kutcher, right?The stunning star was snapped taking her parents, Elvira and Mark, to dinner at a Greek restaurant in the London town of Hampstead, where the 29-year-old actress is living while on location shooting her upcoming flick Jupiter Ascending.Coincidentally, Kunis' costar Channing Tatum was at the movies next door, watching Matthew McConaughey's new film Mud with pregnant wife Jenna Dewan.

Earlier in the day, Kunis went for a romantic stroll with boyfriend Ashton Kutcher, and it appears the brunette beauty decided to don the same casual attire for dinner.Although Ashton wasn't present for the family outing, the Two and a Half Men star has been spending ample time with Kunis' parents.The happy couple recently joined Mila's mom and dad for a performance of Billy Elliott: The Musical, and Kutcher was also snapped spending time with his girlfriend's parents last summer.Hmmm...seems like the former That '70s Show costars are getting serious!

Blake Lively Slams Woody Allen Rape Jokes, Calls The Director 'Empowering'/n
Blake Lively may gain some more enemies this week after defending Cafe Society director Woody Allen regarding his past sex abuse scandals.
In fact, despite Allen’s controversial reputation when it comes to women in Hollywood, Lively even called the film veteran “empowering.”
“It’s really cool to work with a director who’s done so much because he knows exactly what he wants,” the 28-year-old said in an interview with Hamptons magazine. “The fact that he does one shot for an entire scene — [and] this could be a scene with eight people and one to two takes — it gives you a level of confidence because when he’s got it, he knows he’s got it.”

“He also is really encouraging as to why he cast you, so he’ll say, ‘Say the dialogue that’s written and then you can improvise for a while.’ And his dialogue is so specific, and it’s speaking in a 1930s dialect and [with period] references, so it’s intimidating to think, Oh, let me just improvise there and hope that my words blend seamlessly alongside Woody Allen’s,” she continued. “Which they clearly wouldn’t and don’t. But he’s very empowering.”
The actress, now pregnant with her second child with husband Ryan Reynolds, then slammed comedian Laurent Lafitte, who made a controversial rape joke about Allen during the Cannes Film Festival opening ceremony last month.
“I think any jokes about rape, homophobia or Hitler is not a joke,” she told Variety on May 12. “I think that was a hard thing to swallow in 30 seconds. Film festivals are such a beautiful, respectful festivals of film and artists and to have that, it felt like it wouldn’t have happened if it was in the 1940s. I can’t imagine Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby going out and doing that. It was more disappointing for the artists in the room that someone was going up there making jokes about something that wasn’t funny.”

Lively may find little support from the ladies, however, as actresses like Lena Dunham have spoken out against Allen many times in the past.
“Woody Allen is proof that people don’t think everything he says in his films is stuff that he does, because all he was doing was making out with 17-year-olds for years and we didn’t say anything about it,” Dunham previously said of the director. “And then he did it — a bunch. No one went that Woody Allen is making out with a 17-year-old in Manhattan and I guess he’s a real perv; and then lo and behold.”
To make matters worse, Allen’s possible transgressions were in the news after his stepdaughter, Dylan, wrote a NYT piece accusing him of sexually assaulting her. (Allen denied the claims.)

NFL Star Brandon Jacobs -- My 1st Action Movie ... With Fight Scenes & Gun Battle!!/nVernon Davis ain't the only NFL star trying to make the jump to the big screen -- former NY Giants running back Brandon Jacobs just shot his 1st movie ... complete with a real FIGHT SCENE!!The project is called  "The Grievance Group " -- in which Jacobs plays the leader of a militant army trying to protect his community. He's pretty bad ass ... he yells at a bunch of people, fights a guy in army fatigues and (pretends) to fire a heavy duty machine gun. We spoke with the film's director Rob Hawk who tells us they started shooting the flick about 7 months ago in New Jersey -- and he's almost finished with production. Hawk says the movie will open in 20 theaters on the East Coast in September and hopes it expands from there.  As for Brandon, we're told he's got a real interest in acting -- and hopes this role can springboard his acting career.We're told Brandon got paid $10k for 2 days of shooting -- but worked about 16 hours per day. Hawk says Jacobs is not only a pro on set -- he's one of the nicest guys ever./n
 'Violent' & 'Screaming Incoherently!' Maxwell & Caroline Kennedy's Disturbing.../n
What would late President John F. Kennedy think?
Maxwell Kennedy had “noticeably bloodshot and glassy eyes,” and his daughter told cops to “f**k of,” when they were arrested on disorderly conduct charges, according to the shocking police report obtained exclusively by RadarOnline.com.
The late Robert F. Kennedy‘s son, 52, and granddaughter, 22, were taken into custody by Massachusetts’ Hyannisport Police on Sunday, August 20, at about 1 am et after cops were called to a party house by neighbors reporting a noise complaint.
The shocking police documents detail Maxwell resisting arrest, his daughter trying to free him from the police car, and her cursing to the cops as she was booked into jail.
READ THE SHOCKING POLICE REPORT
“Maxwell Kennedy came to the door and immediately became angry with me,” Officer Armando Feliciano claimed in the official papers obtained by Radar.
“I asked Kennedy to provide some identification. He became even more irate with me. I observed Kennedy to have noticeably bloodshot  and glassy eyes and he was sweating profusely during our conversation,” the officer alleged about the Harvard graduate.
“Kennedy was yelling at me not to enter the house,” the cop noted. “As I moved closer to the door, Kennedy continued to yell and scream at me and refused any corporation whatsoever. He told me to leave.”
PHOTOS: Remembering the Kennedys
“He appeared to be very unsteady on his feet and his movements were erratic. I advised him that I was responding to a noise complaint and I needed to identify the person in charge of the home. Kennedy only pointed his finger at my chest and refused any sort of civil communication. Neither Kennedy, nor the other party guest, made any effort whatsoever to stop the disturbance (only turning the music back up during our conversation).”
The police officer allegedly observed Maxwell’s agitated behavior as he attempted to enter the house to end the noise disturbance.
“Kennedy responded by now screaming incoherently and throwing himself at the wall. When he hit the wall, he grabbed the wall cabinet (filled with glass valuables) and threw it smashing the contents. I attempted to ask Kennedy why he was acting like this.”

The police report claimed Kennedy resisted the cop.
“I advised Kennedy that he was not under arrest and I attempted to place handcuffs and Kennedy due to his violent and tumultuous behavior and refusal to stop the ongoing disturbance. Kennedy attempted to pull away by stiffening both of his arms. I told him to relax his arms. He refused. Kennedy again pulled his arms from me making it difficult for me to place him in custody.
“I observed that we were surrounded by everyone in the room. They were yelling ‘you don’t know who you’re messing with’ and ‘he was the district attorney.'”
The officer then claimed the young Caroline Kennedy was arrested for her own behavior. “I observed a female grab hold of my cruiser door and open it. I recognized her as one of the party guest from in the house. As she opened the door I rushed to cruiser as the crowd closed in. I was able to get the door closed, but this had now flared up the crowd even more. Everywhere I turned there were cell phone camera flashing lights in my face and people were yelling and flailing their arms.”

In the report, the officer then explained why Caroline Kennedy was arrested. “I observed a female grab hold of my cruiser door and open it. I recognized her as one of the party guest from in the house. As she opened the door I rushed to cruiser as the crowd closed in. I was able to get the door closed, but this had now flared up the crowd even more. Everywhere I turned there were cell phone camera flashing lights in my face and people were yelling and flailing their arms.”
He blamed the father and daughter duo from the famous family, saying they “incited this crowd into an angry mob.”
Sergeant Jason Laber wrote a report about booking Caroline into custody.

“I observed a female to slur her words and had glassy bloodshot eyes. She was unsteady on her feet and was dirty (dirt of knees and feet). During the process I asked if she would like to have a breathalyzer she refused and said “No, I’m drunk… I know.”
She allegedly told the officer her identity and said, “I went to Brown and I’m a teacher, sweetheart.” Sgt. Laber noted: “She stuck her tongue out and repeatedly told me to ‘f*** off’ during booking. She cried and now asked if this would affect her job.”
He wrote that she said “she did not know it was against the law to open a police car door.”
Despite Maxwell allegedly having “glassy bloodshot eyes,” and “sweating profusely,” he took a breathalyzer that registered .00 BAC.
He and his daughter were released on bai,l and appeared in court on the charges. A court date is set for November.

Adam Lambert 'Would Love to Come Back' to American Idol
/n

Adam Lambert welcomes Katy Perry to the show!
American Idol‘s superstar alumni — who was runner up on the eighth season of the reality TV hit and has since toured with legendary rock group Queen — can’t wait to see the pop star sit at the judges’ panel for the show’s reboot.
“I think she’ll be great. She has a long history with the show, too,” he told Entertainment Tonight on Saturday about the first judge to be announced for the comeback.
The popular singing competition is set to return in 2018 on ABC, and while Lambert says he has not yet been approached to revisit the place where he rose to fame, the successful alumni says he “would love to come back.”
“When [American Idol] was on Fox I was there every season,” he added. “I would come on and do something. I owe the show great debt of gratitude. I love the show. I think it’s great. I would love to come back and pop in.”
Lambert’s advice to the next generation of Idol prospects? “You gotta find something that makes you stand out from the pack a bit,” he says.
“What makes you different than everybody else? What’s your angle? What’s your lane? I mean, that’s the music industry in general.”
“And also find something that isn’t too complicated or challenging for the judges, especially right away,” he continued. “You have to help them understand who you could be on the show.”

Kendall Jenner Shopping for New Home after Stalker and Robbery Issues /nKendall Jenner learned the hard way that you should always listen to mom ... she's looking for a new home after some super scary encounters with criminals. We've learned Kendall wants out of the neighborhood after an alleged stalker followed her right up her driveway. She was also robbed blind by someone who got into her bedroom and took $200k in jewelry. Kendall is clearly doing well for herself. She bought her current home a year ago, just above the Sunset Strip, for $6.5 million. She's now looking for homes with a much higher price point -- $15 MILLION! She's looking on the Westside of L.A. -- Bel Air and Bev Hills. As we reported, Kris Jenner never wanted Kendall to buy the home she's in, because it's not gated and it's located in an area where lots of people show up late at night for after-parties following a night on the Strip./n
Tamra Judge Mourns Loss Of Estranged Daughter In Explosive 'RHOC' Meltdown/n
Shannon Beador‘s screaming fight with Kelly Dodd started off episode four of the Real Housewives of Orange County with a bang, but Tamra Judge‘s emotional state over her estranged daughter ended the show on a sad note.
“She freaked the f**k out and she needs to apologize to me. But she can never ever take ownership for her behavior,” Dodd opens the show saying about Beador, who seems truly ashamed of her behavior from the previous episode.
“I can’t let someone like that get under my skin,” Beador tells Tamra Judge. “I really beat myself up the next day. I’m going to be embarrassed for a while.”
Dodd and her husband discuss the ugly situation and come to the conclusion that Dodd and Beador could be friends, if Judge wasn’t always interfering.

“We have a new puppet master,” Michael Dodd states.
Beador sums up the fight: “The not so quiet women were at The Quiet Woman.”
The screen switches to Dodd dragging Vicki Gunvalson along for her vaginal rejuvenation surgery.
“I’m a little leaky down there,” Dodd admits. “I’m hoping the tightening of the puss makes everything better for everybody.”
PHOTOS: Tamra Barney Custody Case — 15 Shocking Allegations
“I’m here to get my sn***h tightened,” she announces as she enters the doctor’s office. Gunvalson isn’t exactly comfortable getting so close to Dodd’s private parts.
“I don’t want to see anything. I don’t want to see any pink parts. I don’t want to smell anything. I don’t want to know what’s going on down there!” She tells her friend.
For some comic relief, Beador takes her 15-year-old daughter Sophie for a driving lesson, on a Range Rover. From erratic lane changes to a stop sign/stop light confusion, Sophie almost gives her mother a heart attack with her out-of-control driving, nonetheless reminding her “We’re alive aren’t we?”
Some of the women get together at Lydia McLaughlin‘s son’s eighth birthday party where Gunvalson meets Peggy Sulahain for the first time. The newest housewife tells Gunvalson about her mastectomy which elicits a measured response from the OG from the OC.

“Anything you need you have my number, help with your kids,” she offers Sulahain, but in her confessional sings a different tune.
“After my situation with Brooks, I kind of feel like health issues should be kept private. I’m here for her to have her talk about it. I’m not the one who is going to start researching or asking for records. No, hands off on this one.”
Switching scenes, Judge has a heart to heart with her son, Ryan Vieth, who reveals that his sister Sidney was at his house recently. He says he told her: “You’re missing so much sh*t. You’re missing everything.”
Judge admits that her relationship with her ex was on the mend. “My past with Simon has been bad. But now my relationship with Simon is so much better. He realizes and I realize that we need to come together because the way that we are living now is not good.”

Judge describes seeing Sidney at her son’s house. “Do you understand that’s the first time I’ve fricking hugged my daughter without being in court in four years? I looked at her and said ‘I don’t even know you.'”
Vieth then tells his mom that his relationship with Simon Barney was detrimental to him, but that as a parent/step-parent now he understands.
“I do relate to Simon. I even spoke highly of him the other day. The girls weren’t doing their chores. I told them I had a step dad who was an a**hole,” and then he bursts into tears.
“It makes me feel good that he’s growing up,” Judge says and as she cries Vieth says: “I get why Simon was such a prick to me.”

Judge then jokes with her son: “Sometimes you gotta show your mangina.”
Meghan Edmonds appears for a brief moment, introducing her new nanny (a young blonde) and meeting with Dodd after their last fight.
“I just cut Kelly Dodd out for a few months. It is a lot easier to get along with Kelly than fight with her.”
Edmonds is shocked by Dodd’s fight with Beador. “The way that Kelly goes after people is not normal,” she admits.
PHOTOS: Rossi’s Revenge! Inside Gretchen & Fiancé Slade Smiley’s Shocking New Reality Show
Gunvalson visits Sulahain at her immense mansion and surmises that the two will be fast friends after Sulahian breaks down over the death of her parents.
Judge’s emotional night giving a speech with the Erasing Families group ends the show on a heartbreaking note.
Her own father shows up and she admits that she took her mother’s side in the divorce, alienating him in favor of her mother. But her mother doesn’t attend the event, crushing Judge before she goes.
“Being erased from your child’s life, you instantly feel like a bad parent,” she describes. “People don’t realize it is happening to 22 million people in the world.”
PHOTOS: Take That Brooks! Vicki Gunvalson Takes New Boyfriend On Exotic Trip With Family
She breaks down in tears about her mother’s absence. “It hurts my feelings that my mom didn’t think it was important enough to show up.”
Judge cries through the speech that she gives, telling the group she was “Honored and sadden to stand here. I have lived the past three and a half years in silent pain. People tell you all the time, ‘Don’t worry, she’ll be back.’ Everytime someone says that, I want to punch them in the face.”
Sidney’s mother continues, sobbing as she says: “I do believe that my daughter will be back one day. Just like I believe your children will be back one day. Love your children more than you hate your ex. Kids deserve to have both parents in their lives.”

Jason Sudeikis Reveals that Beyoncé Sent Olivia Wilde into Labor/n





                    Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis Welcome a Baby Girl!
                







Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis added to their growing family this week!

Jason Sudeikis and Olivia Wilde’s 2-year-old son Otis has a pretty well-documented obsession with Beyoncé, but with the arrival of little Daisy, it looks like there may be some competition in the Sudeikis household over who’s the biggest Bey fan.

Earlier today (Oct. 21, 2016), Sudeikis stopped by Harry Connick Jr.‘s talk show Harry, to apologize for missing his previously scheduled appearance due to the birth of his daughter Daisy. “I was supposed to be here at 4,” the newly minted father-of-two explained. “She came out at 3:39. She does not care about show business, but she will!”
Sudeikis revealed that he almost made it to his original time slot because Wilde almost gave birth a few days earlier! “We came really close,” Sudeikis revealed. “Daisy was born on Tuesday, but on Friday night, [Olivia] and I were going out—date night. This is how confident of a lady Olivia is: She’s like, ‘Date night, we’re going to go see Beyoncé.'”
“We came really close,” Sudeikis revealed. “Daisy was born on Tuesday, but on Friday night, [Olivia] and I were going out—date night. This is how confident of a lady Olivia is: She’s like, ‘Date night, we’re going to go see Beyoncé.'”

“So, we were in line to get in the Lincoln Tunnel and there was an accident in there. Everything was gummed up, so it was going to take us like an hour to get through the tunnel, and we would have been a half hour late to the concert, which would have been a bummer because we would miss all the choreography and fireworks.”
Just as the couple made the decision to turn around and go home, Wilde began having contractions.
“I don’t know if it was the pressure, if it was the traffic or the fact that we were going to be late. It was just bad in the back seat of the car,” he explained. “We U-turned and got it out of there. We figured it would be a bad scene to have the baby in a tunnel—and a little redundant!”
Sudeikis said that when they arrived back in their neighborhood, they took a long walk and Daisy eventually calmed down and stayed put until Friday. “I think she was just fired up,” he joked. “Just sitting there doing the [‘Single Ladies’] dance, like, ‘I know where I’m going!'”

LOL!

The 89th annual Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday (Feb. 26, 2017) was peppered with political commentary and highlighted the best theater snack delivery system we should’ve patented.

That’s right. All of the sudden host Jimmy Kimmel was like, “Hey, let’s have some snacks!” and little parachutes full of candy fell out of the sky. It was magical and made us really hungry, but let’s focus on the awards, shall we?

La La Land took Best Picture… until it didn’t. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway misread the envelope and Moonlight actually won. More on that below. Take a look at the full list of winners over on Variety or keep scrolling to see videos of the biggest moments of the night.
Justin Timberlake opened the show with an electric performance of “Can’t Stop the Feeling” Trolls:


Kimmel “buried the hatchet” with Matt Damon, prodded President Donald Trump, and made Meryl Streep hide in her chair by jokingly citing all of the “overrated” moments in her outstanding career history:


Mahershala Ali became the first Muslim actor to win an Academy Award. He thanked his wife, who gave birth to their daughter just four days earlier, in his acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actor in Moonlight:

Scott Disick Makes Shocking Confession Amid Downward Spiral: 'I'm A Sex Addict!'/n
Has Scott Disick finally hit rock bottom?
As the self-described Lord parties harder than ever, he made a startling confession last night on the latest episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.
On the family’s vacation in Costa Rica, the Kardashian sisters discovered that Kourtney’s baby daddy brought a hookup on the wholesome trip.
Kourtney confronted her troubled ex over dinner with sisters Kim and Khloe, mom Kris, and Kris’ on-off boyfriend, Corey Gamble.’

“There’s a level of respect and appropriateness that just should be known,” Kourtney, 38, seethed with her mother and sisters in support.
“Every night you go to bed with our kids, and I go to bed alone, sad and miserable,” Scott responded.
“Stop playing the victim!” Kourtney snapped.

When the family asked him how he could not go four days without a random girl accompanying him to bed, the rehab alum played the addiction card.
“I’m a sex addict!” the 33-year-old screamed. “I’m a f**ked up, horrible sex addict.”
However, he later admitted to the cameras that he wasn’t exactly being genuine.

Chris Soules, Don't Call Person Who Died in Crash 'Victim'/nFormer 'Bachelor' and current defendant Chris Soules wants to block the jury in his felony hit-and-run trial from hearing anyone refer to the deceased as a  "victim. " TMZ broke the story ... Chris plowed into a tractor driven by a man named Kenneth Moser who died as a result of his injuries. Chris left the scene before cops arrived and he's been charged with leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death. According to new legal docs, Chris' lawyers think it would be grossly unfair to call Moser a  "victim, " Chris has not been charged or even ticketed for the causing the accident. Soules' lawyers also want the judge to nix any evidence that Chris bought or consumed alcohol the day of the crash. As we reported, when cops arrived at his house shortly after the accident, he refused to come out and it took several hours to get a search warrant. When Chris was belatedly tested his specimens were negative for drugs and alcohol./n

Michelle Carter Sobs As Judge Says ‘Her Conduct Caused The Death Of Conrad Roy’/n
Michelle Carter has been found guilty for the death of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, who killed himself after receiving thousands of text messages from her encouraging him to commit suicide.
Judge Lawrence Moniz read the verdict in the Massachusetts court on Friday, June 16, 2017, as Carter broke down alongside her attorneys.
“The court finds that instructing Mr. Roy to get back into the truck, which constitutes wanton and reckless conduct by Miss Carter[sic],” he said as Carter sobbed in the courtroom.
Carter notoriously texted Roy to “get back in” when he was attempting to gas himself in his truck and had second thoughts. He ultimately died inside the vehicle.

“When Miss Carter realized Roy exited the truck she instructed him to reenter the truck,” the judge noted.
“She is mindful that the process [of killing himself] in the truck will take approximately 15 minutes,” he said.
“She instructed Mr. Roy to get back into the truck, well knowing all of the feelings he has exchanged [about suicide.]”
Carter will be sentenced at a later date as a juvenile, but will be allowed to remain free on bail. In the meantime, she is prohibited from contact the Roy family.
“She did not issue a simple additional instruction to get out of the truck,” the judge said.

“The court now finds you guilty on the indictment charging.”
He told the court that prosecutors had “proven their case. Her actions and her failure to act … constituted each and all wanton and reckless conduct. Her conduct caused the death of Mr. Roy.”
The trial exposed the full extent of the chilling messages exchanged between the troubled pair.
Pushing him to commit the horrible act, Carter wrote at one point in texts entered into evidence, “You’re gonna have to prove me wrong because I just don’t think you really want [to commit suicide]. You just keeps pushing it off to another night and say you’ll do it but you never do.”

Another text message she sent to her boyfriend before his death read, “You are ready and prepared, all you need to do is turn on the generator [inside his truck to gas himself] and you will be free and happy.”
Carter also wrote to Roy, “I thought you wanted to do this. The time is right and you’re ready, you just need to do it! You can’t keep living this way. You just need to do it like you did last time and not think about it and just do it babe. You can’t keep doing this every day.”
The sentencing recommendation will be issued in July.

Here’s Why Stores Can’t Keep Elmer’s Glue on Their Shelves/n
A gooey substance known simply as “slime” is the new must-have item among tweens, and the trend is causing a shortage of its main ingredient: Elmer’s glue.
The homemade concoction is closer in texture to the jiggly “Gak” sold by Nickelodeon in the 1990s than the dripping green liquid the TV network regularly dumped on kids and celebrities, which is called slime. It’s simple to make (instructional videos can be found on YouTube) and requires only a few household items, often jazzed up with food coloring and glitter.

The massive popularity of the craft, which “went mainstream” at the end of 2016, according to the Wall Street Journal, has also had a significant impact on craft glue sales. Elmer’s glue sales doubled in December as how-to videos began to go viral on social media, WSJ reports. And Elmer’s marketing director told the newspaper that the company has increased glue production to meet the demand and devoted teams to developing slime videos and new products.

Many young slime makers, however, maintain that the homemade stuff is better than store-bought versions, and the mass at-home manufacturing of the colorful goo has caused glue shortages in some areas. In New Jersey, a mom of three told local outlet Tap Into Westfield that Target has been sold out for weeks. She told the site she learned about the crafting craze after her daughter’s first-grade teacher sent home a note asking her to bring in more glue.

Borax, another ingredient in many slime recipes, and cornstarch, a necessity for making a similar concoction called oobek, have also been harder to come by, the site reports.
One benefit of the sticky situation: the in-demand birthday gift for middle schoolers this year will likely be an industrial-size bucket of glue.

Justin Bieber Dating Hailee Steinfeld /n12:20 PM PT -- A rep for Hailee says she and Justin are friends. That's her side of it. Our sources are clear ... their relationship has left the friend zone.Justin Bieber's moved on to a new Hailey -- different spelling though because he's now dating singer and actress Hailee Steinfeld ... TMZ has learned. It's all still fresh. Our sources tell us they've only been seeing each other for a little over a month -- though that's a lot in Bieber's world. We're told they were introduced by pastor Carl Lentz. They both attend his church. Last month, JB dropped a giant clue things were heating up between them when he was photographed mid-FaceTime with the  "Pitch Perfect 2 " star. Justin's in NYC now and we're told they met up after Hailee went to the Met Gala ... solo./n
Mike "Rowdy" Wallace Busted/n
        Who would have guessed 60 Minutes man Mike Wallace was a ticking time bomb?                But, according to New York's finest, the normally erudite CBS newsman melted down Tuesday night. He was slapped into handcuffs and hauled off to jail Tuesday after he allegedly lunged at a city inspector during a parking dispute.                But Wallace and some eyewitnesses say the iconic telejournalist may have been the victim of overzealous traffic cops. And now the mayor's chimed in, announcing the arrest will be investigated.                The CBS correspondent's troubles began while picking up a meat loaf dinner at a Manhattan restaurant while his driver double-parked outside. The octogenarian emerged from Luke's Bar & Grill as two Taxi and Limousine Commission inspectors were questioning his driver. According to authorities, things got out of hand when Wallace interrupted the inspectors and became "overly assertive and disrespectful."                A TLC spokesperson maintains that after being asked three times to step away from the vehicle, "Wallace appeared to lunge toward one of the two inspectors. The other inspector became concerned with his partner's safety and at that point cuffed Mr. Wallace."                That's not how Wallace tells it. Speaking on WFAN's Imus in the Morning show, he said "I asked what's going on, and they kept telling me to get back in the car. Then they arrested me and took me to the 19th Precinct."                "I'm an 86-year-old man," Wallace told the New York Post. "For whatever reason, this guy and his buddy were intent upon telling me that I was interfering with the execution of the law."              Mayor Michael Bloomberg also questioned the bust. "Why a man in his 80s was so threatening that they had to arrest him when they normally don't arrest anybody certainly gives you cause to ask the question," Bloomberg said at his daily press briefing Wednesday.                    "Why he'd have to be handcuffed and led away, or whatever happened, I don't know, but you can rest assured we will be looking into it."             Just about the only thing everyone can agree on are the booking details. The 60 Minutes godfather was taken to the 19th Precinct station house, where he was issued a summons for disorderly conduct and released. He's due in court in October.                 Finding eyewitnesses to back the TV personality shouldn't be a problem. Several were quoted in Newsday saying the inspectors overreacted and that the gathering crowd booed as Wallace was arrested.                Ernesto Cavalli, who owns the restaurant next door, claims Wallace was simply asking what happened when "the TLC officer grabbed his shirt and pushed him very strongly against the car and handcuffed him." Cavalli said the inspector then turned to the crowd and said, "Anybody else?"                At the time of the arrest, CBS released a statement saying Wallace was home and "is fine." No further information has been released by the network, and Wallace's spokesperson, Richard Leibner, offered "no comment" when reached Wednesday morning.

Kehlani Reveals She's 'Still Very Much Sick' After Onstage Breakdown/n

Poor Kehlani.
On Monday evening, the Gangsta singer was slated to perform a concert in Grand Rapids, MI but was unable to do so as she was having some sort of a breakdown. The 22-year-old fought back tears as she came on stage and told fans she had to cancel the performance because she felt "crazy" and had to go to the hospital.

It's said the California native was not only dressed down, but also clearly distraught as she vowed to  refund the audience's tickets if she was unable to reschedule the concert.
Of course, this emotional episode comes a year after Kehlani was placed on a 5150 hold.
In case you forgot, authorities deemed the hitmaker was a threat to herself after she tried to commit suicide following those hurtful rumors that she had cheated on Kyrie Irving.
The Good Life singer has since addressed her latest stint in the hospital with a statement on Instagram. On Tuesday, the songwriter posted:

Well that's good to hear. We're wishing Kehlani only the best as she gets the help she needs.

Cait Jenner Hasn't Talked To Stepdaughter Kim In A 'Long Time': 'I Keep My Distance'/n
Caitlyn Jenner‘s memoir, The Secrets Of My Life, has cause quite the stir among the Kardashians — including the star’s former ally Kim Kardashian!
During an interview with the Today show on Thursday, the 67-year-old revealed that she’s been steering clear of her stepdaughter ever since she slammed the former Olympian’s biography on Ellen DeGeneres‘s show last month.
When asked further about the situation, Jenner confessed, “Well, to be honest with you, I really haven’t talked to her in a long time. I’ve kind of let everything calm down. So I kind of stay — you know, I keep my distance.”

“I’m out right now trying to make a difference in the world, I live in a very marginalized community where the murder rate is out of control.”
Of course, Jenner insisted she’s still fond of Kardashian.
“I love Kimberly, I think she’s a wonderful person, we have a very good relationship.”

As Radar readers know, Jenner’s tell-all book sent ex Kris Jenner and the rest of the Kardashian family flying off the handle.
“I read it and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time,” Kris fumed to daughters Kim and Khloe on a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. “None of it makes sense. Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch and an a*****e?”

Caitlyn Jenner -- Swingin' at the Golf Course (PHOTO)/nCaitlyn Jenner eschewed the reality cameras and any sort of glitz or glamour to practice her swing Monday ... at a plain old public golf course. Jenner showed up at the Westlake Golf Course around noon and stayed for an hour. We're told she mostly kept to herself and worked on her short game and practiced off the tee at the driving range. We're told Caitlyn -- who was dressed very casually -- was pulling clubs from a golf bag with  "Bruce Jenner " emblazoned on it.   Caitlyn, not surprisingly, was cranking the ball farther than any of the other players ... men and women. When Caitlyn decides to get serious again, she'll have to re-register her handicap with the USGA as a woman. Bruce played at a very high skill level and Caitlyn will probably improve her handicap because of her gender./n

 The mark of any high school story told on television is usually in the power of its romance. Young kids watch and want to imagine they’ll find just as swoon-worthy a guy or girl in their own school, too. That’s what’s being explored on this week’s episode of Oxygen’s The Glee Project.
Everything from first time jitters to the biggest celebratory moments of young lives are explored on Glee, so naturally, any potential cast member needs to be comfortable acting out crushes on-screen.
Last season in The Glee Project, “Romanticality” week tested one contestant’s morality and ultimately made the audience question how he’d even be an actor at all if he didn’t want to fake-kiss anyone. But this year, the theme will be much smoother sailing for the Top 6 left in the competition when they are paired up for a chemistry test music video.
How would you pair up The Glee Project’s Top 6?

After a visit from Darren Criss (we can feel you squeeing through the computer), the remaining contestants tackle “Romanticality” through a music video shoot for Rihanna’s “We Found Love.”
 

'the glee project' takes on 'tenacity'

This video also features special Glee guest star Iqbal Theba, and you can see it in full, before the episode airs, below.
Pairing Aylin and Shanna, Michael and Lily, and Blake and Ali, the contestants are asked to really tap into their sexytime places more than ever before. Aylin should be a natural, since she deems herself the “flirt,” but Blake may be one to watch, too. After all, for a few weeks there it seemed like something was brewing with Nellie, but now he has to turn it “on” for another girl.
Okay, in truth, Celebuzz caught up with Blake, and he brushed aside any rumblings, saying that he loves Nellie as a friend, just as he does all of his co-stars. In fact, he actually already has a girlfriend.
“I just love everybody in the cast so much!” he smiled, completely sincerely.
Down to the Top 6, and they’re still not clawing each other out of the way to win over Ryan Murphy. These kids are either the most well-adjusted we’ve ever seen or too idealistic for their own good!
Watch a sneak peek of Criss as mentor and this week’s intimate music video below!






The Glee Project airs Tuesday nights at 10 PM on Oxygen.

Kim Kardashian: Love for Sean Payton ... No Bush? No Problem./nThere were tons of big stars at Craig's Thursday night -- Viola Davis, Paul Haggis, Nick Jonas -- but Kim Kardashian only stopped to talk to one person ... Saints head coach Sean Payton.  A TMZ staffer inside the restaurant saw the whole thing unfold ... Kim walked into the joint with her good friend Lil' Kim in tow --  "The entire restaurant stopped to look at them. People were in awe. " Kim noticed Payton sitting with 4 other dudes at a table in the middle of the restaurant -- and walked right past other stars (including Haggis) to say what up!  Payton got out of his seat and gave Kim a huge hug -- and congratulated her for a recent accomplishment. She was very appreciative.  Of course, the two go wayyy back ... they first met around 2007 when Kim was dating Reggie Bush who played for Payton's Saints.  Nearly 10 years later ... and with Bush out of the picture for both parties ... they clearly still like each other. Wonder if she's still a Saints fan? /n

NEWS > OMG! ¿Lady Gaga se convertirá en Donatella Versace?A principios de este año se rumoró que Lady Gaga podría tomar el rol de Donatella Versace, sobre todo considerando que ella ya forma parte del universo de Ryan Murphy, y que el director no es tímido al momento de reciclar estrellas de sus diversas producciones. Sin embargo, según las palabras de Murphy a Variety, esto no sucederá."Cuando vas a hacer un show como Versace, es un compromiso de cinco meses, es un show muy grande, lo filmaremos alrededor de todo el mundo. Así que no creo que con su agenda, yo sabía que nunca iba a funcionar. Pero amaría trabajar con ella en algo en el futuro", aseguró Murphy.

 ‘I Can’t Do This Anymore!’ Luann Reveals The Moment She Knew Her Marriage Was Over.../n
Luann de Lesseps is finally telling all about her short-lived marriage to Tom D’Agostino, and RadarOnline.com has all the details!
The Real Housewives of New York star, 52, sat down with Andy Cohen at her Sag Harbor home, and no topic was off-limits during their dramatic interview.
“Was there any one event that led to the filing?” Cohen asked her in a preview clip.
“It was like the weekend before the reunion basically,” the mom-of-two explained. “Tom went out and he called up an old girlfriend and they met up with a group of people and I didn’t know about it. I found out about it the next day in the press. So that for me was like the final straw. I was like, ‘I can’t do this anymore.’”

Then, Cohen pressed about the allegations that she slapped D’Agostino, 50, at a restaurant.
“I didn’t slap him,” she insisted. “What I did was grab his face and it was in the heat of the moment and you know I was hurt about something so I just, you know, I wanted his attention.”
Radar exclusively reported that she participated in a secret photoshoot and interview just last week.

De Lesseps and D’Agostino tied the knot in a lavish New Year’s Eve wedding, but filed for divorce just eight months later. Their relationship was plagued with infidelity, as D’Agostino cheated on de Lesseps just hours before their engagement party in Palm Beach, Fla.
He didn’t clean up his act while they were married, and Radar even caught him at a bar with a mystery blonde just hours after he filed for divorce.
De Lesseps’ interview will air during Watch What Happens Live on Wednesday, Sept. 6 at 11 p.m. EST.

Selma Blair Is Thankful for "Forgiveness" on Birthday After Plane Incident/n
Selma Blair is feeling extra grateful on her 44th birthday after a scary and public ordeal.The Cruel Intentions and Legally Blonde star posted on her Instagram page Thursday a cryptic message referencing "forgiveness" and what appears to be a new photo of her and her son Arthur, 4, holding party plates and a cupcake on a picnic blanket, three days after she was taken off a flight on a stretcher at Los Angeles International Airport, crying and talking about an abusive man. She later apologized for the incident."'And so what should I wish?' And he whispered it in my ear right then. I ask my angel for it to be true every day. And to do the same for others. Thank you @wildersatheart for loving us this birthday," Blair wrote on Instagram, referencing a friend. "Your patience. Your support. We ♥ you. And a sincere thank you to all those who sent me the spirit of loving and forgiveness. It is a new birth year. Thank you."Her Cruel Intentions co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar shared on her Instagram page a sweet birthday post for Blair, along with a photo of the two puckering up at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards, where they won Best Kiss for their onscreen liplock."Smooches on your #birthday," Gellar wrote. "To my friend @therealselmablair , who may be an award winning kisser, but should be an award winning friend and mother!! (And style icon)."

Blair had last posted a pic of her son last week, showing the two on a plane, headed for a trip with his dad and her ex Jason Bleick. The three vacationed in Cancun over Father's Day weekend and the actress' plane outburst took place on their flight back home. Blair had said she "mixed alcohol and medication," which caused her to "black out" and say and do things she deeply regrets."My son was with his Dad asleep with his headphones on, so there is that saving grace," she added. "I take this very seriously, and I apologize to all of the passengers and crew that I disturbed and am thankful to all of the people who helped me in the aftermath. I am a flawed human being who makes mistakes and am filled with shame over this incident. I am truly very sorry."

Lila Says/n
Lila says a lot of things...a lot of tantalizing things. In Ziad Doueiri's adaptation of the sexually charged Gallic novel of the same name, Frenchie Vahina Giocante plays the titular vixen living in her county's poor Arab community. The Lolita teases the boys with her frank talk and short shorts, getting sensitive Mohammed Khouas and his pals especially aroused.

 But East quickly clashes with West when Khouas' coarse friends decide she must be humiliated for ignoring their foul-mouthed come-ons. Khouas is forced to take sides, and the picture's tense conclusion is, unfortunately, no surprise. But it's the performances make this film compelling, especially the subtle, noble vulnerability that Khouas brings to his role. He could've been played for a victim; instead he's a hero. Lila's nice and all, but it's Khouas whom we fall for in this flick.

Bernie's Big Lie EXPOSED: How He Tried To Hide Secret Love Child/n
After Bernie Sanders‘ crushing loss in the Nevada caucus, RadarOnline.com has learned new information that could derail his presidential campaign once and for all. According to documents obtained by Radar, the 74-year-old had a secret love child in the 1960s — and tried to cover it up!
The birth certificate for Levi Sanders, Bernie’s only biological son, shows that the child was born on March 21, 1969. His mother is named as “Susan Sanders” on the document, and her “maiden name” is listed as Susan Cambell Mott. However, there is no indication that the young couple was actually married at the time of their son’s birth — or at any time after that!

So why lie? Sanders and Mott lived together for several years after his split from first wife Deborah.
In 1988, Sanders married his current wife Jane O’Meara Sanders. From there, he inherited her three children from a previous marriage.
Still, Levi has remained out of the spotlight for most of his dad’s campaign. He did, however, reveal to People Magazine in January that Sanders was anything but a father figure.

“When I was a little kid, I started with B. Then it was Ber and then Bern and now it’s Bernard. Or the Bernster. I’ve never called him Bernie. And I never have called him Dad,” he told the magazine. “Even when I was six years old, I thought it was childish. He was a friend, not an authoritarian.”
As Radar previously reported, Sanders was busted for writing sex essays about rape, abuse and kids in 1972.
“He’s a real sicko,” a source said. /n

Princess Margaret’s 18-Year-Old Grandson (the Queen’s Former Page Boy!) Shares Steamy Shirtless Selfie/n
This former page boy is all grown up — and royally shaking up social media with a steamy new photo.
Arthur Chatto, the 18-year-old son of Lady Sarah Chatto (the only daughter of the late Princess Margaret) and grandnephew of Queen Elizabeth II, posted a photo on his Instagram account — which was deleted and restored on Friday — showing himself in nothing but a pair of white Calvin Klein underwear, captioned “#Chatnoleg.”
Much like his cousin Prince Harry, Arthur is on a military career-path. He graduated earlier this year from the Combined Cadet Force at Eton, and most likely will attend Edinburgh University like his older brother Samuel, 21.

The now-hunky Arthur, who is twenty-third in line for the throne, has even inspired a fan account on Instagram that tracks and celebrates his family’s milestones throughout the years.
The steamy mirror selfie reveals a muscle-bound Arthur that may come as a shock to those who remember him as the regally dressed boy who carried the tail of the Queen’s gowns for ceremonies, like during Prince William‘s 2012 knighting at the St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh.

The Story Behind the Viral Photo of Pope Francis and Donald Trump/n

 
Did Pope Francis smile when he met President Trump? It depends on the picture.
All eyes were on the Vatican on Wednesday when Trump, along with members of his family and political inner circle, shared a private audience with the pontiff. Trump had a half hour of the pope’s time for a discussion; they also exchanged gifts and posed for pictures. One image in particular, of a grinning Trump next to a stone-faced Pope Francis, has gone viral.

Trump is wrong pope is not like him. See the difference between Obama v/s trump visit. #donaltrump #pope pic.twitter.com/DzYpYseMCi

The Pope does not look happy to be standing next to Trump, with whom he has publicly feuded in the past. It was noted that Francis has smiled during similar photo-ops with other heads of state, from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to former President Obama. On Wednesday, photos of Obama with a smiley pope in March 2014 made the rounds alongside the Trump image, suggesting Francis was happier to meet Obama than Trump.

But that’s not quite the full picture. Evan Vucci, the Associated Press photographer who made this picture, recalled the rapidly unfolding scene in a phone call on Wednesday. “It happens so fast, like a pool spray at the White House,” he tells TIME.
Vucci was among six photographers who got into the room. The group was first ushered in to photograph Trump and Francis as they sat across from one another at a desk, then back out so the pair could meet. About a half hour later, they returned for more pictures. “We were instructed to stay behind the gift table. It’s packed and everyone is jostling for position,” Vucci says. “They’re shaking hands, [Trump’s] introducing the delegation. Then they do this big group photo.”

The whole group scene was “probably 30 seconds,” he adds. “The mood in the room, it didn’t seem somber. The pope was smiling. They were sort of talking. Nothing seemed unusual to me or out of the ordinary.”
As is often the case with high-profile Trump photo-ops, his online critics will pounce on an image that makes him look aloof, disinterested, uninformed and everything in between. In other cases, images have been shared widely because the shutter clicked at the moment when someone Trump is meeting, say, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, appeared to show hesitation—like during an Oval Office handshake. This is a longterm issue for Trump, with Francis as the latest example.
Choosing to share an image can be incredibly subjective, with a number of factors in play from composition and tonality to political bias and intent. A great image will tell the truth. Many other images from the same scene can often do the opposite.
It is true that a photo editor on Wednesday would have experienced slight difficulty while searching for an image of both Trump and Francis appearing to be delighted in one another’s company. But those images do exist, like this one of Francis smiling as he and Trump exchange gifts.

This is just one image, from one click of the shutter, during a moment when hundreds of pictures were made. For Vucci, a veteran political photojournalist, his work is all about honesty. “I’m trying to be as fair as possible, that’s my job,” he says. “And where people take it, it’s up to them.”
And it’s worth noting that when looking back to Obama’s Vatican visit, there is a larger group shot very similar to Wednesday’s.

Francis isn’t smiling in either shot. You just might not see that image appear in your feed.

"Lisa tells us, NBC called her up today to say sorry for the faux pas -- after it asked Lisa to attend the game as a favor to promote  "Celebrity Apprentice " ... then insulted her with an 11th row seat, while her co-stars Teresa Giudice and Dayana Mendoza sat courtside.Lisa cracked,  "I'm like Rosa Parks! ...

Aww Yeah, Veronica Is Back!/n
Who killed the dean? Are Logan and Veronica over? And will Jason Dohring ever profess his undying love to me?These are the questions this particular die-hard fan wants to know as Veronica Mars returns tonight—woo woo!—for its next batch of so-good episodes. (Though, well, I suppose the third Q is fairly easy to answer, given that Jason's married and all. Hmph.)

I just caught up with Kristen Bell and the boys of Veronica Mars at the CW party, and they were all so adorable and scoopy and silly, I wanted you to see for yourselves. So, I put two clips (one of Kristen Bell and one of Piz and Dick, aka Chris Lowell and Ryan Hansen) in our fun little video player on the main page (the one with the boys plays after Kristen). You can also see the clip of my beloved Ms. Bell on this page.As for the question of LoVe (Logan and Veronica), if you caught the scandalous Veronica scoop in the latest chat, you know there is a rekindling of sorts in the works, but per usual, Logan reveals his bad-boy ways and Veronica might not be able to put up with it. Wahhh!"There is always going to be hope," Veronica mastermind Rob Thomas tells me. "But it is definitely going to be a rocky road for Veronica and Logan the remainder of this season." Double wahhh!Meanwhile, something tells me a little VePi (Veronica and Piz) is in the works this season. (Is it just me, or is it written all over Chris Lowell's face in that video clip?)Post your LoVe/VePi theories below—then check back after tonight's episode to let me know what you thought of it!Veronica Mars airs tonight on the CW. Do not miss it. Seriously. Don't even think about it.

For the Love of Spock! Star Trek's Terry Farrell Engaged to Leonard Nimoy's Son Adam
/n
It’s a match made in deep space!
Adam Nimoy, television director and son of the iconic Leonard Nimoy, is engaged to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine alum Terry Farrell — news that is sure to delight Star Trek fans around the world.
Film critic and fellow Trekkie Scott Mantz first reported the couple’s updated relationship status in a tweet on Friday.
“RT BREAKING NEWS!! How’s THIS for #StarTrek ROYALTY?? TERRY FARRELL & ADAM NIMOY are ENGAGED!! May their love & union LLAP!!,” Mantz tweeted along with a heart and Vulcan salute emoji.
When a Twitter user responded with the question, “Serious? Not fake news? Baby will be 1/16 Vulcan,” the 53-year-old actress confirmed the engagement when she wrote, “Lol nope Not Fake news!”
“It’s for real,” she replied to another fan’s post.
The star of the former 90’s spinoff program has a son from a previous marriage, and Nimoy, 60, has a son and daughter with his ex-wife, E! News reported.

Adam Nimoy made headlines in 2016 when he revealed that he was working on a documentary to memorialize his father Leonard  — whose portrayal of the logical but lovable half-human, half-Vulcan Mr. Spock captured hearts around the world starting in the late 1960s.
“When I originally approached my dad about making the documentary it was just going to be Spock-centric all the way, from beginning to end,” Adam Nimoy told PEOPLE in July of 2016. “It was really supposed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Star Trek coming up in September.”
The father-son duo began work on what would become For the Love of Spock in Sept. 2014, but just a few months later Leonard passed away on February 27, 2015 at the age of 83 after a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
“After my dad died there was such an outpouring of emotion,” he says. “Not only for Spock but the loss of Leonard Nimoy the artist and renaissance man. It became clear when I decided to continue on with the project that it had to include my dad’s life as well.”
A month after creating  a Kickstarter to raise funds for the documentary the project met and surpassed its $600,000 goal by more than $60,000, Variety reported.

Michigan Republicans Are DESPERATE To Have Kid Rock Run For Senate!/n

After seeing their success with one entertainer turned politician in Donald Trump, Republicans in Michigan are getting REALLY serious about potentially repeating the feat with Kid Rock.
The GOP wants Kid Rock (real name Robert Ritchie) to run for the Senate seat next year against Democrat incumbent Debbie Stabenow, and they aren't even really holding back in their hopes anymore — they have literally no one else to run but celebrities!
Related: 15 Stars Who Have Dipped Their Toes In Politics!
While Republicans stlll believe that his bid is somewhat unlikely even after recent events indicating otherwise, they are nevertheless encouraged that literally everyone knows who Kid Rock is — and that could go a long way for a victory, says Robert Steele, the Republican national committeeman from Michigan: 

"People know him — he's an extremely strong brand in Michigan. He's fought for Detroit, he's fought hard for kids who want to go to his concerts, he's fought hard for the working class, he's a southeast Michigan booster through and through. If he were in the race, I think he would win. But I doubt we'll see him in the race."

And while Ritchie would likely steamroll right through the Republican primary, he might run into more trouble in the general election, when he's set to face off with the very popular Stabenow.
Nevertheless, leading GOPers like Steven Law, a super PAC leader in the state, point to polls suggesting they believe Kid Rock could nevertheless win: 

"We'd be actually very interested in his candidacy. There was a poll that came out that showed him 8 points behind the incumbent, Debbie Stabenow. That's not a bad place to start out."

Is this going to be the Republicans' new strategy — recruit celebs to run?! Who's next — Ted Nugent?! The Rock?!?!

Veronica Mars Creator Says Show Could Return as Limited Series/n

Fellow Veronica Mars fans, we may yet return to the sordid city of Neptune one day.  
Rob Thomas, creator of the series, says he could see Kristen Bell returning as everyone’s favorite smartmouthed detective possibly for another movie or maybe even a limited series at some point, though he qualified that by saying that such talk was only preliminary.  
“Kristen’s game. I’m certainly game,” Thomas said in an interview with TVLine.   
“We have nothing in the works. Kristen and I have talked about possibly doing a second movie or taking it out as a short run series. A Veronica Mars True Detective is really appealing to us.”  

PEOPLE’s Most Beautiful: Kristen Bell
Thomas is currently showrunner on the Veronica Mars-esque CW series iZombie, which was picked up for a second season, and Bell currently stars on House of Lies, whose fifth season kicks off in 2016.  
In June 2014, Bell told PEOPLE that she’d be happy to bring back her famous character in whatever fashion she could. “I would be down for anything,” she said. “I’m that kind of a girl. You can quote me on that.”

Teen Mom 2 star Leah Messer, the mother of 5-year-old twins Ali and Aleeah and 2-year-old Adalynn, is expecting a new baby in her family, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
But fortunately for the troubled 23-year-old, who also helps care for boyfriend T.R. Dues‘ two young sons, it’s her sister who will be making the big delivery.
Messer’s little sister Victoria Jones, 21, announced her pregnancy on Facebook late last week.

“Looks like I’m gonna be a Mommy!” she posted. “I’ve waited so long for this, I’m glad I get to share this with my husband.”

Jones, who married husband Brian in April, also posted a photo of her positive pregnancy test and revealed her unborn child’s name options.
“Adrianna Jean Jones or Joshua Eugene Jones,” she gushed.

But mom-of-three Messer thought her sis, who said she just found out she was pregnant the day prior, was jumping the gun.
“Stop it you have plenty of time to name this kid,” the reality star wrote.
“HUSH,” the girls’ mother, Dawn Spears, responded.

Jones makes frequent cameos on Teen Mom 2, especially in recent episodes as Messer receives treatment in an out-of-state rehab.
In real time, the MTV queen completed treatment for what she claims was an anxiety and depression issue (but what sources tell Radar was a prescription painkiller problem), and is now living with her daughters and boyfriend Dues, 32, in a new Charleston, West Virginia, home. /n
LOOK GREAT, FEEL GREAT With Nora Tobin/n
Summer’s right around the corner! And as things heat up, there’s no better way to have fun, stay healthy and keep cool than with water-inspired workouts, which have both physical and mental benefits. These water workouts will improve performance, burn fat, build lean muscle, increase energy and give you the summer bod that you’ve always wanted!

THE EXPERT NORA TOBIN
Nutrition and performance enhancement specialist, health and fitness consultant for Four Seasons hotels, contributing editor to Shape.
 
20 MINUTES TO MAJOR TRANSFORMATIONS — HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING (HIIT)
Just like on land, the best water workouts use HIIT, which torches fat, improves power output, builds lean muscle and strengthens the cardiovascular system. This type of training is designed to be done in short bursts, exercising at a fast pace for 20 seconds followed by a moderate pace for 10 seconds, for a period of 20 minutes. The short bursts help the body burn calories well after the workout is over.

BUTTERFLY KICKS
Move on to your stomach, holding a kickboard out in front of you. Bring legs together and perform a butterfly kick (bend knees and move the legs like one big flipper). Kick as hard as possible for two lengths in the pool. Follow that up with two lengths of steady state kicking. Repeat the movement, kicking as fast as possible for two lengths, followed by two lengths at moderate pace. Continue with this pattern for 10 minutes.
SIDE KICKS
Move on to your side, holding a kickboard out in front of you. Start to scissor-kick your legs as hard as possible for two lengths in the pool. Follow that up with two lengths of steady state kicking. Continue with this pattern for 10 minutes.
SWIMMING DRILLS
Jump into a pool or ocean and swim at a moderate pace for five to 10 minutes to warm up. Then perform a 50-yard sprint (two lengths in a pool or about one minute in the ocean). Follow up the sprint with a two-minute slow drill, which helps with technique. Repeat the series 10 times.
 

STAND-UP PADDLE INTERVALS
Perform 30 seconds of paddling as fast as possible, followed by one minute at a moderate pace. Repeat 10 times.

HYDRATION TIPS: THE INSIDE SCOOP
No matter your fitness goals, proper hydration is a key component. As a Propel ambassador, I know that in order to maximize fitness performance, especially during outdoor activities in the summer heat, you need to drink water that contains electrolytes, which help replace what you lose in sweat. My go-to is Propel Electrolyte Water. It contains no sugar, has zero calories and keeps me going with nine fun flavors! Propel Electrolyte Water is designed for passionate exercisers with busy, active lifestyles who want a water that is formulated for fitness and supports hydration. Grab Propel Electrolyte Water to stay hydrated this summer!

Robert Pattinson never meant any harm. The actor sparked concern over an anecdote shared during a recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he claimed the director of Good Time urged Pattinson to perform a sex act on a dog while filming. He refused, and a prosthetic penis was created for the scene. Robert has since clarified his intention in sharing the story, which he says was meant to be comedic. "The story I told on Jimmy Kimmel last night seems to have spiraled out of control," he tells E! News in a statement. "What didn't come across is that this was supposed to be a joke. No one at all expected or assumed that anything like that would happen on the Good Time set."He continued, "We are all huge animal lovers and would obviously never do anything to harm an animal."

The English-born celeb went on to defend the cast and crew of the upcoming crime drama. "Everyone involved in Good Time are amazing professionals and have come together to make a movie that I'm extremely proud of," Pattinson concluded. "I feel embarrassed that in the moment, I was trying to make Jimmy laugh, only to create confusion and a false impression."Animal rights organization PETA offered its support to Pattinson and said they were launching an investigation to verify the incident's legality. "PETA depends on actors and crew members to come forward when they see mistreatment, whether it involves a dog who is being forced into churning water on the set of A Dog's Purposeor an A-list actor who is being asked to molest his canine co-star,"  Vice President Lisa Lange said in a statement to E! News. "Robert Pattinson is our kind of guy (and everyone's who has a heart) for refusing to masturbate a dog—which is like child molestation—and for talking about it so that the public can see that once again animal trainers' top priority is money and animals' interests and well-being are often ignored."

Good Time is in theaters Aug. 11.

Below Deck Mediterranean's Bobby Giancola and Hannah Ferrier on How to Get Your Best Summer Style
/n
Virginia Sherwood/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty (2)
Bravo’s Below Deck Mediterranean set sail on season 2 and just five episodes in there have already been massive fights below deck and detrimental anchor trouble that’s left the boat stranded at sea. But if anyone knows how to keep it together under pressure, it’s the cool and collected cast. PeopleStyle caught up with deckhand Bobby Giancola and chief stew Hannah Ferrier to talk about summer style, the craziest things they’ve seen on charter and of course, the drama that’s about to go down this season.
Whether or not you plan to charter a million dollar yacht any time soon, you can still summer in style thanks to these genius tips from the crew. If your plans include cruising the Caribbean or just hanging at a backyard barbecue, Ferrier suggests always having three things handy: a bikini, sunglasses and a caftan.
“I think some [yacht guests] are crazy to get fully dressed, do full makeup, go almost black tie for dinner,” Ferrier tells PeopleStyle. “I’m like, ‘You’re on a yacht. Go for a sunset swim and then have a cocktail, throw a caftan over your bikini and enjoy dinner.’ Maybe if you have a birthday or something to celebrate, for sure get dressed up one night. But I feel like a lot come on and spend half their time doing their makeup and hair. Enjoy yourself, just be chill.”
And before you embark on a summer getaway, never forget to pack the essentials. They say the items guests most frequently forget are cell phone chargers, converters, sunscreen and sea sickness medicine.
“A common thing is not really forgetting to bring sea sickness medicine, but forgetting to take it before they get on the boat,” says Giancola. “If you’re already feeling sea sick, then it’s too late.”

Being outside all day, every day means they know which sun-protecting items last the long haul because they put them to the test, literally. “I did a sunscreen test, with two different kinds on each arm,” says Giancola. “With one application of Neutrogena you’re good for hours.”
As for Ferrier, she uses Clarins for her body, Creme de la Mer for her face and swears by polarized Ray Bans wayfarers, but mixes it up with a Céline pair throughout the season as well.
Giancola wears polarized Oakley sunglasses, although admits he’ll still “find a way to break a pair even if they’re indestructible.”
FROM PEN: Amandla Stenberg’s Best Beauty Lesson Is One We All Need to Follow

Out of the sea of extravagant demands asked by guests, Ferrier dishes on some of the most shocking requests she’s had to deliver. “I’ve had to fly in masseuse, nail people, facialists. I’ve worked on a yacht where we had a beauty person on board 24/7, it was a 10-day charter and I think she worked an hour in the 10 days. So that’s kind of crazy.”
“I had this one charter guest that was obsessed with Chanel,” Ferrier says. “He chartered the boat for a month and in his suitcase he had 28 Chanel handbags. The day that he came on, he gave me Chanel diamond earrings to say thanks in advance. And then he gave me a Chanel bracelet about a week later and some vintage Chanel earrings about a week after that.”
What’s even more shocking than surprise Chanel gifts is some of the drama already going down between the crew. Giancola and Ferrier have already feuded when Giancola accused her of tarnishing his reputation to a potential love-interest on board. And while the dust seems to have settled on that argument, Giancola says things are only going to heat up below deck.
“It’s juicy! There’s a lot of flirting going on and confusion on who does who like,” Giancola says. “And then there’s times where you don’t want to step on anyone else’s toes, but then you’re getting mixed feelings. Then there are past relationships that affect judgement of others. You’ll see it’s crazy! Things come out of left field. There were things that still surprise me and I lived it!”
Watch Below Deck Mediterranean Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.

UPDATE: Earlier today, Brigid Sweetman, the mother of Jim Carrey's late Irish girlfriend Cathriona White, and Mark Burton, White's estranged ex-husband, have filed a formal amended, consolidated complaint against the actor for the wrongful death of his ex-girlfriend.In documents obtained by E! News, Sweetman's second amended complaint against the 55-year-old actor calls for Burton and Sweetman's separate lawsuits to be combined into one joint wrongful death lawsuit. White's mother and her estranged husband are listed as co-petitioners against the star.Michael Avenatti, attorney for Sweetman and Burton, told E! News: "We look forward to Mr. Carrey being required to explain to a Los Angeles jury why he gave Ms. White three STD's, lied to her about it, demeaned her and then ultimately provided her with the drugs she used to take her own life."Avenatti says the legal team anticipates the trial, which is slated for April 26, 2018, lasting 20 days.The lawyer said that the next big event in the Truman Show actor's case will be his deposition in August. His video-taped deposition will take place in Los Angeles attorney's office.—————Jim Carrey has dropped his request for the mother of his late ex-girlfriend to pay $372,000 in the wrongful death case. In court documents obtained by E! News, the actor withdrew his motion with prejudice. We've also learned that the parties are not working on a settlement. In fact, the case is expected to go to trial in April 2018 with Jim possibly testifying.—————Jim Carrey is firing back at allegations made in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against him by the mother of Cathriona White, his late Irish girlfriend.The hair and makeup artist, who dated the actor on and off since 2012, committed suicide last year by overdosing on prescription medications his lawyer says she had stolen from him.In October, White's mother Brigid Sweetman sued Carrey, blaming him for her daughter's death. She claimed he "knowingly" gave her "three sexually transmitted diseases" "without warning her," then "lying to her about it, dumping her out of concern for saving his own public image, calling her a 'whore' and shaming her, and then using his high-priced Hollywood lawyers and 'fixers' to intimidate and threaten her in an effort to silence her."This week, Carrey filed papers in response to Sweetman's lawsuit, seeking to strike "numerous irrelevant, false and improper" allegations she had made.

Carrey calls Sweetman's lawsuit a "shameful shakedown for money" and accuses her of seeking to "profit from the suicide-death of her long-estranged daughter" who "chose to end her own life in 2015 on the third anniversary of her beloved father's death.""The false, irrelevant and improper allegations were inserted for the sole purpose of harassing, embarrassing and humiliating Carrey in an effort to shame him into an unmerited settlement and should be stricken in their entirety," Carrey's filing states.



JosiahW/AKM-GSI

The documents state Carrey met White at a Guns N' Roses concert in 2012 and then spent "substantial time together as a couple at his house in Los Angeles," broke up in mid-2013 "amid White's unfounded accusations that he gave her STDs, which Carrey denied." They say in November 2014, White "reached out to Carrey to rekindle their relationship, apologizing to Carrey for her prior accusations" and that the two "remained a loving couple" until her death.White was found dead in her Los Angeles home on Sept. 28, 2016. According to a coroner's report included in Carrey's filing, she died of suicide by overdosing on Propranolol, used to treat hypertension, chest pain or migraines, Zolpidem, used to treat insomnia, and the painkillers Oxycodone and Oxymorphone. 

In his filing, Carrey says he did not illegally obtain or provide White with the drugs that killed her, as Sweetman claims."Indeed, no facts whatsoever are alleged as to how Carrey purportedly furnished drugs to White and the Complaint merely parrots the conclusory language of the Drug Dealer Liability Act, alleging no facts at all," the filing states."White loved Carrey, viewed him (and not Sweetman) as her family; and White was not upset with him at the time she took her own life by overdosing on prescription medication," the filing says, adding that White had "sought out and stole Carrey's prescription medication from his home without his knowledge." 



JosiahW/AKM-GSI

The lawsuit said White left two suicide notes to Carrey, in which she told him she loved him, asked him to "forgive" her and called him her "family." White also asked the actor to divide her possessions and make her funeral arrangements.Carrey had attended her burial in her native Ireland, even helping carry her coffin. Her mother claims the actor had offered to pay for the funeral expenses and "then reneged."Carrey's attorney wants the court to strike that claim as well, as well as another claim she made, that the actor owns a private jet, which he does not. He dubbed both allegations "irrelevant" and "improper." 

White's estranged husband, Mark Burton, had also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey in September, also claiming the actor had illegally obtained the medications White had overdosed on and had provided them to her and also accusing him of giving White STDs."I will not tolerate this heartless attempt to exploit me or the woman I loved," the actor had said in response to the lawsuit. "Cat's troubles were born long before I met her and sadly her tragic end was beyond anyone's control. I really hope that some day soon people will stop trying to profit from this and let her rest in peace."Originally published December 21, 2016 at 12:08 p.m. PST

Bridezilla Holds ‘Auction’ For Friends To Bid To Be Bridesmaids In Her Wedding! Seriously!/n

One bride is showing what it really means to be a bridezilla!
This week, a Reddit user posted to the site asking for advice on what to do about her 22-year-old sister's wedding. According to her, the bride is holding an actual "auction" for her friends to bid on spots to be in her bridal party!
Including her sister!
Related: Brides Are Stressed Out After Popular Dress Chain Abruptly Closes
The 33-year-old wrote: 
"My sister was always very spoiled by our parents since she's the youngest of four kids and my mom had thought she wouldn't be able to have any more kids. Don't get me wrong, she can be very sweet and caring too, but she's just a very immature high maintenance person. Basically she got engaged a couple of months ago and will be getting married at the end of August. Anyway she still hasn't chosen her bridesmaids. Instead, she has sent out dozens of…invitations, to various girls. It's an invite to attend and participate in a ‘bidding auction' on the six spots in her bridal party. Whichever six of all these chicks bid the most will be the bridesmaids. There's also an auction for being her maid of honor. My sister and her fiancé are using the money to fund the wedding and honeymoon."
Insanity!! As if the cost of being a bridesmaid isn't enough!
Commenters have been going crazy over the auction, advising the sister not to go to the event. Or if she does go, she should bid no more than one dollar and get video… LOLz!
The unnamed poor soul further explained in the comments:
"She just has a really big social circle from parties and I guess she invited everyone she even vaguely knows… I just find this really awkward and tacky. She's basically having people pay to be in her wedding… I told my sister they weren't lacking for funds because it's obvious and she just said, ‘Well, if they'll already be bidding, we figure we should put their money towards a great event for everyone' as though this is an act of service she's doing for them. It's totally nonsensical."
Additionally, she says her mom is taking the bride's side in all this:
"Now my sister is throwing a tantrum that I haven't RSVPed to the ‘auction,' and got our mom on her side too. My mom says I will ‘look bad if I don't put in a bid when it's my own sister' and called me selfish."
The fuck??
As entertaining as the thread is (HERE), the commenters all seem to agree this sounds like a messed up situation!
Would U ever bid in an auction to be a bridesmaid in a wedding?

Charlottesville Car Attack Victims Sue James Alex Fields and Rally Organizers for $3 Million/nJames Alex Fields Jr.'s victims are striking back with a huge lawsuit ... and they're going after more white nationalists they believe were responsible for the Charlottesville carnage. Tadrint and Micah Washington have filed suit against Fields, as well as many organizers of the alt-right rally in Charlottesville Saturday -- including David Duke, Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler. According to the docs ... the Washingtons were in the car into which Fields slammed, causing a violent chain reaction that resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, injuring 19 others. Tadrint and Micah claim they were not counterprotesters or involved in any events related to the rally, but were simply trying to drive home and were waiting for pedestrians when Fields plowed into them. According to the docs ... they were left with serious injuries and a vehicle covered in blood. The suit also names several other white nationalist organizations that were present Saturday. The 2 are suing for $3 million for assault and battery, civil conspiracy and negligence.  Fields has been charged with second-degree murder and malicious wounding for the attack. We reached out to rally organizers named in the suit ... no word back so far./n

Justice for Barb!

Everyone loved Stranger Things for different reasons: The heaping portions of ‘80s nostalgia, a fresh new take on the teenage horror flick, and we can’t forget young Millie Bobby Brown’s mesmerizing performance as Eleven. But you’d be lying if you said the nerdy teen Barb Holland (played by Shannon Purser) didn’t somehow manage to find her way into your heart. Now, Purser is making the rounds among the industry’s top casting directors and is already lining up new roles.
For the 19-year-old actress from Atlanta, Stranger Things was her first acting role but it certainly won’t be her last. According to The Hollywood Reporter, she has met with casting directors with ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Sony, Warner Bros., TBS/TNT and more.

“It’s been a whirlwind of an experience to have such a high level of excitement surrounding Shannon, and the types of meetings and projects coming her way. It’s a true testament to the layers and nuance she was able to build into the character to help it resonate with the audience the way it has, and of course, a little luck.”

Take That, Jen! Ben Hits Back After Ex Garner's Bitter 'Vanity Fair' Tell-All/n
Ben Affleck has remained mum since his estranged wife’s scathing interview about their messy divorce— until now.
In a sit-down with the New York Times, the Batman actor finally addressed Jen Garner‘s Vanity Fair tell-all, in which she said he made a “bad judgment” and confirmed rumors he had an affair with the children’s young nanny.
“She felt like she wanted to discuss it and get it out there and get it over with so she could say, ‘Look, I already talked about it— I don’t want to do it again,” the father of three, 43, explained.

“It’s fine, she’s allowed to talk about it.”
In the former couple’s quest to maintain a state of normalcy for their kids, Garner, 43, along with Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7, and Samuel, 4, will soon vacation with Affleck in Europe, he told the reporter.
“Jen’s great. She’s a great person,” he insisted. “I just saw her this morning.”

He did admit, however, that he was going through a “particularly hard time.”
Despite insisting he’s on “good terms” with his ex, Affleck was secretly “shocked” and “irritated” when he first read her interview, sources told Radar earlier this month.
As Radar reported, the Vanity Fair tell-all has also started a feud between Garner and Affleck’s family.
Christine Boldt is “really devastated,” a source said. “She worried that Jen’s getting caught up in the fame game again and going for headlines by throwing Ben under the bus.” /n

Arrest Reports Detail Max Kennedy’s Allegedly ‘Irate’ Behavior During House Party in Hyannis Port/n
Arrest reports obtained by PEOPLE allege that Matthew “Max” Kennedy — one of Robert F. Kennedy’s 11 children — “yelled” at police “incoherently” before throwing himself against a wall and smashing a cabinet full of “glass valuables” on Sunday morning when police officers tried entering the home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where he was attending a rowdy party.
Kennedy, 52, and his daughter, 22-year-old Caroline R. Kennedy, were both arrested and charged with disorderly conduct stemming from the incident.
Max Kennedy has pleaded not guilty to the charge. His daughter has not yet appeared before a judge to enter a plea.
PEOPLE’s attempts to reach both directly have been unsuccessful. Max’s attorney has not returned repeated messages for comment and court officials say Caroline has not retained a lawyer.
According to the arrest reports, Barnstable, Massachusetts, police were dispatched to the home — on the 100 block of Irving Avenue, not far from the historic Kennedy family compound — about 1:15 a.m. Sunday by a neighbor complaining about the noise.
As officers approached the house, they could see people inside with microphones, singing to loud music, the reports state. There were also empty beer cans strewn all across the front lawn, and police learned that there had been “several complaints about the noise … throughout the evening,” including incidents of people lighting fireworks from a nearby pier, according to the reports.
Officers knocked at the door, and the music immediately lowered. A woman answered and was talking to police when Max Kennedy walked up and “immediately became angry with me,” the arresting officer wrote in the reports obtained by PEOPLE.
Not long after, the music began to blare again and the officers informed the elder Kennedy that he was violating noise restrictions. The arrest report alleges he refused to identify himself and, when asked for his license, “became irate.”
Officers noted he had “glassy” and “blood shot eyes” and claim he was “sweating profusely.”
Max allegedly “yelled” at the officers, telling them not to enter the home, according to the reports. As police approached the door, he “yelled and screamed” and told them to leave, they claim. The arrest report further alleges he was making “erratic movements.”

An officer went to enter the home “and Kennedy began screaming incoherently and throwing himself against the wall,” the reports states. He allegedly grabbed a cabinet and toppled it in anger.
When police went to detain him, “he pulled away by stiffening his arms,” according to the report. He allegedly refused instructions from police to relax his arms and continued resisting arrest.
The arresting officer said in his report that while he was detaining Max, people in the room said, “You don’t know who you’re messing with” and informed the policeman that “he was a district attorney.”
Max was led outside in handcuffs and a large crowd of partygoers began to amass. Back-up was summoned just as Caroline allegedly ran towards the officer’s cruiser, where she allegedly tried opening the door, according to the reports.
An officer managed to stop her, which angered the crowd. In his report, the officer said he was surrounded by an “angry mob” that was filming the entire ordeal with their smart phones.
Several officers responded and helped disperse the group.
Father and daughter were also charged with violating a local anti-noise ordinance. Authorities have said no other arrests were made at the party.
Max and Caroline Kennedy were released on their own recognizance after being taken into custody early Sunday.

famous faces such as Kerry Washington and Kate Middleton.  The mag's best dressed list featured two VF International Best-Dressed Challenge winners, Hallie Swanson and Darren Henault, who posted photos of their chic ensembles via social.../n
Vanity Fair has placed profiles of two everyday citizens on their annual best dressed list alongside famous faces such as Kerry Washington and Kate Middleton. The mag's best dressed list featured two VF International Best-Dressed Challenge winners, Hallie Swanson and Darren Henault, who posted photos of their chic ensembles via social media. Swanson, a fashion blogger based in Los Angeles, is fond of "different styles and patterns of jeans" and her all-time favorite accessory, a Chanel 2.55 bag. The blogger credits Australian model Miranda Kerr as one of her style inspirations.

Henault, an interior designer who lives in New York City, has a mix of influences, telling the mag that "Bill Blass with a touch of Pee-Wee Herman and the Mad Hatter thrown in," are his primary style icons. He also boasts a fur hat collection, naming "the mink top hat I had made in Florence" as his favorite item of clothing.Vanity Fair also revealed an International Best-Dressed Challenge winner for June: Kamau Hosten, a student at Florida International University in Miami, was named the best dressed for the month, citing his "proper, elegant and simple" style for the win.

Hosten is inspired most by the men of a golden era: "My personal style represents a sort of return to the elegance and the etiquette that I admire from a lot of the black-and-white movies that I grew up watching. The Carey Grants and Humphrey Bogarts that I would watch," he said. "In real life you had your dapper people, like Malcolm X, like JFK. And these are the guys that I remember looking up to always, saying how sharp they were—how elegant, how poised and polished they were. I feel that my style represents a nod to that era."But Hosten also acknowledges some modern facets to his style, admitting, "I try to inject a little bit of color here and there, where I can."Want to join the ranks of Hallie, Darren and Kamau? Submit photos of yourself via Twitter, Instagram or Trendabl using the hashtag #vfbestdressed. Or go to VF.com and submit your picture directly on the site. The magazine's readers will vote for their favorite looks, and VF's editors will keep track of the votes to name a weekly winner. There's no limit to the number of submitted snapshots!

Child Porn Convict Spits Blood At Victim During Heated Court Hearing/n
The sentencing for a New York resident convicted of child porn and other sex-related crimes involving two New Jersey teens was abruptly paused on Monday after he bit the inside of his mouth and spit blood at one of the victims.
Clifford Wares was tackled and restrained following the incident. He was later sentenced to life in prison, after Judge Esther Salas called his crimes “heinous and deplorable.”
PHOTOS; Secret Children, Rehab & Rape Claims: What To Expect On The New Season of ‘Teen Mom OG’
The 43-year-old was charged last month for child pornography production and interstate travel to engage in illicit sexual conduct, according to reports.
Wares was also found guilty of obstruction of justice after it was discovered that he had sent threatening letters to his victims and their families anonymously.
Prosecutors claim Wares met both of the teenage girls, then 14 and 13, online in 2011.
The 14-year-old regularly had sexually explicit communications with Wares before meeting him in person in Passaic County, when he picked her up and the pair engaged in sexual acts in a nearby park. When she refused to meet him again, Wares threatened to ruin her reputation.

Prosecutors say he later tried to force her to have sex with a dog that he gave her, and when she refused he went “ballistic.”
Meanwhile, Wares’ communication with the 13-year-old began when he posed as a child she knew on Facebook, convincing her to send him explicit photos and videos of herself.
When she resisted his requests, Wares threatened to show the lewd media to her parents and friends.
Police captured Wares in 2012 in a park near his home. When they arrested him, Wares had handcuffs, duct tape, a knife and a handwritten list of names of children acquainted with his victims in his possession. /n
Bill Cosby's Sexual Assault Retrial Set to Begin Five Months After Jury Deadlocked After a mistrial was declared, District Attorney Kevin Steele called Andrea "courageous" for coming forward and staying strong during the trial.../n
Bill Cosby will face another day in court when his sexual assault retrial begins this fall.A judge announced today that the comedian and actor will go on trial again beginning November 6.That date will mark nearly five months since a judge declared his sexual assault trial a mistrial. After 52 hours of deliberations, the jury was deadlocked and unable to reach a verdict."You've worked so hard," the judge told the panel of seven men and five women. "I'm compelled to declare a mistrial. It is neither a vindication or a victory. This was the justice system."The comedian had been charged with three counts of felony aggravated indecent assault stemming from a 2004 incident involving Andrea Constand at his home in Pennsylvania. Bill has maintained his innocence throughout the trial.

After a mistrial was declared, District Attorney Kevin Steele called Andrea "courageous" for coming forward and staying strong during the trial."She is a positive person and has kept all of us going while waiting for the jury to come back," he told reporters. "She will continue to cooperate with us and I look forward to her getting a verdict in this case."In comparison, Bill's wife Camille Cosby slammed the prosecution and judge after the case ended in a mistrial.

"How do I describe the district attorney? Heinously and exploitively ambitious," she said in a statement. "How do I describe the judge? Overtly and arrogantly collaborating with the district attorney. How do I describe the counsels for the accusers? Totally unethical."Camille continued, "Historically, people have challenged injustices. I am grateful to any of the jurors who tenaciously fought to review the evidence; which is the rightful way to make a sound decision...ultimately, that is a manifestation of justice, based on facts, not lies."One jury member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told ABC News that 10 of the 12 jurors thought Bill was guilty on the first and third felony count; one juror thought he was guilty on the second count.

Despite winning two Grammys in 2013, he explained that he wants to make a statement against the awards show, which he believe is “not representing” all artists equally.
“That institution certainly has nostalgic importance,” he told The New York Times in his first (real) interview in three years. “It just doesn’t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.”

Judge Says Johnny Depp's Ridiculously Outrageous Spending Habits Are Not Relevant To His Fraud Case!/n

Johnny Depp's blockbuster-sized spending habits have NOTHING to do with his legal drama!
At least, that's what a judge ruled in a preliminary hearing on Monday amid the actor's heated court battle against his former business managers.
While Depp claims his ex-managers put him in a dire financial situation, The Management Group says they repeatedly warned the Pirates of the Caribbean star his over-the-top lifestyle was causing him to spend well over his means.
After Depp sued TMG for allegedly collecting millions in fees without his consent back in January, TMG filed a cross complaint claiming that Depp's financial woes came from spending $2 million a month on expensive wine and real estate.
Related: Depp's Management Team Confirms He DID Beat Amber Heard
But that little detail didn't matter to L.A. County Superior Court Judge Teresa Beaudet, who ruled that Depp's spending habits play no part in the case that alleges the actor's ex-team mismanaged his money — however, the promissory fraud case against the actor will continue.
TMG had asked the court for a declaration that "Depp caused his own financial waste by acting directly contrary to TMG's repeated advice over the last 17 years and the advice of numerous of Depp's other advisors."
But Beaudet rejected the money manager's declaration for "placing culpability for Depp's financial woes on him, and freeing TMG of any past wrongdoing" without proper evidence. She wrote: 
"The pages of allegations of Depp's allegedly outrageous spending clearly have no relevance to the 5% commission allegedly owed TMG from the Pirates of the Caribbean payout, or to the final work done by TMG on transitioning their files to Depp's new representatives. They would seem more relevant to the allegations of breach of oral contract related to the credit card debts, except that TMG does not specifically allege which exact expenditures by Depp were spent on which card, leading to that debt owed. Without specifics, the Court cannot find they are relevant to any cause of action in the FACC."
Interestingly enough, both Depp's team and TMG told The Hollywood Reporter they had the upper-hand following the hearing. The actor's attorney Benjamin Chew said:
"Today the court threw out a meritless cause of action TMG never should have asserted. The fact that they had to change their theory on the fly is a sign of their desperation to distract from the real issues in the case. The court also granted Mr. Depp's motion to strike from the cross complaint a mountain of gratuitous smears about him. This was a good day for Johnny Depp."
But since Beaudet granted The Management Group a second chance to reframe their declaration, the money managers are feeling just as good. The team said in a statement:
"Today's ruling was a clear victory for The Management Group because the Court ruled in favor of our fraud claim. We intend to file an amended cross complaint for declaratory relief. All of the issues regarding Depp's extravagant spending continue to be fully included in the case."
Oof. We'll see how long both sides feel good about this increasingly complicated legal battle.

Leslie Van Houten's Plea for Freedom, 'Mature' and Out of Charles Manson's Control/nLeslie Van Houten deserves parole from her life sentence because she was too immature to understand her savage actions in the Manson family killing spree ... according to new legal docs. Leslie’s lawyer, Richard Pfeiffer, submitted a 13-page report to convince the parole board to release her. The report includes testimony from psychologist Laurence Steinberg ... who says then 19-year-old Leslie’s immaturity prevented her from exercising self-restraint, controlling her impulses and weighing consequences. Van Houten was convicted for the stabbing murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Steinberg adds as Van Houten grew up ... her brain matured and she escaped Charles Manson’s brainwashing. He believes her exemplary prison record proves she has matured and “strongly suggests” she won’t commit further criminal acts. Of course, Van Houten got shot down for parole last year when Governor Jerry Brown nixed the idea. The report will be presented at her next parole hearing, later this year. Leslie, now 67, was the youngest person ever sentenced to death in California. That was later commuted to life with parole./n
Nora Ephron, Sleepless in Seattle Director, Dead at 71 If you like romantic-comedies, and you like them witty, chances are you have loved Nora Ephron. The writer of When Harry Met Sally..., and filmmaker of Sleepless in Seattle, You've .../n
If you like romantic-comedies, and you like them witty, chances are you have loved Nora Ephron.The writer of When Harry Met Sally..., and filmmaker of Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, and the Julia Child valentine, Julie & Julia, died today of leukemia. She was 71.

Word of Ephron's illness leaked today, New York reported on its website, when columnist Liz Smith published an online tribute to the writer-director.A former journalist herself, Ephron made her first substantial mark in Hollywood as the writer of the 1983 biopic, Silkwood, for which she earned the first of her three career Oscar nominations.Silkwood starred Meryl Streep, who would go onto star in two more Ephron-penned films, 2009's Julie & Julia, and 1986's Heartburn, based on the Ephron novel, which itself was based on Ephron's failed marriage to Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein.

Ephron moved into household-name territory with the 1989 Rob Reiner-director When Harry Met Sally... Ephron took credit for the hit's central thesis—can a man and woman be just friends?—but not for its most famous line. (Billy Crystal was said to have dreamed up the retort to Meg Ryan's faked deli orgasm: "I'll have what she's having.")Ephron made her directing debut in the 1992 stage comedy, This Is My Life, starring The Simpson's Julie Kavner.Her track record as a director was hit (John Travolta's Michael, the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan favorite You've Got Mail, Julie & Julia) and miss (most notably, her 2005 attempt to recast Bewitched as a big-screen romantic-comedy for Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell).

Julie & Julia, for which Streep earned an Oscar nomination, was Ephron's last film.Ephron never published a memoir, so to speak, but she wrote about her life often, including in the two latter-day essay collections I Feel Bad About My Neck and I Remember Nothing."Some people just get unbelievably lucky and they're like Kitty Hart and they live to be 94 years old and still performing at Carnegie Hall. And still with great legs," Ephron told Salon.com in a 2010 interview, as she summed up how aging was a matter of good luck and bad.   The daughter of screenwriters Henry Ephron and Phoebe Ephron, Ephron was born May 19, 1941, in New York City. Her survivors include her husband, writer Nicholas Pileggi (Goodfellas and Casino, both based on his books), and sisters Delia Ephron and Amy Ephron, both of whom are also writers.

Twitter User Suspended For Sexually Harassing Tony The Tiger Gets People Talking About What Should REALLY Be Policed On Social Media!/n

I thought 'I'd fuck that tiger' would be a funny joke and tweeted it without giving it a second thought. Just the idea of sexualizing this corporate cereal mascot struck me as a suitably bizarre thing to share with the sort of people who like to interact with promoted tweets from multi-billion-dollar food processing conglomerates."
OK, all good. But never forget how difficult parody is on the Internet.
While Boivin thought it would be obvious what he wrote was facetious, there actually are people who sexualize Tony the Tiger. The account has been blocking furries who tweet at it for quite some time.
Don't believe us? We told you about it LAST YEAR!

Naturally, people who heard about this and found it hilarious started trolling the account, so it's only gotten worse. Crazy stuff.
So it seems @realtonytiger is now sending tweets directly to Twitter's team, who suspended Boivin's account for a week.
That didn't sit too well with Boivin, considering the company doesn't have the best track record of dealing with Nazis, who are sadly ALL OVER Twitter. He said:

"America has this back-ass-wards Calvinist streak where calling for the expulsion and genocide of non-white races is just a difference of opinion. But making a sex joke at a corporate mascot who paid money to advertise to you is cause for censure."
See, now THAT'S a good tweet. (Is it fewer than 140?)
But when Boivin's friend tweeted about his situation, writing:

My old roommate got suspended from twitter for sexually harassing Tony the Tiger. pic.twitter.com/Uanah3oiNu
— Cooper Fleishman (@_Cooper) August 23, 2017

And subsequently Buzzfeed News dropped its article, that's when Boivin's words really got people talking. (The thing he said about censorship, not the Tiger-fucking.)
Here are some of the best responses:

That Time a Parrot Got Cheeky with Prince Harry in the Caribbean/n





                    Please Enjoy These Photos of Prince Harry Playing with Sea Turtles 
                







Prince Harry is a busy man these days.

Prince Harry arrived to St. Vincent and the Grenadines on Saturday (Nov. 26, 2016), the fourth country on his 14-day Caribbean tour, and when he stopped by an aviary, he got a rude welcome.
The Telegraph reports Harry was up close and personal with one parrot, naturally named Polly, who began the conversation by repeatedly saying “hello” to the prince. But when the royal hottie answered, Polly rudely ignored him, and then tried to nip his finger.

“Naughty!” retorted a smiling Harry, pulling his finger back. He then said, “They are amazing. Do you ever let them out?” When told they could get aggressive, he replied, “I can tell.” See the pics above!
The Prince also visited the island’s 250-year-old Botanical Gardens, the oldest tropical botanical garden in the world, and later enjoyed a concert by a choir of 8-11-year-olds from the Kingstown Government School. Watch below!





Earlier last week, Harry visited the Nevis turtle conservation project at Lover’s Beach and even helped release the little guys into the sea.

Brooke's War With Ex Charlie Sheen Continues From Rehab/n
Brooke Mueller had been on the road to recovery at a rehab facility in Utah, but insiders told RadarOnline.com she is distracted by fears that her ex-husband, Charlie Sheen, is going to sell the mansion she lived in with their twin sons.
With all of the drama surrounding the mansion Denise Richards had lived in with daughters, Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, “Brooke thinks it’s only a matter of time until Charlie puts her house up for sale, too,” an insider told Radar. “But she wants to continue to live in the mansion with the boys, and doesn’t want to move out.”
Talks between Mueller’s camp and Sheen’s representatives have stalled as the former Palm Beach socialite has been unable to raise the money to buy the mansion from the Anger Management star. And now her rehab stay has put a pause on the situation, but sources said Mueller, 38, wonders how long Sheen will hold off.

“Brooke’s sobriety is still in the very beginning stages, and the last thing she needs is this additional stress,” the source claimed.
Mueller said that the reason for her most recent relapse was the public revelation that Charlie Sheen, 50, was HIV positive.
“Brooke had a very difficult time in the immediate aftermath of Charlie’s situation going public. Even though she and the twins don’t have HIV, it just brought back a lot of very bad memories of the time when Brooke was married to Charlie,” an insider previously told Radar.

Now, she’s in rehab in Utah, and is expected to remain in treatment for at least three months.

Katy Perry Gets Dragged For Body Shaming YouTuber With Nonstop Fat Jokes In Swish Swish Video/n

Katy Perry finally dropped her Swish Swish music video early Thursday morning, and a lot of people thought it was pretty much an airball.
Critics didn't just dislike it because they found the vid utterly silly and toothless, completely avoiding the combative meaning behind the lyrics, but also because the jokes were seen as dated and immature.
Oh yeah, and also hurtful.
Video: Logic Tells A Powerful Story About Acceptance & Suicide Prevention In 1-800-273-8255
One of the guest stars playing Katy's basketball teammate was vlogger (and Twitter genius) Christine Sydelko (seriously, follow her @csydelko).
Unfortunately, her entire role in the video seemed to be the butt of some really unfunny fat jokes. Her nickname was "Shaquille O'Meals" and her stats were "5.7 tacos per minute." And all she did was eat the entire vid.
Even Christine's own YouTube cohost Elijah Daniel tweeted (but quickly deleted) some scathing criticism of the body shaming bit: 

It doesn't matter that Christine makes fun of her own body and diet; that's her prerogative. It is NOT the same for an international sex symbol to do it for five minutes. And while he may have deleted the tweets above, he posted the following late Thursday afternoon:

👏🏼dont👏🏼mess👏🏼with👏🏼texas👏🏼or👏🏼my👏🏼bitch👏🏼

Of course, Elijah wasn't the only one who had a problem with it. See some of the more severe responses from social media (below)!

Tamra Judge Renews Wedding Vows Amid Estranged Daughter Drama & Reignited Feud With RHOC Alum Gretchen Rossi!/n

Tamra Judge's daughter drama couldn't have come at a worse time.
As we previously reported, the Real Housewives of Orange County star's 18-year-old, named Sidney Barney, recently accused her of emotional abuse in a lengthy rant on Facebook. While Miz Judge and Sidney are very clearly estranged, it seems the Bravolebrity has plenty of love in her life as she just renewed her wedding vows to husband Eddie Judge!

The couple, who originally wed back in 2013, said "I do" again on Eagle Beach in Aruba in honor of the Caribbean's largest vow renewal ceremony. Tamra attempted to take the high road following her daughter's shade as she shared the following on Instagram about the vow renewal: 




Celebrating love ❤️ with all the hate that's going on. May God bless your life because it's not always easy. But God has a plan.. a big plan. I wanna say thank you to @shannonbeador @oclydia @rhoc_kellyddodd (you know what you did and you all rock) #arubaidoA post shared by Tamra Judge (@tamrajudge) on Aug 8, 2017 at 3:15pm PDT


Looks like Tamra's doing just fine without Sidney in her life. The TV personality and her man had loved ones present at the ceremony as Judge revealed to People:

"Aruba is simply beautiful. It meant everything for Eddie and I to be able to ‘renew our I Do's' in such a picturesque setting, in the company of our family. Cheers to a lifetime of love and adventure, from the One happy island!"




What a beautiful evening ❤️Thank you @arubatourism #ArubaIDo #RCMemories Feeling blessed I ❤️@aruba Check out : Facebook.comritzcarlton Facebook.com/Arubafans @ritzcarltonA post shared by Tamra Judge (@tamrajudge) on Aug 8, 2017 at 8:32pm PDT


Now Tamra's RHOC costars Shannon Beador, Lydia McLaughlin, and Kelly Dodd all may've gotten shout outs on the special day, but former Housewives peer Gretchen Rossi obviously didn't get any kind words from Judge as she has since sided with Sidney.
Related: RHONY Cameras Missed Out On Luann & Tom's Divorce Drama!
After Gretchen vocalized her support for Barney online, Tamra accused Rossi of being a "thirsty wannabe" and an "#obsessedfreak." She added on IG:
"I usually don't give this troll any attention because it's exactly what she wants. But after years of her bashing me and now reaching out to my daughter I must say. Gretchen you are the biggest piece of shit I've ever met. Move on with your sad empty childless life and stay out of mine you thirsty wannabe.
You are obsessed with my life and I haven't even seen or spoke to you in 5 years. #MoveOn You have NO IDEA What my family is going through or what the truth is, Nor do you care. It's just an opportunity for you to get your name in the press. #obsessedfreak. Funny you of all people should be talking about morals . You have none!"
Unsurprisingly, this note has since been deleted. Still, damnnnnnnnn.
Tamra has feuds coming her way from all sides. Hopefully, one day, everyone can just get along!

Caitlyn Jenner‘s romance with Candis Cayne was hyped extensively on her reality show, but Cayne has finally admitted what Radar first reported – that they aren’t dating and it isn’t true love!
Featured asking Jenner out on a date in an early episode of I Am Cait, Cayne finally revealed the truth about her relationship with Kris Jenner‘s ex.
“Caitlyn and I are really good friends. I really love her a lot, and it’s been amazing being by her side through this whole process,” she told Access Hollywood Live.

According to a well-connected Kardashian family insider, the 65-year-old “actually held auditions for the role of her transgender BFFs for the television show!”
“Caitlyn didn’t just meet all of these already famous transgender people by accident – of course they were cast and, yes, they are getting paid,” says the source.
“We’re just really, really good friends,” Cayne told Access Hollywood Live, confessing that they aren’t romantically involved, despite the creative editing on the show, and saying that she is into men.

And Cayne defended Jenner against haters, who claim that her transition and struggles are a “fairy tale” thanks to her vast wealth and resources.
“She’s lived her whole life being transgender but never being able to do anything about it,” Cayne explained. “That’s just as hard as somebody like me, who at 24 decided that’s what I had to do with my life in order to be OK with things. So I went through other struggles, but she did also.”

 Because She's Worth It? Kirstie Alley Bought $68 Million In Life Insurance, New Lawsuit.../n
Kirstie Alley’s net worth is reportedly only $30 million, but the actress once bought two life insurance policies totaling $68 million, RadarOnline.com has learned. Now, those policies are at the center of a Ponzi scheme lawsuit, over claims that Alley’s insurance agent, Michelle Seward, got a $1.1 million commission that she then invested in the actress’ controversial diet company.
Alley and Organic Liaison are named as defendants in a lawsuit over an alleged Ponzi scheme spearheaded by Seward, a formerly prominent Scientologist and friend of Alley. Jeffrey and Marguerite Stabile loaned approximately $500,000 of their life savings to Seward, and are suing her and other co-defendants over claims she used their money to fund her luxurious lifestyle as an A-list Scientologist.
According to recently unsealed court documents, Seward acted as Alley’s insurance agent in obtaining two life insurance policies, one for $55 million, and the other for $13 million.
PHOTOS: The War Against Tom Cruise, John Travolta & Kirstie Alley’s Controversial Religion Explained In 17 Clicks!
“It is clear from discovery in this litigation that Michelle Seward was, at a minimum, Kirstie Alley’s agent on a $55 million life insurance policy. That much has been acknowledged by both Ms. Alley and Peggy Crawford at their respective depositions,” the documents state. “It has been discussed throughout this litigation.”
“Further testified to and discussed throughout the litigation, including emails by defendants, is that Ms. Seward was an agent to a $13 million dollar key man policy that was written on the life of Ms. Alley and which I am informed and believed insured largely to the advantage of Ms. Alley,” the plaintiff’s attorney Rob Bastian stated in the legal documents.
During the deposition of Alley’s former assistant and Organic Liaison CEO, Peggy Crawford revealed that the premiums during a three-year period were a whopping $13 million, and financing had to be secured for the payments.
“I can give you an estimate…for the three years above that. Maybe $13 million,” Peggy Crawford stated when asked about the cost of the policies.
PHOTOS: Take A Peek Inside The Amazing New Scientology Training Center
When asked to break down the premiums for the two policies, Crawford stated, “Because the — you know, we financed the policies. They were very expensive premiums far beyond what we could pay so we financed the policy…”
“We obtained premium finance with I think it’s called First Funding, First Funding, and the agreement that Michelle had with Organic Liaison and Kirstie Alley Family – you know, Kirstie Alley for her and her trust was that she (Seward) would pay the commissions from – the interest on the policies,” she said. “And then she (Seward) would invest the remainder of her commissions into Organic Liaison as an investor.”
Crawford claimed that Seward had “wanted to invest in Organic Liaison … but she didn’t have any funds to invest personally, so she wanted to write a key man policy and use the commissions that she earned from the key man policy to invest in Organic Liaison – so she proposed that there was some deal that she had with an insurance company that was of exceptional benefit to the company that also wouldn’t cost the company because the company is a start-up, we didn’t have the funds for an expensive policy, so her commissions would cover the payments on the interest on a premium finance loan as provide additional funds for her to invest.”
The policies were issued in early 2010, but as Seward’s alleged Ponzi scheme unraveled, she began missing payments to the finance company for the premiums.

Alley became concerned about the missed premium payments, and according to the court documents, “Ultimately, Kirstie Alley brought in another financial expert, associated with Morgan Stanley, to see if there was not a better way to finance the policies. Concerned on November 29, 2012, Seward initiated an email exchange with Crawford asking, ‘How did this broker approached you? Is he a Scientologist?'”
Alley decided in March 2013 to terminate the policies.
Alley claimed she worked with a team of scientists to create Organic Liaison, which is meant to “escort you into the world of organic weight loss” by combining an organic diet with “organic and natural diet supplements that replenish your body with essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients without the pangs of starvation or cravings you may have felt on other diet plans,” according to company materials.
Critics believe the plan is based on a Scientology program called the purification rundown, which was even prescribed by L. Ron Hubbard himself.

A final status conference in this new case is scheduled for August 13, with the jury trial scheduled to begin on August 17.
A source close to Alley told Radar the court documents were “not accurate. … I can’t go into details as the deposition is sealed and we are respecting the court’s order. It sounds like the opposing side of the suit is grasping at straws … in an attempt to win this in the press as they know they will lose in the courtroom.” /n

8-Year-Old Boy Kicked Out Of Cub Scouts Because He's Transgender!/n

One step forward, two steps back.
As you may be aware, it's been over three years since the Boy Scouts of America finally started allowing openly gay children in their group — and about a year and a half since they extended that invitation to adult Den Leaders as well.
Unfortunately, it still looks like we're years away from getting true equality in the controversial organization… because an 8-year-old boy was just kicked out of Cub Scouts for being transgender!
Related: Trump Inauguration Singer Jackie Evancho's Sister Is Trans…
Joe Maldonado first joined Pack 87 in Secaucus, New Jersey back in October, but was almost immediately asked to leave due to his gender identity just a month later in November.
According to momma Kristie Maldonado, though, it wasn't other kids who were concerned with his appearance — Joe has been living as a boy for over a year now — it was their parents.
But to make things even worse, Scouts spokesperson Effie Delimarkos actually defended their decision to discriminate against the child in a statement, saying: 

"No youth may be removed from any of our programs on the basis of his or her sexual orientation… Gender identity isn't related to sexual orientation."
So those kids can go kick rocks, we guess?
But before you go blaming this 8-year-old for having a supportive family who's allowing him to live his truth, you can also get kicked out for being Atheist or Agnostic… so there's clearly a lot wrong with this supposed character-building club.
At least the Girl Scouts are tolerant of MTF members!

She may have once played the queen of France, but we're pretty sure Kirsten Dunst is no fan of this particular French subject.The Marie Antoinette star has obtained a three-year restraining order against Jean Christophe Prudhon, a French citizen whom she claims has been stalking her.Here's what went down in court today.

RELATED: What's the Latest on that Halle Berry Peeper-Creeper?

Los Angeles Judge Carol Boas Goodson granted a request the 29-year-old thesp's lawyers made in December to extend an order of protection against Prudhon after her camp said he had bombarded Dunst with more than 50 letters and even showed up at her mother's home in an effort to meet her.The judge originally was set to rule on the matter Dec. 21 but since Prudhorn wasn't actually served in his native France until the day before his court date, Goodson pushed the hearing until today and extended the temporary keep-away already issued.Neither Dunst nor Prudhon attended this morning's proceeding.Per the protection order, the Frenchman must remain 100 yards away from the actress.That's good news for Dunst, who's on a career high at the moment with the accolades she's been receiving for her performance in Lars von Trier's acclaimed new film Melancholia, which is topping many critics' year-end lists.

Britain's Prince Harry Joins Prestigious Army Regiment/nBy SUE LEEMAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER Prince Harry, the third in line to the British  throne, will join the armored division of the army's oldest unit  and could serve in Iraq, the Ministry of Defense said Wednesday.  Harry, 21, will serve in the Blues and Royals regiment of the  venerable Household Cavalry, which already has been deployed to  Iraq.   "It's fair to say that if his squadron goes to Iraq, he will  probably go with it, " a ministry spokesman said on condition of  anonymity in line with ministry policy.  News reports said Harry hopes to lead an armored reconnaissance  troop, which deploys in Scimitar vehicles and acts as the eyes and  ears of the force commander.  There are two divisions within the Household Cavalry: the  armored division, where Harry will train, and the mounted regiment,  which performs ceremonial duties, including guarding the queen on  ceremonial and public occasions.  Clarence House, the office of Harry's father, Prince Charles,  said the young prince will join the Blues and Royals in April after  completing his training at Sandhurst military academy in southern  England. Previous members of the Blues and Royals regiment include Andrew  Parker Bowles, former husband of Charles' wife, Camilla.  James Hewitt, a former lover of Harry's mother, the late  Princess Diana, also was in the Household Cavalry, but in the Life  Guards rather than the Blues and Royals.  After being commissioned as an officer at Sandhurst, Harry will  become a second lieutenant in the Household Cavalry.  Clarence House said the prince based his choice of the Blues and  Royals  "on the variety of roles which the regiment undertakes,  including reconnaissance support to airborne forces right through  to ceremonial duties. "  Although Harry is keen to focus on operational work -- the  Household Cavalry has served in the Falklands, the Gulf, Bosnia,  Kosovo and Northern Ireland -- he may be required to take part in  ceremonial duties.  However, he will escape sentry duty outside Buckingham Palace  because he is an officer.  In an interview to mark his 21st birthday, Harry said he was  keen to fight for his country.   "There's no way I'm going to put myself through Sandhurst and  then sit ... back home while my boys are out fighting for their  country, " he said.  Harry is following a royal tradition by joining the military.  Charles was a pilot with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, and  Harry's grandfather, Prince Philip, had a distinguished career in  the Royal Navy.  Harry's uncle, Prince Andrew, was a Royal Navy pilot and served  in the Falklands war against Argentina.  Prince William, Harry's 23-year-old brother and second in line  to the throne, currently is undergoing military training at  Sandhurst./n
Country Star Reba Slams Madonna For Starting Concert 3 Hours Late — On A MONDAY!/n
Madonna is back to her diva ways!
For her first-ever concert in Nashville, Tenn. on Monday, Madge managed to ruffle some feathers in the audience when she arrived nearly three hours late for the performance.
But it wasn’t just fans who were complaining about the “Living For Love” singer, even country star Reba McEntire — who attended the show — slammed Madonna’s bad behavior.
The famed redhead took to Instagram to bash her pop star peer, showing no mercy when it came to her tardiness.

“At the Madonna concert,” she wrote alongside a photo of the venue. “She’s not on yet…really???”





 At the Madonna concert. She's not on yet…really???
A photo posted by Reba (@reba) on Jan 18, 2016 at 7:45pm PST



The “Going Out Like That” hit-maker kept followers updated on Madonna’s show faux pas, adding another photo later, captioned: “We’re here! Where is she???”
“She came on at 10:31,” Reba huffed on her final post.
To be fair, Madonna has had a difficult year thus far, thanks to an ongoing custody battle over rebellious son Rocco Ritchie, 15.

As Radar previously reported, trouble in paradise first occurred when the teen refused to return to the U.S. (and his mother) over the holidays, after he had accompanied her for the first half of the Rebel Heart Tour.
Reportedly angry over his disobedience, Madonna sought a court order shortly thereafter, forcing Rocco to come home.
So far, Madge has not been successful in getting her son home, as he remains in London with his father, film director Guy Ritchie.
Is Rocco the reason behind Madonna’s bad etiquette? Will she apologize to her fans? Let us know what you think in the comments below! /n

 Kate Gosselin's Scathing Claims Against Jon: Daughter Needed Therapy After Visit With.../n
Picking up their daughter from school early…and alone!
After new reports revealed Kate Gosselin accused her ex-husband Jon of exhibiting “suspicious behavior” around their young daughter, RadarOnline.com can exclusively expose new details about the shocking allegations.
In a Pennsylvania police report obtained by Radar, the Kate Plus 8 star, 41, claimed their daughter— identified as Hannah, now 12, by In Touch— began acting “unusual,” and that her father was giving her preferential treatment.
“Jonathan has been picking her up early from school instead of letting her come home on the bus with her siblings,” Kate told officers, according to the Manheim Township Police Department incident report filed on April 27, 2015.
PHOTOS: So ‘Upset!’ Jon Gosselin Lashes Out After Kate Sends Son Away To Treatment
As Radar reported earlier today, Kate admitted to cops that she had hired a private investigator to trail Jon, 39, and learned that he was at their kids’ school that very minute.
“Katie believed that Jonathan was guarding her and feared that if he saw her or the police, he would take [Hannah] out of school and flee,” cops continued in their report.
The hysterical mother of eight said she intended to send her daughter to a counselor immediately following Jon’s alleged actions.
“She was going to insist that they release [her] into her custody so that she can take [her] to a therapist to see if anything would be disclosed,” police wrote.

According to cops, Kate arrived at the school and discovered Jon wasn’t there. She promptly took her little girl out of class and headed home.
In Touch was first to report the existence of the police report, and Kate’s wild claims about Jon’s drug dealing and kidnapping plans.
Sources close to Jon vehemently denied to Radar that Jon had ever acted inappropriately around Hannah.
“It sounds like Kate is making up stories again,” an insider said.

Supreme Court Justice Scalia -- Thousands Gather To Pay Respects/nJustice Scalia was honored in Washington D.C.

Every current member of the Supreme Court sat in the front row and Justice Clarence Thomas participated in the service. President Obama was not in attendance -- something he's taking heavy criticism from Republican for -- however, he and first lady Michelle paid their respects on Friday at the Supreme Court Building. Donald Trump was quick to attack Obama for the no-show, tweeting,  "I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go! " As TMZ reported ... Scalia died in his sleep last week on a hunting trip in Texas. He was 79-years-old. /n

 Joran van der Sloot Is Still Trying To Get Money From ‘Guardian Angel’ After She Resigned.../n
By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
Joran van der Sloot is continuing to try and garner more funds in his desperate bid to avoid the 28 year sentence that was handed down to him on January 13, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.
The convicted killer, who confessed to the May 2010 murder of Stephany Flores, is still asking his “guardian angel,” Mary Hamer, for money despite her announcing on Sunday that she was no longer going to support him.
A source exclusively told RadarOnline.com that the 24-year-old Dutchman has been manipulating Hamer to give him more money to pay lawyer fees and pay off prison staff.
PHOTOS: Celebs Involved In Murder
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Hamer decided to hang up her angel wings and stop supporting Joran after sinking up to $100,000 into his legal campaign.
In the bizarre resignation letter, Hamer addressed, among others, President Obama, Beth Holloway, and Joran himself.
She told Anderson Cooper last week that she did not believe Joran was manipulating her and continued to plead his innocence. But now the American doctor rants in her resignation letter about the U.S. and Peruvian governments, insists that she is now poor having sacrificed her life savings and her fears that Joran will die from a drug overdose.
PHOTOS: Inside Piedras Gordas Prison
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Joran’s health has deteriorated since being moved to the maximum security prison of Piedras Gordas in northern Lima, Peru following his sentencing.
“His health has suffered and he is not doing well there,” an insider exclusively told RadarOnline.com. “Joran blames the food and the water. He says that he is depressed and feeling weak all the time.”
PHOTOS: Joran Van Der Sloot In Custody
Van der Sloot may have milked his last pennies from Hamer, who announced on Sunday that she has shifted her focus to helping Amir Hekmati, the Iranian-American who was handed a death sentence by the Iranian revolutionary court last month after he was coerced into confessing to charges of espionage.

Frankel No Longer Has To Pay $12,000 Monthly In Spousal Support To Ex Jason Hoppy/n
It’s a victorious time for Bethenny Frankel this week! A state appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Real Housewives of New York star no longer has to pay ex-husband Jason Hoppy monthly spousal support.
“We find that the broad and expansive language used by the parties in their agreement forecloses the husband from seeking any kind of spousal support, including temporary support. After acknowledging and representing that they are ‘fully capable of being self supporting,’ the parties agreed to ‘waive any and all claims for spousal support and/or maintenance’ ‘both now and in the future,'” court documents read.
Frankel has reportedly been paying Hoppy a court ordered total of around $26,000 per month since they split in 2012, including $12,000 in temporary alimony and $10,000 in child support for their daughter Bryn, 5.

Lucky for the 45-year-old, she is no longer responsible for the $12,000 monthly payments to Hoppy.
However, Frankel may not be out of the woods just yet.
The SkinnyGirl mogul must still put up a fight for the $5 million Tribeca condominium she bought while married to Hoppy, who is currently living in the residence.

“Although the wife funded the purchase of the apartment and ordinarily would be considered the settlor, the husband avers that the parties had agreed that the apartment would be joint property, and that consistent with the intention, he made certain payments towards maintenance and renovations,” the documents found. “Nonetheless, issues of fact exist whether the parties intended to jointly own the apartment, and whether the husband was involved in any fraud in the preparation and execution of the trust agreement.”
The court is set to rule whether Hoppy has rights to the property or not at a later date.
“My client is extremely happy that the appeals court rejected his wife’s position that she automatically owns the marital apartment just because she paid for it, and he is looking forward to the appeal’s court directive that a hearing must occur to flesh out his and his wife’s competing claims,” Hoppy’s attorney, Bernard Clair, later said of the matter. /n
Joel Osteen Gets DRAGGED On Twitter For Not Opening Megachurch To Hurricane Harvey Refugees!/n

UPDATE 7:55 P.M. EST: According to TMZ, church officials are now blaming the closure on flooding, saying Lakewood is "inaccessible." Needless to say, bullshit is being called on that excuse as eyewitnesses and now-viral photos report no apparent flooding around the facility (as seen in the tweets below).

In case you're not familiar with Joel Osteen, he's a very, VERY wealthy pastor based in Houston, Texas.
His empire of best-selling books, a Sirius XM radio show, and televised sermons have given him an estimated net worth north of $50 million.

When southeast Texas was hit by unprecedented flooding from Hurricane Harvey, Osteen tweeted:

Victoria & I are praying for everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey. Please join us as we pray for the safety of our Texas friends & family.
— Joel Osteen (@JoelOsteen) August 26, 2017

And that's all he did.
People were quick to note on Twitter that he has not donated any money (that anyone can tell anyway), but more importantly he didn't open the doors of his 16,800-seating megachurch in Lakewood to refugees, despite it being spared from flooding and easily accessible.
See some of the most scathing tweets (below):

Gay Advocacy Groups Up In Arms Over Dr. Oz For Reparative Therapy Show/n
By Radar Staff
Organizations such as GLAAD, PFLAG And GLSEN complained after Wednesday’s edition of The Dr. Oz Show provided a forum for proponents of reparative therapy, a rogue theory that claims one’s sexual orientation can be switched with therapeutic care.
The broadcast featured an appearance from members of the pro-reparative therapy organizations People Can Change, and the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, which has frequently clashed with the medical establishment in regards to the hot button issue.
PHOTOS: 48 Stars Who Have Come Out As Gay Or Bisexual
GLAAD President Herndon Graddick said in a statement that the TV doc was in the wrong to indirectly tout a theory that “has been proven ineffective and dangerous, and has been soundly and conclusively rejected by the entire medical establishment.
“This line of thinking is outdated, ultimately harmful, and in modern media, should be treated like lobotomies or medical mercury.”

The Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network’s executive director Dr. Eliza Byard said Oz should have been more cautious in giving a national stage to a movement that “consistently repudiated as harmful to youth” while The Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays criticized the TV personality for his passive stance throughout the broadcast, essentially legitimizing the theory by not butting in.
“Although the show also featured guests who condemned the idea and practice of ‘reparative therapy,’ Dr. Oz himself never weighed in and the audience was misled to believe that there are actual experts on both sides of this issue,” the group wrote.

In response to the firestorm, Oz wrote a detailed blog on his website saying the show was striving for objectivity by giving proponents of reparative therapy a voice.
We “felt that we needed to include all parties who have considered reparative therapy to hear the stories of people who have tried these treatments,” Oz wrote, later conceding he’s not in favor of it either.

“After listening to both sides of the issue and after reviewing the available medical data, I agree with the established medical consensus. I have not found enough published data supporting positive results with gay reparative therapy and I have concerns about the potentially dangerous effects when the therapy fails, especially when minors are forced into treatments.”

 From Mumbai To Montana – Seven Most Expensive Homes In The World: Take A Peek Inside.../n
Got $1 billion to spare?
If so, you’re one of the privileged few on the planet who can afford the most opulent homes around the globe.
From the ski slopes of Montana to a skyscraper in Mumbai, India, the extremely wealthy can cherry pick exactly where they want to live.
PHOTOS: Take A Look At The Most Expensive Homes In The World
And for those who haven’t got enough cash to make a down payment RadarOnline.com has photos to offer a glimpse into how the rarefied 1 percent lives…
7. The Pinnacle Montana
Owned by real estate developer Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra, this $155 million ski lodge is based in Montana. The well-heeled couple could get lost in their 10 bedroom home. But they’d never get cold because every floor is heated, including the driveway, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com.
The Blixseths also own the Yellowstone Club, a ski resort that only billionaires can belong to.
6. Elena Franchuk’s Victorian Villa
Its price tag is a whopping $161 million. But given that this Victorian villa is located in Kensington, South West London – a plush part of Britain’s capital – it’s no surprise. Its owner is Elena Franchuk – a Ukrainian businesswoman and philanthropist. The property was originally a girls’ prep school. Now it boasts 10 bedrooms, a swimming pool, panic room, a theater, a sauna and a gym.

5. Hearst Castle
William Randolph Hearst – the publishing tycoon who inspired the movie Citizen Kane – built this sprawling estate in 1919. With 29 bedrooms, three pools, a movie theater, a nightclub and several tennis courts, the mansion could house its own little community. In 1957, shortly after the founder’s death, the Hearst Corporation donated the property to the state of California, where it is located. Its current value is $190 million.
4. Fairfield Pond
Built by investor and businessman Ira Rennert, this 63-acre Hamptons, New York compound deserves to be on this exclusive list. Worth $220 million it features 100,000 square feet of buildings, a basketball court, a bowling alley, squash courts and tennis courts. There is also no shortage of space for houseguests given that there are 29 bedrooms and 39 bathrooms.

3. One Hyde Park Penthouse
At $225 million One Hyde Park Penthouse is not your average London flat. It reportedly has six bedrooms, bulletproof windows, a wine-tasting room and an underground tunnel. According to REP Interactive it costs roughly $9,000 per square-foot.
2. Villa Leopolda
Located on the Cote D’Azur, France this palatial estate was built in 1902 and once owned by King Leopold II of Belgium. A Russian billionaire reportedly offered $750 million to buy the property before backing out.
It’s currently without an owner. But prospective buyers might like to consider the 19 bedrooms and 14 bathrooms in addition to the formal gardens that are tended to by 50 full-time gardeners.

1. Antilla
Slumdog Millionaire? Not quite. The most expensive home in the world is based in Mumbai, India – the same place that was the setting for the Oscar-winning film. But with a price tag of $1 billion this 40,000 square-foot mansion is anything but a slum. Stretching up 27 stories, six of those floors house owner Mukesh Ambani’s collection of 168 cars. It also features three helicopter pads on the roof, a home theater, a two-story health center and a Krishna temple. /n
 Robert Wagner Finally Tells All About Natalie Wood Death: 'I Thought My Life Was Over'.../n
Nearly 35 years after his wife Natalie Wood‘s mysterious drowning death, Robert Wagner is finally opening up about the shocking tragedy’s aftermath.
“After When Natalie died, I thought my life was over,” the actor, now 86, writes in new book, I Loved Her in the Movies: Memories of Hollywood’s Legendary Actresses. “Luckily, I had the help of a great many people who loved her and loved me as well.”
He lists Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, Gene Kelly, Delphine Mann, David Niven and the couple’s children for helping him cope with the sudden loss.
Wagner also turned to a psychiatrist named John Lindon.

“This much is gone,” the star claims his doctor told him, pointing to a picture of a heart. “But this much is left, and that can be enough. It has to be enough — for your girls and for yourself.”
Upon returning to work on mystery series Hart to Hart, Wagner was “filled with anxiety,” he admits.
But he credits costar Stefanie Powers with restoring his confidence on camera.
“You’re going to be all right,” she said as she escorted him to set.
PHOTOS: Secret Murders, Frozen Bodies & More! Hollywood’s 15 Most Bizarre Conspiracy Theories EXPOSED
Wagner says he moved on from his wife with Hart to Hart costar Jill St. John “six to eight months” after Wood’s death.
“I owe her everything,” he gushes.
Wood famously disappeared after yachting with her husband and friend Christopher Walken off Santa Catalina Island on November 28, 1981. Her body was discovered one mile from the boat the following morning. She was just 43 years old.
According to the autopsy, she was covered in bruises and had a blood alcohol level of .14%, meaning she had been drinking before she died.

Though the cause of death was originally determined to be “accidental drowning,” it was eventually changed to “drowning and other undetermined factors” when the case was reopened in 2011.
Wood’s sister Lana and others blamed Wagner for her death, but he has always vehemently denied the accusations.

Scott Eastwood is currently in Sydney, Australia to shoot his next film, Pacific Rim: Maelstrom, but he already found time to pull on his swimming trunks and soak up the sun at the city’s popular Bondi Beach, where he happily showed off his abs and pecs.

Soap Star Eric Braeden Plans To Reveal New Secrets In Tell-All Book/n
Eric Braeden sat down with Soap Opera Digest this week to discuss his legendary 37 years as Victor Newman on The Young and the Restless, as well as his upcoming autobiography, I’ll Be Damned.
The memoir, cowritten with Lindsay Harrison, has allowed the actor to revisit numerous chapters of his life — both riveting and heart-wrenching.
“It was an emotional ride,” Braeden shared of the writing process. “One inevitably lives life on a daily basis and sometimes you don’t take the time to reflect, and when you do look back upon periods of your life and discover deeply buried emotions.”

“Let’s just say it’s a good thing there was someone to edit it,” he added with a laugh.
The soap star also revealed his favorite actors to work with, including Marlon Brando, Betty White, Mary Tyler Moore and most of all Jeanne Cooper.
“I had such a deep admiration for her,” he gushed. “I know how tough it is to maintain a career in this business and I have a great respect for her for that. She and I always laughed together. We have many great times.”

As for the future, Braeden revealed his hopes to appear in a few more movies, as well as maintaining his role on The Young and the Restless.
“It’s so easy to get jaded in this business. If you stay in Hollywood, you don’t realize that what you do matters to so many people. What a beautiful thing to know that you can directly affect people’s lives,” he said.

Glen Campbell Remembered by Wife Kim, Country Music Stars and Bill Clinton During Emotional Memorial Service/n
The “Rhinestone Cowboy” is finally at rest.
Family and friends of Glen Campbell said their final goodbyes Thursday to the late singer in Nashville at the CMA Theater in the Country Music Hall of Fame.
Kim Campbell, the iconic singer’s wife, delivered a touching eulogy for her husband, calling him “the love of my life.”
“There were no secrets with Glen. He was the real deal all the time,” she said. “Glen was open and honest about his struggles and humbly gave God all the glory for turning his life around.”
Kim described watching the solar eclipse on Monday, describing how “fear and sadness washed over me” and comparing it to how she was feeling following her husband’s death.
“On the day I lost Glen, I felt like I was in total darkness,” she said. “In the weeks since, I’ve been searching for that new light to emerge from the other side. Waiting for the world to come back to life so that I can see clearly again.”

“As I look at the ring on my finger, the ring that symbolizes the love and light that Glen enveloped me in for the last 34 years, I find immense comfort in knowing that there is light on the other side,” Kim added.
Fellow country music artists attended the service, including Brad Paisley, Larry Weiss (who wrote “Rhinestone Cowboy”), and Jane Seymour, according to Parade.
Paisley performed a medley of the late legend’s songs while Campbell’s time filling in for Brian Wilson was celebrated by Beach Boys members Mike Love and Bruce Johnston, the website reports.
The CMA stage was decorated with Campbell’s most memorable suits, guitars and paintings, while Walk the Line director James Keach spoke about Campbell’s courageous battle with Alzheimer’s. Keach also read a letter from President Bill Clinton that praised the singer’s positive impact on families affected by the disease.
 
Campbell died on Aug. 8, which his family confirmed in a statement on his website.

“It is with the heaviest of hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved husband, father, grandfather, and legendary singer and guitarist, Glen Travis Campbell, at the age of 81, following his long and courageous battle with Alzheimer’s disease … In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Glen Campbell Memorial Fund at BrightFocus Foundation through the CareLiving.org donation page.”
Campbell is survived by his wife of 35 years Kim, daughters Ashley, Debbie and Kelli and sons Cal, Dylan, Kane, Shannon and Travis.

WATCH: ‘Homeland’ Trailer Teases Quinn’s Return in Season 6/n





                    ‘Homeland’ Season Six Will Feature Female President-Elect 
                







Hm.

Showtime released the official trailer for the sixth season of Homeland with just one month to go before it premieres.

Though the cast already revealed that Quinn is alive after his fate was questioned at the end of Season Five, the plausibility of his return has been solidified just a little more in the new season’s trailer. The clip ends with his voiceover asking Carrie (Claire Danes), “What happened to me?”
Additionally, the trailer shows that Season Six’s plot will run parallel with real events in the United States. Elizabeth Marvel will transition into her role as President just as Donald Trump makes his official move into the Whtie House early next year, though a visit from Kanye West isn’t included the trailer. There’s a better chance that he’ll show up in 2024 anyway.

 Heartbreaking Double Tragedy: Scott Disick’s Aunt Says Grief Over Both Parents’ Untimely.../n
Soon-to-be father of three Scott Disick’s recent hospital stay for alcohol poisoning shocked his fans. But those closest to him understand why he would turn to booze and partying — and they want to help him through this trying time, his aunt exclusively tells RadarOnline.com.
Audrey Martone says nephew Disick— who’s expecting his third child with longtime girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian in December— has picked up the bottle while mourning the sudden deaths of his mom Bonnie last October and father Jeffrey just a few months later.
“Scott lost both parents in a very short period of time, and I think being without them right now is a sad reminder,” Martone explains to Radar. “I feel for him and I try to give him the benefit of the doubt. Everyone has their own way of grieving, and I respect that.”
PHOTOS: Scott Disick And Kourtney Kardashian Take Their Son Mason To Nobu Sushi In Malibu
Martone, the sister of Disick’s late father, said in a previous interview with The National ENQUIRER that her nephew has been distant from the family since the funeral in January.
The New York native, who has yet to hear from her reality star relative while he films near her hometown for Kourtney & Khloe Take The Hamptons this summer, worries that living in his old stomping grounds may trigger some painful memories for Disick.

“They’re out in an area of Long Island where there are reminders of his parents,” she noted. “He might need some time to heal.”
The flashy entrepreneur was rushed to Southampton Hospital in June after a belated birthday celebration ended with a dangerous cocktail of booze and prescription pills, Radar confirmed.
Disick’s hard-partying lifestyle has been a point of contention between him, his baby mama and her famous family for years: Kardashian even kicked him out of their rental home last month until he cleaned up his act.

Disick’s other family members, who still live on Long Island, found out about his medical emergency through the media.
“I didn’t know anything. Someone from work actually told me they read about it,” Martone admitted.
Fortunately, insiders tell Radar the star is on the mend.

Both Anna, 40, and Chris, 38, released a statement on their decision.

Billy Bush Finds A Friend In Brooke Burke-Charvet: 'I Have Great Sympathy For Billy'/n

Nobody puts BB in a corner.
Billy Bush is currently experiencing the proverbial rock bottom of his career, but not everyone in Hollywood is vilifying the TV personality for his role in Donald Trump's latest sexism scandal.
As you've surely heard by now, audio from a 2005 Access Hollywood interview leaked on Friday, clearly detailing the former Celebrity Apprentice host and soon-to-be former TODAY Show host degrading women with their "Grab them by the P*ssy" locker room talk.
Related: NBC Has Already Replaced Billy Bush With Carson Daly
While Billy's coworkers remain pretty divided on the subject — Tamron Hall, Al Roker, Matt Lauer, and Nancy O'Dell are decidedly anti-Bush with Kit Hoover and Natalie Morales staying more neutral — fellow TV presenter Brooke Burke-Charvet is actually sympathetic to his situation!
Speaking to PEOPLE on Tuesday, the former Dancing with the Stars host defended Billy's blunder as an understandable mistake, saying: 

"I have great sympathy for Billy because I've had to wear a microphone for 12 hours a day on shows. You go to the bathroom and you are mic'd. So, kind of in his defense, there is a lot of stuff that goes on behind the scenes. Quite honestly, sometimes you're trying to just roll through a conversation without any commitments to it.
I feel for Billy now because I know how much is captured and how many people are really listening when you are on a set and you have a microphone on. I don't think America probably understands that there are a lot of inappropriate conversations that happen all the time.
I feel for him. He just moved his family to New York for the TODAY job. That's a big deal. Now what is he supposed to do?"
While that's very true about Billy's wife Sydney Davis and three daughters Josie, Mary, and Lillie being innocent victims in all this… but they're victims of their breadwinner's gross behavior and poor judgment.
As a family man, he should have had better sense than the sexist, racist Republican.
Related: NBC Is Allegedly Already Negotiating Billy Bush's Exit!
Coincidentally, Brooke will be starring on Arnold Schwarzenegger's New Celebrity Apprentice this January. So all new opportunities for inappropriate conversations while mic'd.
Do U think Billy has any other supporters in Hollywood??

herself. After agreeing to help Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) ambush Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and her friends in Alexandria, Sasha takes a pill provided by Eugene (Josh McDermitt) and dies en route in a coffin and attacked Negan when he revealed .../n
Don't cry for Sonequa Martin-Green. This is your obvious spoiler warning.The Walking Dead actress said goodbye to the world of zombies, barbed wire bats and endless dirt in the season seven finale when her character, Sasha, killed herself. After agreeing to help Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) ambush Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and her friends in Alexandria, Sasha takes a pill provided by Eugene (Josh McDermitt) and dies en route in a coffin and attacked Negan when he revealed her in Alexandria. Zombie Sasha was eventually found by Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Jesus (Tom Payne) and put down by Maggie.

"It just felt so right," Martin-Green said on Talking Dead. "It felt so complete. It was quite poetic when I found out how it was going to happen. Because I felt like it was the perfect end to my story, the perfect culmination of my life. I felt like all of my roads had led to that moment of getting to that place of complete selflessness. It felt perfect."Martin-Green was struck by how her character became the weapon she wanted, she used herself to save her friends for a final time.

"In this beautiful way, it was the first time we had ever rooted for a walker. Also, it was beautiful because the way I saw it, that warrior spirit lives on. That even in death, I was still going to fight, because I had realized my purpose. It had been revealed to me," she told host Chris Hardwick. "Everything before that had been self-preservation, self-defense mechanisms, basically self-obsession. And over the course of my life as Sasha, it was progressing beyond that to the point that I said, ‘OK, I now have a greater purpose that is much bigger than me, that's for the future, and I'm going to do it even in death.'"Martin-Green is off to star in Star Trek: Discovery as the franchise's first female lead of color.

As for what's next with The Walking Dead when the series returns for season eight in the fall, showrunner Scott M. Gimple had this to say:"Every year you ask me that question," Gimple said. "I say it's going to be bigger, it's going to be more intense. I say these things and I've meant them every year and I think we've actually accomplished that. This year, same thing: More intense. The first four episodes will melt people's minds and break their televisions."

The romance between Princess Diana and the handsome doctor she fell in love with in the years after her split from Prince Charles has become the stuff of legend.In the final weeks before her tragic death in Paris in 1997, friends say it was Hasnat Khan—and not Dodi Al-Fayed, the man killed alongside her in that violent car crash—who was occupying her thoughts.The affair with the heart surgeon had begun two years before. They met when she visited a friend at the London hospital where he worked. Minutes after first laying eyes on him, she described him as "Mr. Wonderful"—a nickname which stuck and ultimately sent the press into a frenzy when the media found out about her new suitor a few months later.The War of the Wales had left Diana a husk of her former self. Being cast out of the royal family meant she was fraught with insecurities and loneliness. Yet despite the breakdown of her marriage, the public's fascination with her life seemed to only increase with each passing month. The Princess of Wales (she was allowed to keep her title) was hounded everywhere she went.

But her relationship with the press was mutually beneficial; the year Diana met Hasnat, 1995, coincided with the explosive "there were three of us in this marriage" interview she gave to the BBC's Martin Bashir. In Hasnat, Diana found comfort.  As a friend of hers told me recently, "She was extremely lonely by the time they met. She had lost everything and because things had gotten so bad with Charles, she didn't know who to trust."

"She felt rejected and discarded and then along came this incredibly kind and compassionate man," the friend said. "Unlike some of the people in her life who had sold her out to the press, Hasnat didn't care about her fame. He was different and she knew she could rely on him."

The couple had an intense love affair for the next two years. There were clandestine meetings at his flat and also Kensington Palace, and she even introduced him to Prince William and Prince Harry; however, not many other people got to meet him, as Hasnat would often sneak past the royal security guards by hiding in the trunk of a car.In an exhaustive statement given to the final inquest into her fatal car crash, Hasnat described how being together exposed the woman, who once thought she would be queen, to the normality of everyday life: "Diana was also not used to doing everyday things that the rest of us take for granted. For example, we once went to the pub together and Diana asked if she could order the drinks because she had never done so before. She really enjoyed the experience and chatted away happily to the barman. On another occasion we had to queue to get into Ronnie Scott's jazz club. She later said she loved queuing as you get to meet so many people."

In the limited time they were together, they discussed marriage, the possibility of moving in and all the usual things lovers contemplate when considering a future. But, in the summer of 1997, it all came crashing down and they decided to split. In the years since, it is often written that Hasnat was "the love of her life" but was unable to handle the public attention which accompanied her fame or bridge the cultural divide between her English aristocrat and his Pakistani upbringing. The doomed circumstances have always fascinated me, the idea that Diana could have died while in the middle of trying to make her ex jealous by publicly dating international playboy Dodi. What led to her decision to be in Paris on the night she died? Was it really her way of taking revenge and trying to get Hasnat back?And was there a possibility that, if she hadn't been in the car that night, Diana and Hasnat would have found a happier ending?But as I started contacting Diana's circle of friends, a different version of her story began to emerge.

"Hasnat was not the love of her life, at all," says one member of her inner circle. "The truth is she didn't want to be with Hasnat in the end. Diana is the one who actually decided they weren't suited. It had nothing to do with religion or her fame. She didn't think he would be the best person to help co-parent William and Harry."Diana's biggest fear was that one day she might lose the access she had to her children. She didn't think Hasnat was a suitable father figure. He had his own issues and she didn't want to give the royal family an excuse to find fault with whoever she chose to end up with. She just couldn't risk it."Diana's own childhood had been difficult. Her family was pulled apart after her parents split and her mother lost custody. The last thing Diana wanted was for William and Harry to have anything resembling her own upbringing. She and Charles had finally been granted a divorce in 1996 and together they had been able to shelter the children from much of the drama playing out on the front pages of the newspapers.

"She didn't want a repeat of her own history," says her friend. "Hasnat was never going to be the security blanket she needed. And that was top of her mind when she walked away from him. In the end, Diana was very honest with Hasnat about why he wasn't right for her. She loved him but not enough to compromise."Hasnat was definitely not the love of Diana's life, Charles was!"When we think back to Diana and Charles' marriage, it's easy to remember why they were so unsuited, from their 13-year age difference to their affairs—his with Camilla Parker Bowles and hers with James Hewitt. The challenges were extreme and plentiful.

"And yet she always regretted the end of the marriage," says a confidante who spoke to her in her final year. "Diana was devastated when it finally ended. Honestly, she was hurt beyond belief."She spoke about it to friends. She was very aware that the bitterness that grew from the divorce was simply that the worst of situations brought out the worst in people."The source claims the marriage didn't break down because of a lack of love, but rather because Diana wasn't given the right support or preparation for her role as future queen (the couple only met 12 times before he proposed). That is something the royal family seems to have successfully corrected with William's long courtship and eventual union with Kate Middleton.

"There was really no one around to give her guidance after she was thrust into the marriage and the spotlight," says someone who discussed the issue with Diana. "And anyone that she was confiding in at the time seems to have been giving her the wrong advice."Diana and those closest to her didn't understand what marrying Charles really entailed. His role was to the throne and no matter what, that had to come first. He was raised to be King but neither the royal family nor her friends really explained to her what that actually meant and that contributed to the breakdown of the marriage."In her final years she came to the realization, if she had had the right people in her circle things might have been different. She really did love Charles, he was the father of her children, so who knows what might've happened if she'd had a different understanding of what she was taking on?"

This August marks the 20-year anniversary of Diana's death and yet even after two decades, there are still so many questions that remain about her life and loves. But there is one thing her closest friends seem certain of—the man who broke her heart, the one who got away, was not Hasnat Khan.It was actually Prince Charles.

Fans had long suspected that minor characters Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland were an item, but after the Sheriff helped save the deputy, they finally admitted their love for one another! 

What makes the news even greater is the finale actually premiered on Disney Channel's sister network Disney XD, which is targeted at boys!
Gravity Falls joins Nickelodeon's The Legend of Korra and Cartoon Network's Steven Universe, Clarence, and — to a lesser extant — Adventure Time as cartoons with out gay characters.

This weekend, Taylor Swift  will officially enter into the other side of 25. Sunday marks her 26th birthday, which means it's probably all downhill from here. (Hold on to your youth, Tay!)That being said, her 26 years have been pretty good so far. She's been kind of #blessed, it's safe to say. But, dare we add, she has given back to the world just as much as the world has bestowed its graces upon her.Yes, we as a society are also #blessed by Saint Swifty on an almost daily basis. She is an actual angel sent from heaven, and we have proof:1. Well, for one, she looks like an actual angel.

Glowing. Ethereal. Otherworldly. Even with a...gulp...bob. (We still miss you, flowing locks of Tay).2. She descends down from her throne to bestow love advice to unsuspecting forlorn fans.

She is so, so wise.3. She is a lover of animals.

Let's be real, her cats live much better lives than most of us do, and that's not even taking into account the fact that Calvin Harris is their personal photographer. 

4. She is so good to her friends squad.

"Hey ladies! Wanna come to my concert and pretend you're not only a model but also a rock star?! It will be amazing and everyone in the world will be jealous of our life! I love you guys!" 5. She's always helping the kids.

JK, this is actually Taylor at the VMAs, but the looks are basically one and the same. You get the idea.7. She was so moved by a blog post written by a mom who lost her son to cancer that she wrote a song in his memory.

8. Her dance moves can be compared to those of a siren from Greek mythology.

If sirens used their voices to lure ships to the dangerous rocks, then Swifty uses her bitchin' dance moves. Don't get too close!9. Her song lyrics touch you deep down in your soul, in places you didn't even know existed.

How does she know what our hearts are thinking all the time?!10. She is the next Martha Stewart (kind of).

Because she is in love with love, like a real-life cupid.12. She's very comfortable in the presence of royals, both British royalty and music royalty.

Only angels can do that.

And lastly, the most important reason she's an angel sent to us from up above:13. She spends her money and free time on charitable causes.

The list of things Taylor has done for the less fortunate is a whole other article in itself, but her being named the most charitable celeb in 2013 should tell you all you need to know. Here are just a few instances of charity work she's been involved with over the past couple of years:• Donated $100,000 to the Nashville Symphony (2013)• Invited a young cancer patient to attend the ACMS with her (2012)• Headlined a London benefit for homeless youth (2013)• Donated $100,000 to the Red Cross (2008)• Donated $4 million to a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum (2012) • Donated $500,000 to Nashville flood relief (2010)• Countless visits to children's hospitals• Donated $10,000 to the Horace Mann School for the Deaf (2012)We love you, Saint Swifty! And to quote the great Beyoncé, we can see your halo.(Originally published on Tue., Aug. 5, 2014 at 12:55 PM PDT)

Lloyd Webber Cleared of "Phantom" Filching/n
Looks like Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber didn't need any help making the music of the night, after all.        A federal jury ruled Tuesday that the pop music maestro did not steal the main theme from his Phantom of the Opera from an obscure church-music composer, ending a contentious battle that has dragged out in court for eight years.        Ray Repp, a Baltimore-based composer and clothing salesman, cast the first stone in 1990, suing Lloyd Webber, claiming a riff in the British tunesmith's 1986 opus filched a 1978 Repp ballad called "Till You."        Lloyd Webber countersued, saying he never heard of Repp or "Till You." The Broadway mogul said if the melodies sounded alike, it was because Repp must have lifted his from "Close Every Door," a tune from Lloyd Webber's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, written in 1969. But Repp contended he never heard Joseph until after he wrote his ballad.        So the lawyers for both parties lined up musicologists, who pointed out how each composer ripped off the other. At one point Repp's suit was tossed out. Then it was reinstated on appeal. Lloyd Webber even asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the lawsuit, but the high court sent it back to federal court.        The case played out in a New York courtroom in recent weeks, with Lloyd Webber himself taking the stand Monday to dispute ever swiping others' music. He swore he never listened to the radio so he could avoid similar suits in the future.         "I hate it when it's in a restaurant or in a car or a taxi," Lloyd Webber said. "My driver has instructions never to have the radio on."        It took jurors just two hours to decide the case.        "He's going to be happy with the result. He didn't copy the song," defense lawyer Jane Stevens said of Lloyd Webber, who was not in court when the verdict was read.

Madonna & Guy Ritchie Urged to Resolve Custody Battle Over Son Rocco, 15, and Take Pressure Off Teen A New York Supreme Court judge has urged Madonna and ex-husband Guy Ritchie to come to an agreement to end their custody battle over the.../n
A New York Supreme Court judge has urged Madonna and ex-husband Guy Ritchie to come to an agreement to end their custody battle over their 15-year-old son, Rocco Ritchie, adding that they need to stop pressuring him.The teen had left the pop queen's Rebel Heart world tour last year and stayed with his father in London. He currently attends school there. Justice Deborah Kaplan had ruled in December that Rocco was to return to be with his mom, whose primary residence is in New York. Guy's lawyer had said the teen did not want to go back to the city. Madonna, who has in recent months posted a slew of photo tributes to Rocco, had wanted the judge to enforce the order, while Guy's lawyer moved for it to be withdrawn.On Wednesday, the judge told Madonna and Guy she would not vacate the order to return the boy to New York but would also not pull him out of school in London. She also said his parents need to take the pressure off him.

Both parents listened via speakerphone, with their lawyers present in the courtroom. Madonna's lawyer said the singer is not asking for Rocco to be removed from school.The attorney also expressed sarcasm about Guy, saying, "He taught his son court orders are not important."A court-appointed lawyer representing Rocco said the teen is currently dealing with a lot of uncertainty and wants to continuing his studies in London. The attorney added this has been a very difficult time for the teen and that she was encouraged the family was starting to heal and is hopeful a solution will be found. The case remains open. It was almost concluded; Madonna and Guy's lawyers told the judge had discussed a custody agreement but were unable to agree on it.The judge, who also worked on the former couple's divorce case, told the court Wednesday she remains hopeful Madonna and Guy will be able to come to an agreement that is in the best interest of their son. She also encouraged both parties to work with Rocco's attorney."In the seven years since the family has been assigned to me, this is the first issue we've had with their children," the judge said.Rocco is Madonna and Guy's eldest child together. They also share another son, David, 10, who lives with and travels with the singer and his sister Mercy, 10. Madonna's eldest child, daughterLourdes Leon, 19, is currently studying at the University of Michigan.

Shocking Probe: Muhammad Ali Investigated By FBI For Allegedly Fixing Fights/n
Legendary boxer Muhammad Ali was the target of an FBI investigation for allegedly fixing two of his heavyweight title bouts with challenger Leon Spinks, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.
After pouring through more than 600 pages of government documents, Radar can now blow the lid off the files to reveal the explosive dirt the FBI had on one of the country’s most beloved sports figures, who died last summer at 74.
The most shocking revelation details the Criminal Investigative Division’s probe into allegations that Ali and Spinks fixed their two infamous 1978 fights.
Spinks stunned the boxing world by beating the champ during the first fight in February 1978 in Nevada, but then lost the heavyweight belt in a rematch the following September in New Orleans’ Superdome.
PHOTOS: Grave Embarrassment! Muhammad Ali’s Headstone Cost Less Than $500 — Despite $80M Net Worth
“Top Rank Inc….planned to induce Muhammad Ali to throw the 2/15/78 fight with Spinks as well as a possibility of inducing Spinks to throw a subsequent rematch with Ali,” the papers state.
The FBI files do not reveal the final outcome of the probe.
The documents also prove the FBI feared terrorists in Zaire would kidnap the fighters during the 1974 “Rumble in the Jungle” between Ali and George Foreman.
“There is a possibility of terroristic activity against the fighters in Zaire with even a ransom attempt as one plan of action,” a September 24, 1974 memo reads.
PHOTOS: See The Powerful Final Portraits Of Muhammad Ali
For years, the FBI closely monitored Ali’s every step, including a list of every one of his speeches as prominent member of the Nation of Islam.
However, ruthless FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was terrified that his secret investigation targeting Muhammad Ali would embarrass him and the Bureau if the boxer found out.
The fear was spelled out in a May 13, 1966 memo to the heads of four field offices where he demanded to learn the identities of three Pakistani women seen with the champ at a Las Vegas hotel around the time he fought Floyd Patterson.
“It is not felt that we should conduct any investigation concerning his personal activities which could result in (Ali) Clay possibly charging the Bureau with harassment,” the documents state. “If such investigations should come to Clay’s attention, he might take action which could prove embarrassing to the Bureau.”

Brad & Angelina Forced To Cough Up Over $700,000 In Bitter Legal Battle/n
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie may not be together anymore, but they were forced to join forces when a French lighting designer sued them for over $700,000!
Odile Soudant took the couple to court in France in April for not paying her for the extensive work she had done on their Provence estate Chateau Miraval and for damaging her reputation by not crediting her for the job she had already done.
“I am an artist and this is my work. When someone tries to steal my work it is something else,” she told The Guardian. “This is all very painful for me.”
Pitt, 53, had hired Soudant to light several buildings on the sprawling estate he and Jolie, 42, shared.

“He wanted to make it an exceptional place and believed that light should be at the heart of this,” said Soudant, who claimed Pitt gave her “carte blanche” on the project.
Soudant employed 17 experts for the project and billed her famous employees monthly, but after costs ran over and the work behind schedule, Pitt reportedly stopped paying.
The designer’s pleas to Pitt to pay up were of no use, and she had to close shop after she couldn’t pay her contractors and subcontractors for the work already completed.
Despite not paying, Pitt continued to ask Soudant for her help, according to court records.

“Odile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish,” Pitt emailed the designer.
“I don’t know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don’t attack friends,” he also blasted by email. “I’ve been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let’s finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend.”
Pitt wrote in another email: “Don’t waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don’t worry about the rest.”
A French appeal court ruled in the spring that the work stoppage was not Soudant’s fault and awarded her over $700,000.

However, insisted Soudant, the damage was done and she now wants to be officially recognized for the Miraval project, which she was forced to hand off to someone else to complete.
“Of course, people think Brad Pitt is right, that ‘he’s the good guy and she is wrong,’” she blasted.
“I am an artist and this is my work. When someone tries to steal my work it is something else,” she said. “This is all very painful for me.”

Oprah, Dick Van Dyke and More Remember Mary Tyler Moore as TV Tributes Are Set to Air in Upcoming Days/n

Rest in peace.

Members of the entertainment industry and television networks are coming together to pay tribute to Mary Tyler Moore’s life and cultural influence after she passed away on Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017.

Oprah Winfrey, a lifelong admirer of Moore, spoke with Entertainment Tonight’s Nancy O’Dell over the phone on Wednesday night and tearfully expressed her gratitude for Moore’s existence.
“What I’m grateful for is that, in my lifetime, I was able to share with her what her presence in television had meant to me as a young, growing, aspiring reporter,” said Winfrey. “It’s the first time that I can recall a public figure in recent years passing — and we’ve lost so many people recently — where I actually sat down and shed tears about it.”
Winfrey described her as a “role model” for “young single women in the workforce” and recalled that Moore inspired her to pursue her own brand.
“Mary Tyler Moore first gave me the idea that you can own your own show and produce it. She was the one,” Winfrey said. “So, when I say that she had a powerful influence on me, it wasn’t just being that iconic figure that was women in the workforce, doing the same job I was doing, working in news as a journalist, in a newsroom, and who was single and really OK with it. Every episode wasn’t about trying to find a man, it was about trying to find your way in life.”
“She paved the way through storytelling for women and was a value system for women without even knowing it. So, her legacy will live on in ways I know the creators of [The Mary Tyler Moore Show] never even imagined.”
CBS will broadcast a special one-hour CBS News tribute to Moore called Mary Tyler Moore: Love Is All Around tonight (Jan. 26, 2017) at 9 p.m. EST. It will be hosted by Oprah’s closest friend and CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King.

Dick Van Dyke, who portrayed Moore’s husband on The Dick Van Dyke Show, remembered his dear friend in an essay for The Hollywood Reporter. He wrote, “I don’t know what made her comic timing so great. On Dick Van Dyke, we had Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie, both of whom were old hams and had razor-sharp timing, and mine wasn’t bad either. But Mary just picked it up so fast. She had us all laughing after a couple of episodes. She just grabbed onto the character and literally turned us into an improv group, it was so well-oiled. That show was the best five years of my life.”

10 Unforgettable Mary Tyler Moore Quotes

Jimmy Fallon paid tribute to Moore in a segment on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, revealing that his high school yearbook quote was from the iconic Chuckles the Clown episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. 
“She was a pioneer, not just for television and comedy, but for women. Her character on The Mary Tyler Moore Show was really the first single working woman on TV.”
Watch his monologue here:


Michelle Obama spoke about how Moore influenced her when she was growing up as well in an interview with Variety in August, prior to Moore’s death.
“She was one of the few single working women depicted on television at the time,” Obama told Variety (via Entertainment Weekly). “She wasn’t married. She wasn’t looking to get married. At no point did the series end in a happy ending with her finding a husband — which seemed to be the course you had to take as a woman. But she sort of bucked that. She worked in a newsroom, she had a tough boss and she stood up to him. She had close friends, never bemoaning the fact that she was a single. She was very proud and comfortable in that role.
“I was probably 10 or 11 when I saw that, and sort of started thinking, ‘You know what? Marriage is an option. Having a family is an option. And going to school and getting your education and building your career is another really viable option that can lead to happiness and fulfillment.”

Other upcoming television tributes will include…

 ‘Completely Heartbroken’ Kim Kardashian Exposes Fears About Raising Biracial Kids.../n
Kim Kardashian is taking the recent shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile to heart.
The 35-year-old penned a blog post, detailing the struggle of parenting North and Saint West as black children.
“Like a lot of you guys, I watched the videos, and was appalled and completely heartbroken,” she began. “I was left speechless, angry and numb.”
“I want my children to grow up knowing that their lives matter,” she continued.

“I do not ever want to have to teach my son to be scared of the police, or tell him that he has to watch his back because the people we are told to trust—the people who ‘protect and serve’—may not be protecting and serving him because of the color of his skin.”
“It is our responsibility as Americans and as parents to create a safe future for our children,” the KUWTK star wrote. We must do something NOW. We must speak up until we are heard and real, effective changes are made.”
“Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Sean Bell … and unfortunately so many more,” she concluded. “Hashtags are not enough. This must end now.”

Ruby Rose is responding to those who questioned her recently cancelling tour dates. In an impassioned Twitter rant posted on Saturday morning, the actress-turned-DJ defended her decision to opt out of a couple shows after she reportedly came down with tonsillitis. After Rose shared a photo on Instagram initially explaining the sudden change in plans, fans took to social media to express their disappointment over her decision."Tonsilitis and unable to fly because of the pain it's causing my ears," the Orange is the New Black Star wrote. "means no more shows and I have to stay put before returning home sorry guys. I didn't even know you could get tonsillitis after like, 16."When a Twitter user questioned her lack of appearance at a U.K. pride festival, Rose clapped back with an explanation that alluded to her demanding schedule as the main reason for her illness.

Hearing Day Two: Lawyers Argue Bill Cosby Too 'Blind' To Defend Himself/n
Bill Cosby arrived for his second pretrial hearing on Wednesday, with his defense team at the ready for seeking a dismissal on the 2004 case of the alleged sexual assault of Andrea Constand.
All in all, this week’s hearings are expected to determine if a 2005 deposition in Constand’s civil case can be used in the criminal trial; if Cosby’s near blindness makes him unable to defend himself and properly recall his accusers; and if the actor’s right to due process was violated by the long delay in investigators building a criminal case, especially when the civil suit against him had already been dropped, Deadline reports.

Cosby’s lawyer, Angela Agrusa, harped on the delay in particular, claiming the charges stemmed from Kevin Steele‘s election campaign for district attorney against Castor last year in Montgomery County.
“In his campaign, he elected to platform against Mr. Castor on the theory that he would be tougher on sexual predators like Mr. Cosby,” Agrusa said. “We believe this case is not about (a) deposition. It’s about a prosecutorial change of policy.”
“While the government did nothing for a full decade, it gained tremendous strategic advantage over Mr. Cosby,” Agrusa continued, citing the convenient loss of evidence, the loss of key witnesses (including Cosby’s late attorney Wally Phillips), as well as the comedian’s ailing health.

Remembering Big Ang: 'Mob Wives' To Air Tribute Episode For Late Star/n
As friends and family debate whether or not VH1 should air a new episode of Mob Wives on Wednesday night following the death of Angela “Big Ang” Raiola, RadarOnline.com has learned that the network has a special tribute in the works to remember the late reality queen.
“The next three episodes will be dedicated to her,” Mob Wives Executive Producer and Creator Jennifer Graziano told RadarOnline.com exclusively.
At the end of the season, VH1 will have more specific dedications to Raiola.
“Then there will be a special part of the reunion with Ang, as well as a tribute episode to her that will air sometime after the reunion,” Graziano said.

On top of that, “we are running marathons of her spinoff shows,” Graziano confirmed.
It’s important for all who have worked with Raiola that they remember their friend and coworker.
“Ang became close to everyone at VH1,” Graziano explained. “She was extremely close to the show runners and producers. Everyone, as a whole, feels like they lost a friend, not only someone they worked with.”

Graziano also has a long-running history with the Raiola.
“We were friends before the show and got closer during it,” she said. “I’m glad that the world will still get to see her on television. The stuff you can find of her online—videos, interviews—still gets the laugh. But as a friend, I am sad still.”
Graziano still feels Raiola’s presence.
PHOTOS: Celebrities React To Big Ang’s Tragic Death
“I had a funny moment with [Raiola’s friend] Vinnie Medugno this morning,” Graizano recalled. “One of the songs that we all sang together came on in the car. He texted me saying, ‘It’s a sign.’ The song was ‘Young Hearts Run Free.'”
As Radar previously reported, Raiola passed away last week after a brave battle with brain and lung cancer at just 55 years old.
Her family threw four wakes over the weekend in Brooklyn to honor the reality star.

On Monday, Mob Wives, family and friends all gathered together at Basilica of Regina Pacis in Brooklyn for Raiola’s funeral service.
After, she was laid to rest at the Cemetery of the Resurrection in Staten Island.
Following the burial, everyone gathered at Raiola’s favorite restaurant, Angelina’s, to celebrate her life—and her costars Karen Gravano and Natalie Guercio continued to mourn together later on in the night at the Funky Monkey (Raiola’s former bar, which was previously called the Drunken Monkey). /n
Mariah Carey Admits She Struggles with 'Low Self-Esteem': 'I Can't Measure What Type of Respect I Deserve'
/n
Mariah Carey is one of music’s most extravagant stars, bringing her signature glitz and glamour to red carpets, magazine covers, and concert stages everywhere. But behind all the glitter is a woman who still struggles with her confidence.
During a candid interview with the New York Post‘s Page Six backstage at Carey’s concert at Madison Square Garden, the “Heartbreaker” songstress revealed that she doesn’t see herself as the self-assured diva her fans think she is.
“I just feel like I am a regular human being and I deserve the same respect as anybody else,” Carey told the publication, while sitting in her all-white dressing room with Jo Malone candles. “I have always had low self-esteem, and people do not recognize that.”
“Growing up different, being biracial, having the whole thing where I did not know if I fit in … That is why music became such a big part of my life, because it helped me overcome those issues,” she continued. “Sometimes it is hard to let your guard down.”
Mariah CareyFilmMagic/FilmMagic
That also makes it hard for Carey to trust the people around her. “I do think to myself, ‘Did they mean this? Or do they not really mean it?’ ” she revealed. “And that is with everybody — it is not just with three people or just one.”
She added: “I can’t measure what type of respect I deserve — I really can’t.”

Elsewhere in the chat, Carey opened up about life before she found fame.
“I remember it not being easy getting a record deal,” she said. “Making demos in the middle of the night, sleeping on the floor in the studio, being broke with no food. My go-to meal was [Newman’s Own] sauce. Me and my friend would split the pasta and sauce for, like, a week. Or it was, like, a bagel and iced tea … The guy would give it to me at the deli for free.”
These days, she has a little more money for food — but is still hustling, staying busy with her Vegas residency and her All the Hits tour this summer alongside Lionel Richie.
Among her other projects? “I am working on a new fragrance,” Carey said. “I don’t have a name … But it is with Elizabeth Arden. It smells like success. There is also a secret song I have been working on.”

Dismissed! Megyn Kelly Makeup Artists' Sexist Suit Against Fox News THROWN OUT/n
Megyn Kelly‘s former makeup artists’ legal battle with Fox News has been dismissed, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
Hilda Correa-Lapolla and Maureen Walsh previously sued the network for discrimination and harassment in a New York court last year.
Correa-Lapolla began working at Fox News back in 1996 until she was fired in 2014. She was repeatedly requested by the on-air talent to work as their makeup artist and received numerous positive performance reviews.
PHOTOS: Truth Exposed! 15 Most Shocking Revelations From Parts 1 & 2 of Duggar Interviews With Megyn Kelly — Josh Duggar A “Sly” Predator
Meanwhile, Walsh worked for the network for over 10 years and served as Megyn Kelly’s personal makeup artist — even traveling on assignments with the anchor.
According to the court documents filed against Fox News, the women described the office as a “boys club” that protected male employees at all costs. They accused the late former President Roger Ailes of creating and condoning the environment.
READ THE COURT DOCUMENTS
The suit also claimed men were allowed to use “locker room talk” with pervasive sexism and vulgarity, while women at the company were allegedly objectified by their bosses.
When the makeup artists complained to numerous supervisors that male employees allegedly called them “b*****s” and “overpaid drama queens,” they were ignored and eventually terminated, court documents argue.
The women sued Fox News for unspecified damages over the emotional distress, humiliation, and anxiety they suffered at the company.

Fox News soon fired back at their former employees, however, denying all allegations. Instead, the network claimed both women were fired for misconduct, arguing that the pair received multiple complaints from former co-workers who stated that they were bullies in their department.
On July 18, court documents were filed by Correa-Lapolla and Walsh, as well as the Fox News, explaining that all parties had agreed to discontinue the lawsuit.
While the documents do not reveal whether a confidential settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and Fox News, the case was closed the same day.

replacing her bestie Naomi Watts to star opposite Pattinson in Queen of the Desert, a period piece about British writer, traveler, archeologist and spy Gertrude Bell. "That's OK, I'll be ready," Kidman told me about the T.../n
Nicole Kidman underestimates Robert Pattinson's rabid Twilight fan base.If you haven't heard by now, the Oscar winner is likely replacing her bestie Naomi Watts to star opposite Pattinson in Queen of the Desert, a period piece about British writer, traveler, archeologist and spy Gertrude Bell."That's OK, I'll be ready," Kidman told me about the Twi-fans when I caught up with her Variety's Power of Women event on Friday. "I think they'll have a tough time finding us over there in Morocco, won't they?"Kidman did admit she still isn't officially attached to the project. "It's not all signed, sealed and delivered," she said. "But…it's certainly in rapid sort of motion."

E! News was the first to tell you that Watts was stepping away from the Werner Herzog-directed film."It's still a way's off," she told us back in January 2012 at the Sundance Film Festival. "I don't know yet. Hopefully, it will happen. I just can't travel again right now because I did a lot of traveling last year. It's been a big year and it's time for me to be home with the kids."Pattinson is to play British Army officer T.A. Lawrence. Earlier this year, James Franco replaced Jude Law as the male led of the movie, British diplomat Henry Cadogan.

Kidman was honored by Variety for her work with the United Nations on women's rights.She said her mom first introduced her to fighting for women's equality."I've traveled all over the world and I feel I never do enough," Kidman said. "So I'm always pushing myself to do more, because it truly is something that can be changed."Check out more of our chat with Nicole in the video below.

Jennifer Lawrence and Harvey Weinstein -- Showdown with Famed Director David O. Russell/nFamed director David O. Russell went on a tear against Jennifer Lawrence and Harvey Weinstein during the filming of the movie  "Joy " ... this according to an eyewitness on the set. We're told there was a loud argument Tuesday on the Boston set between David and Jennifer, and it started over a scene. The eyewitness says David started screaming at her ... it was ear-piercing and laced with profanities.    A rep for the movie's studio -- Fox 2000 -- tells us yes, there was screaming, but it was all method acting. David was just getting J. Law amped-up for a scene in which she screams at someone.  But it doesn't end there. We're also told Miramax honcho Harvey Weinstein showed up on the set Wednesday to say hi to Jennifer, but David ordered him to leave. Harvey got as far as the makeup trailer before getting booted.  The studio rep says Harvey was told Tuesday things were moving at warp speed and his visit would be a distraction, but he showed up anyway ... unannounced.  And the eyewitness tells us a major exec for Fox was reamed out by David because she was trying to defend the line producer who David wants to fire. The eyewitness says it got so bad the exec started crying. The studio rep says that's ridiculous ... there was a  "heated " argument over the line producer, but she didn't cry. You may recall David's nuclear argument with Lily Tomlin during filming of  "I Heart Huckabees. " /n

Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner Talks Surviving 'Puberty & Hormones' While Growing Up on the Show
/n

 
Going though puberty is tough enough for most teens, but doing so in front of 25 million viewers makes it all the more challenging.
Just ask Sophie Turner, who was cast as Sansa Stark on Games of Thrones at age 12. Now at age 21, she reflects back on what it was like to go from young teen to an adult in front of the camera.
“That’s definitely been tricky to deal with — you’re growing up, and hormones and puberty and everything’s kind of hitting you all at once,” she tells PEOPLE.
But like her character, the young star has definitely matured over the past nine years, and Turner says she and Sansa have both been on an epic journey.
“We’ve been through so much together,” she says. “Everything that’s happened makes her who she is today. I can relate.”

 
Today, Turner is a bona fide fashionista, sitting front row at Louis Vuitton shows in Paris, party-hopping at the Golden Globes and turning heads in a lavish gown at the Met Gala in New York. She’s also landed her first major film role as Jean Grey in the upcoming X-Men: Dark Phoenix.
She’s also found happiness in her personal life and has been dating singer Joe Jonas, 27, since last November.

For more on Sophie Turner and Game of Thrones, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday


And as the show that made her a star comes to an end, Turner says she is grateful for the role of a lifetime.
“I’m so thankful to have gotten this job so early on,” she says. “It was the best drama class I could have ever asked for. A real gift.”
Game of Thrones airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on HBO.

It should be known that Chelsea did NOT see this as a debate — and watching her the whole time, it was clear she treated this as an interview that she really just didn't need — but Tomi really, really needed this night as she's still searching for a home after being apparently fired by Glenn Beck. 
No matter, though — a lot of what Tomi said was pretty incoherent (below):

Tomi almost seemed… nervous, talking very, VERY fast all night long. Don't really know why, she's been on big stages before — but she seemed super stressed while, again, Chelsea was kind of over it. 
But again… Tomi is still looking for a job (below) while Chelsea is KILLING IT on Netflix:

It's not that Tomi lost the "debate" on her ideas — if you're a Democrat, you'll side with Chelsea; if you're a Republican, you'll side with Tomi — it's that the more Tomi Lahren comes out into the forefront the more we see she doesn't know as much as she should know to actually take part in political discussions at this level.
Poor Tomes.

As Radar readers know, the Oscars finished out with the insane flub, when the award for Best Picture was handed to the wrong film, La La Land, after Beatty and Dunaway were given the incorrect envelope.
A report from Jeffrey Fleishman backstage revealed the jaw-dropping moment when workers backstage realized the mistake, with one stage hand even blurting out: “Oh, f**k. Oh my God. He got the wrong envelope.”

In fact, Fred Berger was still in the middle of speaking when fellow producer Jordan Horowitz cut in to announce that Moonlight had won.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that counts the Oscar ballots, later issued an apology statement that seemed to take the blame for the whole ordeal.

Russell Westbrook Nabs No. 1 Spot on Sports Illustrated’s Fashionable 50 List
/n

Polka dot wide-leg pants paired with a matching top. Drawstring forest green pants. Unbuttoned silk shirts. Bleached-out denim tops. Head-to-toe camouflage. Black jeans with plaid knee patches. If there’s a crazy trend, Russell Westbrook has tried it — and it’s the Oklahoma Thunder guard’s ambitious, audacious, signature #whynot style that has earned this NBA MVP his newest honor, the top spot in Sports Illustrated’s second annual Fashionable 50 List.
Westbrook’s new triumph as the most fashionable athlete of the year is a title the 28-year-old Long Beach, California native is proud to take on. He does call himself the Fashion King, after all. 
“I wear a combination of everything,” he says of his approach to style. “I go with what I’m feeling and with what looks good, regardless of how much it is. I want to show people across the world that you don’t always have to wear high-end. Whatever it is, you can still be fashionable.”

When he learned of the accolade, he was thrilled. “It’s definitely an unbelievable blessing,” he said at the Sports Illustrated Fashionable 50 celebration in Los Angeles, adding that it honors one of the things he loves most about being an athlete. “Fashion is an unbelievable platform for athletes all across the world, to be able to express themselves in different ways.”

The list, which is available online now and is this week’s Sports Illustrated cover story, was developed by the team at SI and a panel of experts, including former NBA player Walt Clyde Frazier, athlete stylist Brandon Williams, yours truly, People deputy style director Sharon Kanter, and more.

One of the reasons he’s number one is because of the fashion shows he so deliberately stages on his way to games. It’s like he’s on his own runway, except the runway is the trenches of an arena. He truly sees fashion everywhere. (See below for proof.)

Reign's Adelaide Kane on the Midseason Finale: "Someone Will Die and It Sucks!" Plus, Love Triangle Scoop  "Don't wear mascara. Ice cream, bottle of wine, you'll be good." That's what star Adelaide Kan.../n
 "Don't wear mascara. Ice cream, bottle of wine, you'll be good."That's what star Adelaide Kane advises fans to do in preparation of Reign's midseason finale, airing tonight on the CW.The episode is sure to shock fans of the breakout series as Kane reveals, "Somebody will truly die." And it's" someone very close" to the young Queen."Mary loses a confidant, someone that she loves a lot, and that loss will definitely taint the proceedings over the next few episodes," she says, "and that's a loss in her mind and it sobers her and the rest of her girls and they become more adult and more in tune to the harsh realities of their world, and adds a lot more weight to their decisions."

And Kane admits she's not happy about the death. "It just sucks. It's the worst, it's the worst. I'm going to cry at this next episode. It's so awful. I'm not looking forward to it. I am, because there are some incredible performances in this, but I'm not because no, I don't want to see it. I get so attached to the characters and the story that it just sucks."And impending death isn't the only drama going down in the castle after Mary learns of the prophecy that says Francis (Toby Regbo) will die if they actually get married. (And you thought not hearing back from a guy after sending him a text was rough.)"It's a choice between duty or love, in the case that she loves this man, she loves him with all of her heart, and naturally she wants to be with him, but at the same time, she wants to save his life," Kane previews of Mary's "difficult decision" in the episode. "So does she marry him—knowing that she'll be the cause of his death—for her country, and get the man that she wants even for a short time, or does she potentially find some other option and sacrifice not only the alliance but her reputation and her country's reputation and holding the alliance, and save the man the man she loves, to save his life."While "the last episode ended on a very ‘Frary' note," Kane says the love triangle between the couple and Bash (Torrance Coombs) is far from over.

"Don't start counting your chickens before they've hatched, that's all I'll say. Just when it seems good for those [Francis and Mary], it all goes down the toilet and just when it's all down the toilet, it gets good for them again," she teases. "There's a lot more back and forth things coming up."And Bash fans will be happy to hear Kane tease, "You will see it get a little bit more romantic" between Francis' half-brother and Mary."But the question is whether it's driven by Mary or Bash. Because is it so easy to forget your first love?" she explains. "I don't know if it is, but maybe the connection that she has with Bash is too strong. They're incredibly comfortable around each other, and that's always a warning sign. It's easy to fall for someone you feel completely comfortable with."Reign's midseason finale airs tonight at 9 p.m. on the CW.

George & Amal Clooney Welcome Twins Ella & Alexander/n
George and Amal Clooney have officially become parents! The couple welcomed twins, a boy and a girl, on Tuesday, Radar can confirm.
“This morning Amal and George welcomed Ella and Alexander Clooney into their lives. Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the proud papa told Radar.  He then joked: “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”
As Radar reported, the couple had been happily hiding out in their lavish British estate as they awaited the double arrival.

“George isn’t planning on traveling anywhere now that the due date is so close,” a source told Radar last month. “Amal could give birth early. George doesn’t want to miss anything.”
And the new parents spared no expense to ensure they had a healthy delivery, dropping over a million dollars to provide the best doctors and experience possible.
Sources say that included reserving an entire hospital wing, flying in a masseuse from Italy and even booking the British royals’ baby nurse!

Of course, as Radar revealed, the sex of the babies comes as no surprise. George’s own mother, Nina, revealed what the happy couple would have back in March.
“It will be one of each! Yes, a boy and a girl. That’s what I’ve been told,” Nina Clooney, 77, told Radar from her home in Augusta, Kentucky. “How marvelous! My husband and I are extremely excited.”
Congratulations to the happy couple!

Joan's Tragic Secret — New Tell-All Reveals Rivers' MULTIPLE Suicide Attempts!/n
Joan Rivers made the world laugh with her caustic wit, but a new tell-all book obtained by RadarOnline.com claims that she was secretly tortured by her tumultuous love life — and even attempted suicide TWICE over broken relationships!
Last Girl Before Freeway, by Vanity Fair author Leslie Bennetts, describes one early incident when Rivers’s behavior almost landed her in the mental hospital.
According to Bennetts, Rivers threatened to jump out a window during a screaming fight with her boyfriend, actor Nick Clemente, who she dated in the late 1950s.
PHOTOS: 10 Celebs Whose Plastic Surgery Almost Killed Them!
Alerted to her threats, her father Dr. Meyer Molinsky, “charged up to Joan’s room and started trying to wrestle her back down the stairs as Joan clung to the railing in her bathrobe, screaming and crying hysterically,” Bennetts writes.
“Dr Molinsky finally halted Joan’s resistance by announcing that she had two choices : come home to Larchmont at once or he would commit her to Bellevue [mental hospital] that very night.”
According to Bennetts, “The crisis left Joan feeling defeated; she saw her father as having won and his threat to have her committed to Bellevue as a powerful weapon that transformed him from a parent into a policeman. From then on, she tried to avoid him as much as possible.”
PHOTOS: Facelifts! Botox! Stars With Freaky Faces After Botched Plastic Surgery Procedures
Sadly, Bennetts claims, that was not the last time Rivers considered suicide before her death in 2014 after a surgery gone wrong.
In 1987, she was plunged into dark thoughts again when her second husband, Edgar Rosenberg, committed suicide by overdose. And Bennetts says Rivers weighed taking a similar way out.
“She sat on the bed, the gun in her lap,” writes Bennetts. “Everything seemed hopeless. ‘What’s the point,’ she thought. She couldn’t think of one…”
PHOTOS: Facelifts! Botox! Stars With Freaky Faces After Botched Plastic Surgery Procedures
“‘This is stupid,’ she thought. And then her Yorkshire terrier jumped onto her lap and sat on the gun…” Bennetts continues. “A terrible thought occurred to her. If she killed herself, what would happen to Spike? …Rivers claimed that Spike saved her life when he sat on her gun.”

Prince Harry Takes Meghan Markle On African Safari For Her 36th Birthday/n
Prince Harry was the picture of the romantic royal as he took his Suits star girlfriend Meghan Markle on an African safari for her 36th birthday on August 4. And insiders expect the Prince, 32, might get down on one knee during the vacation!
In fact, rumors are running wild that Harry could be planning to propose to Markle,  as The Sun reported. The two looked extremely close as they boarded an airplane en route to their African lovefest.
Harry and the actress were casually dressed as they walked across the runway to get into the jet. Both hid under baseball caps and Markle displayed her slim body in super casual skinny jeans.

Markle was holding what insiders believe was a present from her boyfriend that looked like a large picture frame. Could it be a framed photograph of the two of them to mark their love?
The pair arrived in Africa on Saturday as Harry wanted to do something special to help Markle celebrated turning 36.
Africa holds a special place in the hearts of the British royals. Harry’s brother, Prince William, asked Kate Middleton to marry him there in 2010 as they stayed in a log cabin in Kenya.

And it’s been a favorite destination for Harry, as he previously took his former girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, on African vacations.
But Harry is now in his 30s and he and Markle have been together for months, stoking engagement talk.
However, the playboy prince was also seen flirting with a hot mystery blonde in London this summer, as Radar has reported.

Still, Harry only had eyes for Markel this weekend.
He gave a cheerful thumbs’ up to other passengers as he put his arm around Markle at the airport tarmac.
The lovers don’t let distance and their jet-setting schedule keep them apart. The actress recently finished filming the last episode of her TV Suits season; she arrived in London from her home in Toronto where she was reunited with the Prince, who had recently been in Sicily.
PHOTOS: Prince William Taking Paternity Leave And 24 Other Things You Didn’t Know About The Royal Birth
The Prince is passionately involved in helping endangered el­e­phants and black rhinos in Africa — and sources think a proposal could happen as he’s sharing his interests with Markle.
A royal source revealed to The Sun that “Harry has been planning this holiday for a long time.
“Who knows what will happen when they’re watching a sensational African sunset together? Maybe he’ll get down on one knee.”
PHOTOS: Prince Andrew’s ‘Sex Slave,’ Virginia Roberts, Flashes Brave Grin
But as Radar has reported, there could be some royal red tape. Harry needs the Queen’s approval to propose to Markle and the star hasn’t yet met Her Majesty.
The source said, “Harry’s done a lot of conservation work in Africa with endangered el­e­phants and black rhinos and he’ll show them to the woman he wants to marry.
“He’s made the trip incredibly romantic. They’ll go on boats across the lake, walk in the bush at dawn and camp under the stars.”
Harry and Markle both seem to love traveling to exotic spots. Earlier this year, they went to Jamaica together for the wedding of a friend of the Prince.
Princes William and Harry have been emotional lately as they’ve remembered their late mother, Princess Diana, to mark the 20th anniversary of her death on August 31.

 Shocking Development: John Stamos Was Under Influence Of GHB In Beverly Hills DUI, Authorities.../n
Officials believe that John Stamos was under the influence of GHB in his DUI this past June in Beverly Hills, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The 51-year-old, according to online reports, was not using the substance to get high, but as a complement to his fitness routine to “lean out body mass,” as the drug is a favorite of competitive bodybuilders. The actor was so impacted by the drug that officials whisked him to the hospital after taking him into custody.
As a result, a criminal case is expected to be in the offing, with the actor facing charges of driving under the influence of GHB, according to online reports.

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone don’t just have each other’s backs on screen.
Stallone wished his friend and costar an early “happy birthday” on social media — along with some throwback photos. Schwarzenegger will turn 70 on Sunday, July 30.
The Rocky star shared side-by-side images of a young body-building Schwarzenegger in workout gear and Stallone in his Rambo costume in what appears to be his famous 1982 film First Blood. He wrote, “Pre – HAPPY BIRTHDAY ARNOLD!!!! As long as you live and beyond, you’re always going to be the “BIG MAN ” Who set the bar so high that it will never be surpassed, an action hero legend!

‘Gilmore Girls’ Creator Explains the Meaning of Those Last Four Words/n





                    'Gilmore Girls' Matt Czuchry Knows the Answer to the Revival's Biggest Cliffhanger
                







Matt Czuchry, who plays Rory's on-again, off-again boyfriend Logan Huntzberger, knows who Rory's baby father is.

 MORE >>





Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, Gilmore co-executive producer Daniel Palladino, are making the rounds to discuss Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, specifically the short conversation Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) have at the very end.
For those who don’t know, here’s how it ended: “Mom,” Rory says to Lorelai as they sit on the steps of the Stars Hollow gazebo. “Yeah?” Lorelai asks. Rory turns to face her mother. “I’m pregnant,” she says. Then the screen cuts to black. Aaarrggghh!
Naturally, the internet exploded after the revival premiered last Friday (Nov. 29, 2016). Is it Logan’s (Matt Czuchry) baby (apparently Czuchry knows the truth), and how will it affect their relationship? And what about Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), who seems to clearly still love Rory?

Amy told Vulture, “We didn’t really know what that last season was until we got into it and then we asked a lot of questions and we found out where the show ended. The show could have ended in a different place that made those last four words completely irrelevant. So we went into breaking this in a way that we were really looking at it like these three women are at a crossroads. The patriarch has died and what’s the way forward for them?”
She explains that they could have ended the original series with the same four words, but it was more interesting to have Rory be pregnant at the same age Lorelei was when we first met her. “That’s just an interesting kind of dynamic. When we met Lorelai, she was 32 and that’s where she was in her life and now we’re leaving Rory at 32 with the thing on the horizon. It felt kind of cooler to us to do it now than if we had done it when we were still on the WB.”
The Palladinos also spoke with BuzzFeed about the ending and said it wouldn’t out the realm of possibilities for Rory not to keep the baby. “The abortion issue is so weird, you know, because it’s so testy with the world, especially the KKK world that we now live in. But I think that somebody as smart as Rory is going to take a step back and look at all the angles, and then make her decision, because it’s too important a job to make the wrong decision when it comes to kids.”
The bigger question, however, is front and center: Does this mean they are setting things up for another Gilmore Girls go-around? “Nope, not at all,” Sherman-Palladino told Vulture. “We’ve always tried to not wrap things up in a bow. We tried to do that on the series. Because life isn’t like that. You can have a good moment with a parent you are estranged from, and you have a great moment, and then the next time you see them, everything’s back to the way it was before and you guys are throwing knives at each other. Life doesn’t tend to fix things or wrap them up in bows. Because of that, we wanted the ending of this to not have a pat ‘And they all lived happily ever after!'” Sigh.

Double-Crossing Is Built into The Challenge XXX — Learn the Latest Twist (of the Knife) on Dirty Thirty
/n

It was only a matter of time until someone got “double-crossed” on The Challenge‘s sneakiest, most treacherous season yet.
In an exclusive sneak peek at Tuesday’s episode of the reality competition’s latest installment, XXX: Dirty Thirty, host TJ Lavin welcomes the Challengers to their first elimination in Colombia, so called The Presidio, and explains how the weekly fights for survival will work this season.
As with previous seasons, the competitors must draw blindly to determine who will face that week’s odd men out (in this case, house punching bag Cory Wharton and last-in-maybe-first-out new addition Briana LaCuesta). They could just draw one “cross” and remain in danger of going into the elimination battle — on the other hand if they draw a “double cross,” they are safe but have to name the player who will face potentially going home.
Asks Lavin, “I told you this game was dirty, didn’t I?”
FROM PEN: TV Revivals We Want to See

 
According to Battle of the Exes winner Camila Nakagawa, “It’s a whole other level of ‘Let’s stab each other in the back as many times as we can.’ This just got crazier — but I love it.”
Adds Battle of the Exes II champ Jordan Wiseley, “This aspect of the game is going to put so much pressure on people to be making backdoor deals and double-cross anyone they can to save their own skin.”
Find out who will be facing a double-edged sword (but not elimination) when The Challenge XXX: Dirty Thirty airs Tuesdays (9 p.m. ET) on MTV.

For Bachelor in Paradise alums Carly Waddell and Evan Bass, the news of their first child on the way together was potentially as much a surprise to them as it was to their fans.
During a chat with Entertainment Tonight Monday — the same day season 4 of BIP kicked off its two-night premiere — the newlyweds said they found out about Waddell’s pregnancy while in Mexico, right after their June wedding.
“It was a great surprise, it’s a great little miracle,” says Waddell, 31. “I was a little late … We took a pregnancy test in Mexico, and we saw the thing [in Spanish] and were like, ‘What does that even say?’ So we Googled it.”

The moment the parents-to-be saw the positive pregnancy test wasn’t caught on camera (“That was for us alone,” Waddell says, laughing), but they say they should know the sex of the baby very soon.
“We actually just took a blood test because we want to know really fast!” Waddell shares. “So we should know in the next like, week or two.”
“[We need] to start planning!” adds Bass, who is already dad to three sons from a previous relationship: Nathan, Liam and Ensley. “I mean, we got things to buy!”

“I think that’s so confusing. If I’m mad, and I’m like, ‘Evan!’ and then you both run in like, ‘What?’ that’s so confusing,” she explains.

Teresa Giudice Advised By Ex-Inmates Before Prison Entry, Lawyer Says/n
Before entering Danbury, Connecticut’s Federal Correctional Institution, Teresa Giudice received key advice from women who were recently let out of the facility, her attorney James J. Leonard Jr. told ABC News Monday.
Leonard said the former prisoners told the troubled reality star “to keep her head up” and “that she would make it through” the tough times — a refreshing dose of reality in the wake of weeks of denial on the reality star’s part.

Giudice was cautioned to behave “friendly but guarded” at the facility, which inspired the hit show Orange Is The New Black and has past housed other prominent inmates, including singer Lauryn Hill and the late Leona Helmsley.
The ex-inmates also told Giudice to savor the moments she spent with her family. She will be permitted to meet with them this weekend, her lawyer said.

The lawyer said Giudice “was anxious to get in” and begin her sentence so she could “get this thing started, get it behind her, and get back to her family.
“Her four girls are her primary focus,” Leonard said.

Yesterday was a dark, dark day in our nation's history: Venerable teen store Delia's sold its last spaghetti strap tank top.Never again will young girls feel the joy of rushing home to check the mailbox for the latest catalog. Never again will they be able to decorate their bedrooms with a headache-inducing theme of moons and stars, palm trees, or hot pink zebra stripes. Never again will they sit alone in front of the mirror, rubbing on glitter sticks until they develop a full-body rash. 

It's truly heartbreaking to imagine a world without Delia's (or, rather, dELiA*s). But, that is our new reality. The company shuttered yesterday, after a long period of financial hardship. According to a report last year by CNN Money, Delia's planned on filing for bankruptcy as well as liquidating its entire stock (both brick-and-mortar stores and the catalog), and now it's finally happened. Dedicated fans were given the opportunity to cash in on the folding by scooping up the remaining products for basically 100% off, but those of us who were slower on hearing the news will have to take solace simply in memories. In light of these tragic events, we'd like to take a moment to look back on a few of our favorite forgotton items from the now-defunct brand. 

The Inflatable Chair: The inflatable chair meant a lot of things to us. It meant never having to worry about spills. It meant being able to deflate our chairs and carry them with us wherever we went. It meant being able to buy "furniture" for less than the price of a pair of socks. But mostly, it meant always having a pair of squeaky, sticky arms to welcome us home.The Graphic Tee: These were the single greatest form of self-expression available to a 13-year-old. Do you want everyone at school to know that you heart Hanson? Do you want your parents to know that you choose pugs not drugs? Do you want to pretend that you're with the band? Put it on a graphic tee.The Spaghetti Strap Tank: What better way to dress scandalously, while still making it past your parents' scrutiny, than the spaghetti strap tank. They were flattering on no one, but we loved them just the same. Roll-On Body Glitter: This was the makeup that turned middle school classrooms into 1970s discos. You could roll it here, you could roll it there, you could roll it everywhere! But mostly you could roll it all over your arms, chest, and face, until even the slightest reflection of light caused blindness in whoever was standing across from you.The Tiny Knapsack: Only a tween could find a use for a knapsack so tiny it fit literally nothing, and slung so low it doubled as a buttcrack coverup. Goodbye, tiny knapsack full of big dreams, we'll miss you most of all.

Lil Wayne Will Sue Martin Shkreli If 'Carter 5' Leaks Again/nLil Wayne is demanding Martin Shkreli hand over his copy of  "Tha Carter V " and says if the infamous disgraced pharma exec leaks anymore of it online ... he's taking his ass to court. We're told Weezy's lawyers and Universal Music both fired off cease and desist letters after Shkreli leaked more tunes earlier this month from the stupidly long-awaited album. He first played the record on the Internet around Christmas, but Wayne didn't sue because Shkreli gave his word he wouldn't do it again. That word lasted 5 months. As we reported, Shkreli leaked 2 more during a livestream. One of the tracks features Kendrick Lamar. Sources close to Wayne tell us they think Shkreli's just doing it for attention, but now he's on notice ... the next time WILL earn him a big fat lawsuit./n

Arnold Schwarzenegger Dropped $65,000 on Baby Mama Mildred Patricia Baena's House/nArnold Schwarzenegger made a $65,000 down payment on a house for his ex-housekeeper Mildred Patricia Baena -- less than a year before he admitted to fathering her child ... TMZ has learned.According to loan documents obtained by TMZ, Arnold made the  "gift " payments in two installments from his own personal bank account -- one for $5,000 in April 2010 ... and one for $60,000 in May 2010.According to the docs, the money was used to secure a loan for Patty's house in Bakersfield, CA -- where she currently lives with Arnold's 13-year-old love child.The purchase price of the house was $268,000 -- so Arnold's down payment covered nearly a quarter of the total cost.It's unclear if Maria was aware of the transaction at the time./n

The Hollywood Reporter

Leah Remini will not hold back when it comes to spilling her truth about the Church of Scientology.Not only has she written a book, but she also has a show on A&E called Scientology and the Aftermath, which she says is dedicated to revealing how the church is tearing families apart.She sat down with fellow reality show veterans Kris Jenner, RuPaul, W. Kamau Bell and SallyAnn Salsano for The Hollywood Reporter's reality TV roundtable and openly discussed her passion for taking down the Church of Scientology."The Church of Scientology has been in the news, but more so for fodder and a headline," she began. "What we are trying to do is show that this is a real thing that's tearing families apart. People really had no idea."

She continued, "It was like, 'Oh, this is that crazy thing where Tom Cruise is jumping on a couch and everybody believes in aliens?' I think that worked for a very long time to sell headlines. But we're showing how a person actually can get there, and that's what's resonating. Also, we're standing up to a bully and, in a culture where people are feeling apathetic, we're representing a group of courageous people who are saying, 'No, I'm going to do something about it.'"

Of course, many managers and people around Remini tried to convince her to step away from the topic, but she refused."Everybody on my team told me not to. They want me to be an actress," she revealed. "They don't want me to be known as somebody who does a show about Scientology. I'm like, 'What am I going to do? Not do it? This is my passion.'"In fact, she hands her personal cell phone number out to everyone who comes on the show, answering their every text and call.

"It's not me, that's the thing...I'm telling their stories," she explained. "When we leave, they go back to their regular lives, and they are the ones the church goes after. When we air a show, I go, 'Just know, within minutes your daughter is going to be saying horrific things about you on the church hate website.' Literally every single person who has done a story about Scientology has a hate website on them."But that doesn't mean she's afraid."Don't misunderstand me," she explained. "People who know me know that I have a very big mouth, and I have been that way since I was a kid...But I never want to give the organization of Scientology the idea that anybody is scared of them. We are not. And the more they react in the way that they do, it makes me think we're doing the right thing."

A spokesperson for the Church of Scientology referred us to this website for any statements regarding Remini.Read more about Remini and the other reality stars on THR.

The reality TV couple fought over their tots since their 2016 split, and Dennis accused Ravenel of dating his nanny’s teenage daughter during the battle.
She also claimed he “encouraged the underage drinking of the nanny’s daughter [redacted] in front of the children” and used mushrooms and cocaine in front of the children.
Dennis alleged that he “encouraged” their children to call their nanny “mother” and told them to call her “’Kathryn’ instead of ‘mommy’” as well, and that the nanny kicked her out of her son’s christening reception on April 16.

Christina Aguilera Takes Emotional Trip to Rwanda/n

Christina Aguilera knew visiting Rwanda would be eye-opening. But it wasn’t until she spent time in Kigali, Rwanda, on a hunger relief mission this June – visiting refugee camps and seeing the severe poverty firsthand – that she discovered just how profoundly moving the experience would be.  
“This trip came at a time when I really needed to step away and connect with bigger issues in the world, [and] this trip really touched me in a way I never felt before,” says Aguilera, who is the global spokesperson for Yum! Brands World Hunger Relief effort and an Ambassador Against Hunger for the UN World Food Programme.  
“I came home and really wondered about why some people are born to some situations and others are born in a different place,” The Voice star tells PEOPLE. “I had to come to terms with a little guilt even for coming home and not doing more. The people of Rwanda touched me in a way I cannot express or put into words. They are in a place that needs our help and I am so proud of the work that we are doing there.” 
The time she spent with hundreds of Rwandan children during the trip was especially poignant for the Aguilera, who couldn’t help but think of her 5-year-old, Max.  
“After the birth of my son, I started looking into causes that touched me as a mother and I was so moved by the work the World Food Programme and Yum! did,” says Aguilera, who has also visited Haiti and Guatemala on behalf of the group.  
“As a mom, to know that there are kids that go to bed hungry is just not acceptable. Food is a human right in my mind and knowing that I can help means so much. In Rwanda, we visited a school. The kids walk approximately two miles to get there, not only to learn but for many this is their only meal of the day.”  
RELATED: Christina Aguilera Writes Long Love Letter to Fans
Even with her busy career and hectic life as a working mom, Aguilera has no plans to stop trying to help fight world hunger. Almost as soon as she returned home from Rwanda, she was sure of one thing: “I know I will go back.”

Jay Z's Team Slammed For Alleged Love Child Cover-Up — Will Beyonce Stand By Him?/n
Jay Z‘s legal team has just been delivered a shocking blow in the heated battle over rumors he fathered a love child, RadarOnline.com has learned. Will this be the last straw for his marriage to Beyonce?
Radar has obtained an exclusive letter the President of the Families Civil Liberties Union, Gregory T. Roberts, wrote to the 46-year-rap mogul’s legal defense team. Roberts slams the rapper’s attorneys for not forcing him to take a DNA test proving whether he fathered a secret son, Rymir Satterthwaite.
Roberts wrote, “If Jay Z is innocent, I’m curious why you don’t advise him to take the paternity test rather than create false battles and artificial conflict with an upstanding not-for-profit. I have been 100% cooperative with you.”
“In turn, you seem determined to create a frivolous legal blizzard of subpoenas in a futile attempt to find some hidden treasure trove of information that we don’t have.”

“This case … appears to involve a politically connected law firm that leverages the legal system as a sword and, through cozy relations with judges and politicians, receives a sweetheart deal that denies the legal rights of others,” Roberts alleged.
As Radar was the first to report, Jay Z has been dodging having to take a paternity test brought on by Satterthwaite, guardian Lillie Collie and the now-22-year-old’s mother Wanda, who is said to have dated the rapper over two decades ago.

Last week, the FCLU championed the case in hopes of proving that Jay Z’s legal team not only worked in collusion with the local court system, but also violated their 14th amendment rights.
Robert concluded, “Like Beyonce, who stands against police officers who overstep their power, we stand against lawyers who seek an unfair advantage with friendly judges and legally abuse adversaries seeking fairness in the judicial system. Only you can know if you fall into that category. If you do think you are in that category, we (of course) would hate to find Jay-Z falling victim to a predatory lawyer using him for his money.”
The case – which started in 2010 – is currently in the federal court system and under FBI investigation.

When Kellyanne Conway wore a $3,600 red, white and blue Gucci coat to Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, it created a frenzy on the internet and sparked hundreds of memes about the patriotic garb. So, what does the former campaign manager think now that it’s become a viral sensation — or joke, depending how you want to look at it — around the world?

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the 50-year-old defends the look, saying that she’s “sorry to offend the black-stretch-pants women of America with a little color.”
She also takes aim at “the public cesspool that is Twitter” and liberal media, claiming that many of the opposition are actually very solicitous in private. Calling out one publication in particular, Conway says, “The Huffington Post constantly slams me, but Howard Fineman [HuffPo’s lead political reporter] calls to check on how I’m doing figuring out Washington schools.”

“I am just trying to stand up to the cacophony, sameness and myopia of the media world,” she explains of her attitude.
Conway also isn’t going to stop appearing on TV any time soon. Though she was — and still is — dragged by the public for her “alternative facts” remark, the trusted advisor to the POTUS says she’s always ready to step in front of the camera, “taking many other people’s TV time.”
“I can put my shoes and panty hose back on and go on any show at any time,” she says, noting the recent social media campaign for programs to boycott of her as a guest. “If you see me on TV, it’s because [Trump] wants me there.”

Surprising Secrets Of 'The Andy Griffith Show'/n
Evoking nostalgia for a simpler time, The Andy Griffith Show was a smash hit in the turbulent ’60s. Andy Griffith portrayed one of TV’s most beloved fathers, widowed sheriff Andy Taylor, who was raising young son Opie — played by future “Happy Days” star Ron Howard — in the idyllic small town of Mayberry.
Featuring a cast of eccentric characters, including bumbling deputy Barney Fife (Don Knotts) and Andy’s housekeeping Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier), the iconic sitcom ran for eight seasons.
Here are some of the wild secrets behind the classic series.
PHOTOS: Broke, ‘Suicidal’ & More! 10 Dark Secrets Of The ‘Flip Or Flop’ Split
“The Andy Griffith Show” wasn’t the first time Andy and Don worked together! The pair starred in the 1958 film “No Time for Sergeants,” which was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. Andy was even at Don’s side when he died at age 81 in 2006.
Don showed up to work on the first day of filming without a contract. But producers were so impressed by the chemistry between Andy and Don that they gave him a one-year deal on the spot that was eventually extended by another five!
“The second episode was called ‘Manhunt,'” recalled Andy, who died in 2012, “and I knew by that episode Don should be the comic and I should play straight for him. That made all the difference.”‘

The squad car used by Andy and Barney was a Ford Galaxie, and a local dealership provided a replacement every time a new model was released. Ten vehicles were used during the show’s run.
Although Andy portrayed a kind-hearted hero on the show, in real life he had some of his co-stars shaking in their boots!
He had a reputation as being mean when he got drunk, which was often, and at least once he trashed a hotel room.

“Friends winced at the thought of spending an evening in the Griffith home,” says Daniel de Visé author of the book “Andy & Don.”
George Lindsey, who played the goofy car mechanic cousin of Jim Nabors‘ Gomer Pyle on the show from 1964 to 1968, noted his nasty feuds with Andy in his 1995 memoir “Goober in a Nutshell.”
“Every Monday night, he would call you if he liked your performance,” recalled Lindsey, who died in 2012. “If the call didn’t come, I dreaded going back to work on Tuesday morning.”
But when Andy was in better spirits, he loved to tease his good friend, Don. Don’s birth name was “Jesse,” and he hated it — which made Andy frequently call him “Jess” on set!

However, the cast doled out their own sort of pranks, with one catching Andy in a compromising position! When a crew member dressed as a waiter to deliver dinner to Andy’s hotel room, he caught the actor with co-star Aneta Corsaut, with whom he was rumored to be having an affair.
The memorable opening clip, with the show’s whistled theme song, was filmed at Franklin Canyon Park, which is located at the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains in L.A.
Ron Howard was only 6 when the credit sequence was filmed and wasn’t strong enough to toss the rock into the lake. A props master was finally tapped to fling the stone into the water, creating an odd lag between the boy’s toss and the rock’s splash.
The show went out on top! The sitcom led all others in the Nielsen ratings during its final season. It was only one of three series in TV history to do so, the others being “I Love Lucy” and “Seinfeld.”

Grammys: Janet, Justin In; Luther Out/n
              The Grammy RSVPs are in and it looks like the boobylicious Super Bowl tandem of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake are still on the guest list, but Luther Vandross will be MIA.                            More on Luther in a bit, first let's talk Justin and Janet.                            The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the group behind the Grammys, told E! Tuesday that "as of right now, Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake are still on the Grammys.                            "If we took everyone who is controversial off the show, no one would perform."                            The remark came in the wake of CBS affiliates asking the network to broadcast Sunday's Grammy Awards on a slight delay in case of any language slips or wardrobe malfunctions.                             CBS, of course, broadcast the Super Bowl halftime show that featured Jackson's brazier-bursting duet with Timberlake on "Rock Your Body." The Boobgate incident sparked thousands of complaints from viewers and an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission, whose chairman called it an outrage and promised heavy fines for those responsible, namely CBS and MTV, which produced the halftime show.                              The New York Post reports that CBS could still eject the two singers from the Grammy telecast should the network learn that Jackson and Timberlake conspired to reveal her pierced nipple to the world.                            MTV and CBS immediately issued statements saying the stunt was unplanned and accidental. Jackson has admitted that she and Timberlake concocted the stunt on their own, and he was only supposed to rip off only the upper layer of her vinyl dominatrix get-up, revealing a red bra underneath. Timberlake called it a "wardrobe malfunction," and Jackson, said, "It was not my intention that it go as far as it did."                           "We were really ripped off. We were punk'd by Janet Jackson," MTV CEO Tom Freston said Tuesday during a panel discussion with other media execs.                           The chances of Jackson's breast reprising its appearance at the Grammys are slim, however. Jackson is only slated to be a presenter at the Grammys. Timberlake will perform solo, which should cut down on the bodice-ripping potential.                            As for Vandross, the smooth-operating soulster, currently in physical rehab after being stricken by a near-fatal stroke last April, was hoping to recover in time to appear  at the show, where he's nominated for five awards,  including Album of the Year for Dance with My Father. But after consulting with physicians, Vandross decided that his health ultimately came first.                            "It would have been a tremendous moment for Luther to attend the Grammy Awards this year," business manager Carmen Romano said in a statement.  "But on the advice of his doctors, I regret to say that Luther won't be able to make this trip."                            The 52-year-old crooner was found unconscious in his Manhattan apartment on April 16, 2003. He had made tremendous strides in recent months, improving so much that he even has managed to sing a bit when pal Patti LaBelle visited him in the hospital, something Romano called a "modern-day miracle."                            Although he has been sidelined, Vandross has remained a vital musical force. Dance with My Father debuted atop the charts in June and won him two American Music Awards in November, which his mother, Mary, accepted on his behalf.                            Despite his absence, Vandross will definitely be at the Grammys in spirit. Show producers have recruited Alicia Keys, Celine Dion and Richard Marx for a Vandross tribute. The trio will perform two of the singer's greatest hits.

Bill Cosby Believes His Sexual Misconduct Allegations Might Be Fueled by Racism/n





                    Janice Dickinson Suing Bill Cosby for Defamation
                







'Justice and Vindication'

Bill Cosby shares what he believes to be the motives behind the sexual assault allegations that have brought against him.

Bill was a guest on Michael Smerconish’s Sirius XM show on Tuesday (May 16, 2017) and was asked about the outpour of sexual misconduct charges that allegedly occurred between him and a roster of women between 1965 and 2008. During his interview, he restated an argument that was proposed by his daughter, Ensa Cosby, in a statement to The Breakfast Club.
“I believe that racism has played a big role in all aspects of this scandal,” read the statement from his daughter. “The accusations against my father have been one-sided from the beginning. I’ve witnessed my father’s reputation and legendary works be dismissed without any proof…My father has been publicly lynched in the media.”
Bill’s other daughter Erinn Cosby added, “Over the last few years, my family has been forced to sit down and watch as our father has been attacked in the media. I love my father and always have and always will. I believe in his innocence and I know how he values me.”
When asked about this commentary, Bill agreed Ensa’s theory on racism playing a part in the allegations “could be” true.
“Could be. Could be. I can’t say anything, but there are certain things that I look at, and I apply to the situation, and there are so many tentacles. So many different—’nefarious’ is a great word,” Bill stated. “I just truly believe that some of it may very well be that.”
Smerconish noted that his accusers are of various races, to which Bill replied, “Let me put it to you this way: When you look at the power structure, and when you look at individuals, there are some people who can very well be motivated by whether or not they’re going to work. Or whether or not they might be able to get back at someone. So, if it’s in terms of whatever the choice is, I think that you can also examine individuals and situations and they will come out differently. So, it’s not all—not every—but I do think that there’s some.”

Though he claimed that he was not at liberty to speak openly about the allegations, Cosby made it clear that he will not testify against Andrea Constand, the first woman who went public with her sexual abuse allegations against him a decade ago.
“I’d like to be remembered for being the guy that they made give back all the things they rescinded,” Bill stated before Smerconish asked him to explain this statement.
“Well…things were…rescinded,” Bill continued. “And I’d like to get those things back, because the people who decided to make that decision then saw they made a mistake.”

Alexander ranked at No. 11 for boys in 2016, and Ella hit No. 17 for girls last year. Both have been among the top 10 over the years.
No immediate family members of either parent seem to have the Clooney twins’ names, but plenty of high-profile Americans share their forenames.

According to Behind the Name, Ella is a form of the German name Alia, while Alexander dates back to ancient Greece. Babycenter.com defines Ella’s meaning as “a short form of Eleanor and Ellen, meaning ‘light.’ It can also mean ‘beautiful fairy woman’ in English, and ‘all’ or ‘other’ in German.”
Alexander, as Babycenter.com defines, is Greek for “defender of men”: “Countless kings and emperors named Alexander have ruled since the time of the ancient Greeks.”

People vs. OJ Simpson -- Real D.A. Did Not Want Clark ... She Just Didn't Listen/nMarcia Clark's pigheadedness cost her the trial ... so claims the man who ran the office and regrets tapping her for the assignment. Gil Garcetti, who served as L.A. County D.A. during the trial, says the dialogue in the TV series is just made up and misleading.  He told the NY Post Clark would not listen to the jury consultants who warned her not to put African American women -- particularly mothers -- on the jury. It's well documented African American women felt Clark was  "a bitch, " but she refused to listen. Garcetti says he didn't want Clark as lead prosecutor, but she lobbied hard and the man he wanted was too ill to take the case. He feels she was completely outclassed by Johnnie Cochran and company.  He also says there's no doubt the verdict came down to race.  In the middle of the trial, he says former President Jimmy Carter told him OJ would be found not guilty and it was simply a case of  "payback.

THIS Is How Bachelor In Paradise Handled The Sexual Misconduct Elephant In The Room On The Season Premiere!/n

What a ride!
As we reported back in June, production on Bachelor in Paradise was temporarily suspended after cast mates Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson were suspected of being involved in alleged sexual misconduct.
After Warner Bros. conducted an investigation, the company found no evidence of wrongdoing, and production resumed WITHOUT Olympios and Jackson.
Related: Former Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis Got Married, In Case You Care
Fast forward to Monday, during the highly anticipated premiere of BiP, the show barely even addressed controversy — leaving us all waiting for more!
The end of last night's premiere ended with a huge tease of show-runners pulling Corinne and DeMario aside and shutting production down — but other than a few brief glances of the two messing around (fully clothed) in the pool, this definitely was not what we felt like was promised.
Here's a couple of things we did get: 
– Amanda Stanton returned her engagement ring from Josh Murray to Chris Harrison during her introduction. Get ready for more off-the-shoulder dresses.
– Dean Unglert and Kristina Schulman are early favorites to become BiP's next couple. They bonded on their first one-on-one date about their complicated families.
– Robby Hayes' hair is somehow bigger and more voluptuous than ever. Despite his valiant attempt, Raven Gates wasn't swooned by his groomed locks and spray-tanned bod.
– After a makeout sesh with Iggy Rogriguez, Lacey Mark had to leave the show early because her grandfather passed away.
– Wells Adams replaced the notorious Jorge as the bartender and announced he definitely is not in Paradise to date. Sadsies.
We guess we'll just have to tune in tonight to see if ABC ever comes through with that Corinne/DeMario footage! Stay tuned.

We'd give this surprise a 10!Dancing With the Stars judge Carrie Ann Inaba was filling in for Kelly Ripa Tuesday morning on LIVE With Kelly and Ryan when she decided to simultaneously shock her mother sitting in the audience. To get the surprise rolling, she first brought up a new story about a bride who asked her closest friends to bid for a spot as one of her bridesmaids and maid of honor.Inaba, who is also a bride-to-be, revealed that she is also in the process of picking her bridal party and is trying to figure out how to incorporate her different groups of friends. Fortunately for the former Fly Girl's mother, Patricia, she wouldn't have to vie for one of those top spots because her daughter already had a role in mind for her.

"I wanted to ask, Mom, would you be my matron of honor?" she said to her mother sitting in the audience. Inaba's mama was immediately overcome with emotion as she got teary-eyed in her seat. The mother and daughter embraced in the audience, but the star wanted to be sure that her mom was serious. "Was that a 'for real' yes or a 'TV' yes?" Inaba asked. "Are you going to tell me later...[grunt]?"From the look on her mom's face, it was clear that she accepted the title wholeheartedly. "Thank you, mom," the star told her. "I love you."

Inaba accepted a ring from her actor beau Robb Derringer back in December and, according to the future married lady, it was a night she will never forget.  "The ocean mist created an ambiance that was magical, and I will always remember the way that sky looked as Robb got down on one knee and asked me to be his wife," she told People. "All alone on that beautiful beach, it was as if time stood still and we were the only two people on earth. I will never forget it. It was perfect. Getting engaged where we had that perfect first date was really such poetic destiny."As the days tick down to her big day, Inaba can officially check "find a matron of honor" off her to-do list.

Saint Ralph/n
Cross Chariots of Fire with Billy Elliot and you've got some idea of what writer-director Michael McGowan is aiming for here. Fourteen-year-old Ralph (Adam Butcher, an immensely gifted newcomer) is having a bad time of it: His father was killed, his mother is dying of a brain tumor, and he's enrolled in a Catholic boys' school, circa 1953.

 Hello, repression! The benign troublemaker finds some redemptive value by joining the track team and naïvely linking his mother's recovery to his athletic success. And since this is one of those hopes-and-dreams-type movies, contemplative priest and cross-country coach Campbell Scott is touched by this willful boy's determination. Going beyond the never-say-die concept, McGowan paints an evocative picture of provincial life and mostly steers clear of cliché. And if the film's ending is predictable and drawn out, it's cathartic nonetheless and a welcome reminder that, yes, miracles can happen.

Rihanna Parties In London After Drake's Gig! Is This Veil Her Attempt At Going Incognito?/n

Rihanna's worn some interesting head gear over the years. And this one's not even the weirdest!
In fact, the red veiled visor she wore to party at the Tramp Club early this morning (following Drake's gig at O2 Arena in London) was one of many veiled pieces she's worn in the past — remember the veiled pink beanie?
Her black dress and embellished leather jacket were pretty low-key for RiRi's standards, but her little tiny Chanel bag was definitely an eye-catcher! Once you actually noticed it, that is.
The Bajan songstress has definitely been the one to pioneer this look, but we're not sure if it'll ever catch on.

Mel B’s Nanny Nightmare: Spice Girls Singer Sued Over Kinky Sex Secrets/n
Mel B is a kinky sex freak who “seduced” and then “discarded” her innocent nanny! That’s the claim of German woman Lorraine Gilles, who worked as a nanny for the Spice Girls singer and her now-ex-husband Stephen Belafonte, and is now suing her for defamation in an explosive lawsuit obtained by RadarOnline.com.
Mel B dragged Gilles into her nasty split from Belafonte earlier this month, claiming that the young woman and her estranged husband had carried on an affair that left Gilles pregnant – with a baby she eventually aborted.
But Gilles’ new suit tears apart the claims that she’s “a homewrecker, prostitute and extortionist.” In fact, she says, it was the singer who “seduced” her into a kinky “sexual relationship” that took over her life.
PHOTOS: Spice Girls Star Mel B Reconciles With Heartbroken Mom After A Decade-Long Feud
“Brown seduced a naïve and curious 18-year-old foreign exchange student with alcohol, fame and casual sex shortly after she arrived in the US in 2009,” the documents state.
They met when Brown was out to dinner with Belafonte in Hollywood, according to the documents, and lonely Gilles says she was thrilled to be invited to join them at their home for dinner. The evening quickly devolved into a night of “consensual” group sex, she claims.
After that, the documents allege, “Brown would contact Gilles from time to time invite Gilles to come over for drinks, sex, and/or to help watch her children. From the onset, Brown and Gilles developed a friendship and sexual relationship with one another that was separate and apart from Brown’s relationship with her husband. Brown explained to Gilles that she and her husband had an open relationship.”

Gilles returned to Germany for a short period, only to be contacted again by Brown asking her to be a nanny for the couple’s children, she claims in the lawsuit. And she remained their sex partner, too.
“The couple had sex sporadically, sometimes having sex multiple times in a week and at other times going months without sex,” she claims in the documents.
As for Belafonte, he “was not present during most of the sexual encounters,” she alleges.
PHOTOS: Larry King’s Horror: Cheating Wife’s Lover Revealed!
“The only times Gilles and Belafonte had sex was when Brown herself invited her husband to join the couple in the bedroom, at which point Brown would often serve as the ‘camera man’ and record the sexual encounter and/or take part in the menage a trois herself.” (Brown took out a restraining order against Gilles earlier this month, claiming she had copies of those tapes, but Gilles says she does not own them.)
What’s more, Gilles says she was not their only partner: “Gilles personally witnessed both Brown and Belafonte bring different women into their home and engage in group sex on multiple occasions, while Gilles tended to the children,” the lawsuit claims.
Through many ups and downs, Gilles says she was “ultimately terminated in September 2016, after finding herself caught in the middle of intensifying marital arguments between Brown and Belafonte.”

“Gilles was heartbroken and felt taken advantage of, having devoted years of her youth to serve Brown’s family, only to be discarded and tossed out on a whim…”

Prince's Alleged Niece Refusing To Take Court-Ordered DNA Test/n
As the fight over Prince‘s massive estate continues, Judge Kevin Eide ordered DNA testing for six of the potential heirs — but one of them has objected to comply!
As Radar previously reported, several people have claimed to be the musician’s long-lost relatives, including alleged niece, Brianna Nelson.
But according to Law Newz, Nelson’s lawyer, Jayne Sykora, requested that Brianna, the supposed daughter of Prince’s late half brother Duane Nelson, and her daughter Victoria, be exempt from the DNA tests.

“She claims that she is not basing her heirship on a genetic relationship to Prince or the terms of the Minnesota Parentage Act, which states that a man is presumed to be a child’s biological father if one of various conditions are met, like the child being born into his marriage to the mother,” the publication reported.
Instead, Nelson’s claims “are based upon the father-son relationship between John L. Nelson [Prince’s father] and Duane Nelson, and the sibling relationship between Decedent Prince Rogers Nelson and Duane Nelson,” Sykora argued in the court filing.

Meanwhile, Prince’s sister, Tyka Nelson, has taken the lead on handling the probate case.
In April, Tyka said in a court filing that Prince died without a will. She listed herself and five other siblings — John, Norrine, Sharon, Alfred and Omarr — as his legal heirs under Minnesota law. /n

Gabrielle Union isn't done being Mary Jane.The actress and BET have reached a settlement in Union's multimillion-dollar breach of contract lawsuit against the network. In October, Union and her lawyers claimed the cabler and Being Mary Jane's producers had reneged on an agreement to have a substantial break between the show's fourth and fifth seasons. According to Union's lawyers, BET and the producers ignored the deal to allow for production to run back-to-back, thereby cutting costs. Union said she and BET previously agreed to 13-episode maximum seasons to accommodate for her movie career.Series producer Breakdown Productions was also a defendant in the lawsuit. In October, the network promised it was "committed to reaching a swift and positive resolution" with Union.

In her filing, Union sought at least $3 million in general damages and a declaration that BET could not order more than 13 episodes for any season of Being Mary Jane. In a statement Tuesday, BET told E! News it was "pleased to announce that they have reached an amicable agreement with Gabrielle Union and look forward to sharing the new season of Being Mary Jane with its loyal fans beginning Jan. 10, 2017." The terms of Union's settlement are unknown.E! News has reached out to Union's reps for comment.

Being Mary Jane's season-four renewal was announced in January as part of the Television Critics Association's winter press tour. The pick-up news came as a bit of a surprise, considering that its creator and showrunner, Mara Brock Akil, exited as part of an overall deal she and her husband had signed with Warner Bros. in 2015. But the drama has been a strong performer for BET since it debuted as an original TV movie in 2013. In fact, every season of Being Mary Jane has ranked as the No. 1 scripted cable series among black viewers in the 18-49 demographic.(Originally published Dec 27, 2016 at 9:45 a.m. PST)

Well, we feel old.Today marks 17 years since the Parent Trap remake was released! Back in 1998, adorable redheaded identical twins Hallie Parker and Annie James, played by Lindsay Lohan, took over our movie screens!The two girls met as strangers at summer camp, but then realize something extraordinary: They are in fact twins that were separated at birth due to their parent's divorce. The dynamic duo then devises a special plan to get their parents back together!Here are 8 of our favorite moments from the adorable flick!

1. The Photo That Changed Everything: When the puzzle pieces fit.Hallie: So if your mom is my mom, and my dad is your dad...and we're both born on October 11th, then you and I are...like...sisters.Annie: Sisters? Hallie, we're like twins!Hallie: Oh my god!Annie: Oh my god!

2. Chop, Chop: Once the twins devised their plan to switch spots, they had to resemble one another so their mom and dad wouldn't know the difference. Bring out the scissors for this hilarious scene! Annie tells Hallie as she begins cutting, "Don't shut your eyes!" to which, Hallie responds, "OK, sorry. Got a little nervous!" Then Annie reminds her, "You're nervous? An 11-year-old is cutting my hair!"

3. Beauty Is Pain: We have to be honest, we haven't looked at an apple the same way since this scene. Annie thought the transformation was complete when her hair was chopped, but not so fast! As Hallie looked in the mirror, she realized they missed an important detail that needed to be copied in order for Hallie to truly look like Annie: She needed to pierce her ears. Despite refusing at first, all it took was an apple, a needle and a heavy ounce of courage for Annie to also have pierced ears.

4. Heavenly Combination: Hello, Oreos and peanut butter! Our taste buds thank you, Parent Trap, for introducing us to this genius treat. Not sure if our hips thank you as much as our taste buds, but that's beside the point. We loved when the adorable "twins" chatted and snacked together on their camp bunk beds.

5. #HandshakeGoals: Does anyone remember trying to recreate this handshake? Or, better yet attempt to create your own with the same Parent Trap style?

6. "I've Always Wanted a Big Sister": When Nick (Dennis Quaid) told Annie—who was pretending to be Hallie—that he needed to sit down and talk about his girlfriend Meredith (Elaine Hendrix), Annie had the most brilliant response! Nick told her, "OK, honey...I want to know what you think about making Meredith part of the family." Annie said she thought it was "a brilliant idea" and that it was "a dream come true." The sassy 11-year-old declared, "You're gonna adopt Meredith. That is so sweet, Dad!"

7. Lions, Tigers and Bears, Oh My! Meredith was not too amused with the twins stealing Nick's attention. All hell broke loose when they went camping together. Meredith was cast out on the lake on her inflatable mattress, almost swallowed a lizard and was fooled into hitting sticks together to avoid mountain lions. The "memorable trip" resulted in Meredith giving Nick the ultimatum, to choose the girls or her. Luckily in the girl's favor, he chose his daughters!

8. Storybook Ending: The last scene might be our favorite, proving you have to fight for the one you love. In the Parent Trap's case, Nick and Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson) just needed some reminding of that from their adorable daughters, and they lived happily ever after.

It's hard to believe it's been 17 years since the flick came about! What was your favorite moment?

X Factor’s Simon Cowell: I'd Like To Beat American Idol/n
by Radar Staff
Simon Cowell makes no bones about it: He wants his new show The X Factor to beat American Idol.
The British music mogul, 51, told longtime friend and confidante Piers Morgan Tuesday night that he’d like his new import to surpass the franchise that made him famous in its’ first season airing in the states.
“Everyone knows the big rivalry with you and Simon Fuller, who owns American Idol,” Morgan said. “Could you take down Idol, do you think, in season one?”
PHOTOS:  American Idol’s Most Memorable Contestants
“It’s impossible to predict,” Cowell told Morgan, who then asked him if he’d like to beat his old show.
“Of course,” Cowell said.
Cowell, who acknowledged walking away from a $100 million bonanza to remain on Idol, said he’s not afraid to take a gamble with his latest high profile endeavor.
PHOTOS:  American Idol Winners
“You don’t go into anything contemplating failure, because if you did, you wouldn’t make it,” he said. “If it didn’t work out well, I would be really, really upset, disappointed, because I believe in it. I believe in the show. I’ve done this show for a long time. I do think it’s the best one. I actually do.
“And when it works, it’s fantastic — but you have to be a big boy about these things — and you’ve got to take risks. And part of what I’ve loved about doing this is the risk I’ve taken.”
The X Factor — which has been a hit in the UK for several years, spawning pop star Leona Lewis — premieres Wednesday at 8/7c on Fox.

Another day, more TV revival news. This time it's The Munsters, the classic 1960s sitcom that NBC already attempted to revive with Mockingbird Lane back in 2012.Now, according to Deadline, Odd Mom Out creator and star Jill Kragman is taking a stab at bringing Herman, Lily, Eddie, Grandpa and Lily Munster back to television for the Peacock network. Seth Meyers and Mike Shoemaker are also on board as executive producers. The twist? This version will find the Munster family attempting to fit in with the hipsters of Brooklyn, no a Californian suburb.

Bryan Fuller attempted to bring The Munsters back to TV with the hour-long drama Mockingbird Lane. Jerry O'Connell starred as Herman Munster, Portia De Rossi as Lily Munster, Charity Wakefield as Marilyn Munster, Mason Cook as Eddie Munster and Eddie Izzard as Grandpa. Guest stars in the pilot included American Horror Story's Cheyenne Jackson and The Mindy Project's Beth Grant. NBC aired the pilot as a TV movie for Halloween 2012.Do you want to see The Munsters back on TV? What do you think of the new take? See what other revivals and reboots are in the works below.

Though Alexis, a former financial advisor for the investment bank Morgan Stanley, showed off her growing belly in private family photos, she kept a low profile whenever she was in public to keep her pregnancy a secret.
“She doesn’t leave the house too often because she doesn¹t want anyone to know,” a source told Radar last spring. “And she wears big dresses to cover it up.”

Secret Letter Reveals RFK And Marilyn Monroe Were Lovers!/n
It wasn’t just Mr. President! The truth about JFK lover Marilyn Monroe‘s relationship with his younger brother Robert has been exposed in a newly uncovered letter.
The legendary actress was known to have had an affair with President Kennedy and rumors have circulated about her tryst with younger brother Robert, but now a letter seems to confirm the reports.
Jean Kennedy Smith, the younger sister to John and Bobby penned a letter to Monroe in the early 1960s saying, “Understand that you and Bobby are the new item!” she wrote. “We all think you should come with him when he comes back East!” according to The Telegraph.

There were even rumors that RFK showed up at Monroe’s bungalow not long before her death on August 5, 1962.

Many of the items being auctioned have never been seen by the public and include a “receipt for a bottle of champagne, her 1947 contract with Twentieth Century Fox and a recipe for stuffing jotted down on a slip of paper with an insurance company’s letterhead,”

Kardashians' Secret Shame: Kim's Dad Robert Involved In Bribery, Fraud Scandal/n
Robert Kardashian narrowly avoided a life of corruption and FBI investigations, but RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that his brother Thomas wasn’t as lucky!
The Kardashian patriarch’s family owned the Great Western Packing Company in Vernon. Calif. during his childhood, but the business was shut down by the federal government before Kourtney, Kim, Khloe or Robert was ever born. Robert was in law school at the time, but his brother was working for the company and took the fall for the family.

“In the early 1970s federal prosecutors began a top secret, wide-ranging probe of corruption in the city of Vernon’s meatpacking industry, “ Jerry Oppenheimer explained in The Kardashians: An American Drama. “And dead center in the government’s net was none other than Great Western Packing, the Kardashians’ long-successful family business.”
Tom, then 33, was the general manager of the meatpacking plant when he was arrested for bribing or offering to bribe U.S. Department Agriculture inspectors on March 18, 1974. Radar obtained the court dockets from the cases that ensued, but Tom recalled his side of the story in The Kardashians: An American Drama.

“The FBI took me in handcuffs out of my plant in front of all the people because I was the general manager running things,” he said. “It was totally unexpected. I was taken to the federal building in Los Angeles and booked. And so I was held until the attorneys got me released, which was the same day.”
“Then I had to go to federal court and go in front of a judge, and I ended up pleading guilty to a felony in a plea bargain, so I didn’t have any jail time,” he added. “I was a young man and I felt terrible. There were two other employees who were involved in the day-to-day operations, so the three of us were indicted by the federal government.”

“Believe it or not, it all stated with the federal meat inspectors and the federal meat graders, and they were the ones that could coerce and hold us hostage if we didn’t do certain things like give gratuities and pay those guys to just do their job,” he said, noting that he “couldn’t use the defense that this [bribing USDA graders] was an industry practice.”
He was placed on three years probation in November 1974, and President George H.W. Bush pardoned Thomas in January 1993 before he left office. Robert would go on to defend O.J. Simpson in his murder trial a year later, making Kardashian a household name.

Kesha Breaks Down in Tears in Court ... Denied Release from Sony/nKesha wept openly in court when a judge ruled she will NOT be let out of her Sony Music contract. Kesha is accusing her longtime producer Dr. Luke of sexually, mentally, and physically abusing her during the years they cranked out hit music -- and as a result she wants out of her Sony deal. She had sought an injunction allowing her to make an album outside of Sony, but the judge shot that down Friday morning ... saying she can work with a different producer under the Sony umbrella. Kesha's attorneys say they're worried Sony will blackball her if she refuses to work with Luke, who was not in the courtroom. There was no decision on the abuse claims ... that part of the litigation is ongoing.  Dr. Luke's attorney, Christine Lepera, released a statement to TMZ saying,  "We are pleased with the Court's decision from the bench fully denying Ms. Sebert’s motion for a preliminary injunction. As the Court recognized, Ms. Sebert has always had the ability to proceed with her career if she so chooses. "/n
Tupac Shakur to Be Immortalized As 1,000 lb. Bronze Statue/nTupac fans will have a brand new place to pay their respects when a bigger than life, $500,000 statue of him is erected in Georgia.  Jim Burnett owns the amphitheater formerly known as the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts, and tells us he's installing a new 'Pac monument to replace the old one the rapper's family took when they sold the Center in 2015. Burnett's hired artist Nijel Binns -- who's done statues of Michael Jackson and Shirley Temple -- to lead the project. Binns says he's creating a 7-foot bronze statue based on a 13-inch clay model, which Burnett estimates will cost more than half a million bucks to complete. They're planning to unveil the new statue in September, around the 21st anniversary of Tupac's death. We'll say this ... the new one's way more gangsta than the OG./n

Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell’s love has been immortalized.

The couple received their respective Hollywood Walk of Fame stars in a special joint ceremony on Thursday (May 4, 2017). Joined by Kate Hudson, Reese Witherspoon and Quentin Tarantino, Hawn and Russell celebrated the honor with a sweet kiss at the podium.
“Can we just get married? We’ve never had a celebration like this before,” Hawn, who has been with the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 actor for 33 years, joked.
“This means more to me as I start reflecting on things,” she told the crowd gathered on Hollywood Blvd. “That star is part of ‘yes.’ I really went through something then because I didn’t know what it meant to be a star when people didn’t know who I was. I didn’t get my white picket fence but I got a beautiful house.”

She continued, “I said yes to Kurt Russell. I said yes to Bill Hudson, and without Bill I wouldn’t have had Katie and Oliver [Hudson]. I wish my mom and my dad could see me.”
Russell echoed the sweet sentiments, thanking his longtime love for all the support over the years.
“Goldie to you, I owe my wonderful life,” Russell said. “Simply put Goldie, I cherish you. All of the stars in the sky or the boulevard don’t hold a candle to that. There’s no one else I’d rather be next to than Goldie Hawn.”
Russell started dating Hawn in 1983 following his divorce with actress Season Hubley. He starred in two films — 1984’s Swing Shift and 1987’s Overboard — with her.

It's War! Jay Z's Alleged Love Child In Explosive Courtroom Showdown/n
The messy legal battle involving Jay Z and his alleged love child is heating up, RadarOnline.com has learned, as a trial date has been set for a lawsuit filed by the rapper’s alleged love child, 23-year-old Rymir Satterthwaite against his former attorney.
SEE THE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER HERE
The lawsuit, which alleged “fraud and corruption,” was filed last November, and a trial date was granted for March 24.
“It is expected that the case will be ready for trial [Dec. 3, 2018] and counsel should anticipate trial to begin expeditiously thereafter,” the case management order states.

In Jay Z’s latest legal drama, alleged love child Rymir, his mother, Wanda, and legal guardian Lillie Collie filed a lawsuit against Lillie’s attorney, James Rocco. They accused Rocco of colluding with Jay Z’s legal team to help prevent the rap mogul from ever having to take a DNA test, according to the explosive court documents.
SEE THE SHOCKING COURT DOCUMENTS
The suit also accused Jay Z of lying to the courts about owning property in New Jersey, so he could avoid having to take a paternity test there.
As Radar has reported, Rymir’s mother began her legal battle to prove Jay Z was his father back in 2010. Since then, the rapper and his team of pit-bull lawyers have used a variety of tactics to block a DNA test.
“I will not stop until justice is served in court,” Rymir previously told Radar. “Everybody deserves a fair process in a court of law.”
As reported in January, “Single Ladies” songbird Beyoncé was blindsided by news of Rymir’s existence, and the stunning allegation that Jay Z’s alleged baby mama was a barely legal teen when she got pregnant! The rapper has denied being Rymir’s father.

Martin Schoeller for THR

It wasn't too long ago that a simple mention of the name Alex Rodriguez put a bad taste in our mouths...but that's all changed these days.The 42-year-old former baseball star has made significant progress in redeeming himself ever since his 2014 doping scandal, becoming an asset for sports media and even sparking a much-followed relationship with Jennifer Lopez.So how did he do it? And in just a few years, at that?Rodriguez sat down with The Hollywood Reporter and admitted he simply took responsibility for his mistakes and changed."It starts with being accountable," he stated. "When people can see that you're genuine, that's when they pay attention. You have to own your s--t."

As you likely recall, Rodriguez faced the longest suspension in baseball history in 2014 after he was found to be using performance-enhancing drugs. "There were nights in Miami when I was close to tapping out," he revealed of that time in his life. However, he picked himself back up, and upon his return to the field in 2015, he promised to be a better man.

"When I came back [after the suspension], I wanted to be a different person," he said. "That year off I just had to f--king change and stop being a jerk."He continued, "It's probably too soon for me to say this, but maybe in 10 years I'll be able to say that the ''14 sabbatical' was one of the best things that happened in my life."After playing his final game in on August 12, 2016, Rodriguez has taken a new turn in his career as a baseball analyst and sports broadcaster. In fact, he signed on to contribute to Good Morning America in June as well as continue his work with Fox Sports and CNBC.

Most notably in Hollywood, however, he's been spending a lot of time building his relationship with J.Lo."We both appreciate where we are in our lives," he said of his 48-year-old girlfriend. "We appreciate being parents, and we're so similar; we're both kind of workaholics."And just like Lopez has done in the music industry, no one can deny that Rodriguez certainly left his mark in the world of sports.

"I left it all on the field," he concluded his interview with THR. "My best two years happened at 19 and as a broken-down 40-year-old. I hadn't played in basically two years, two hip surgeries, two knee surgeries, scandal. And if you think about that arc, that tells you a hell of a story, right? The mistakes I've made are loud and clear. But one thing I am proud of is, I did not let those mistakes define who I am. I kept getting up."You can read Rodriguez's full THR interview here.

Driver Who Plowed Into Charlottesville Counterprotesters Identified, Charged with Murder (UPDATE)/n5:22 PM PT -- An Army spokesperson tells TMZ ... James Alex Fields Jr. was enlisted in the Army in 2015, and reported to basic military training in August of that year. He was released from active duty 4 months  later due to a failure to meet training standards.The alleged driver of the car that plowed into a group of counterprotesters in Charlottesville has been charged with one count of second-degree murder ... TMZ has learned. The suspect's been identified as James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohio man. He's facing the second-degree murder charge, along with three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident that resulted in death ... according to the superintendent of the Albemarle Regional Jail. In disturbing video of the crash ... the suspect Fields appears to deliberately drive his Dodge Challenger into a group of counterprotesters walking down the street, then floors it in reverse in an attempt to flee. He was captured shortly after. As we reported ... a 32-year-old woman was killed in the incident. The city's police chief said at least 35 people were injured during Saturday's violence between white nationalist rallygoers and counterprotesters. /n

 Inside Tom & Katie’s Divorce War: Leaked Emails Reveal 'Team Cruise' Accused.../n
Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes played dirty during their nasty divorce, it can FINALLY be revealed.
RadarOnline.com has exclusively obtained a series of emails in which the Hollywood action star’s loyal team of lieutenants paint a damning portrayal of the immediate aftermath of the most shocking split to hit Hollywood in recent years, with sensational allegations of smear campaigns, the leaking private and sensitive information and even setting up staged paparazzi photos in an apparent game of one-upmanship.
Emails between August and September of 2012 expose the battle that brewed between the Mission: Impossible actor and his wife of five-and-a-half years, behind-the-scenes and away from the glare of their fans, as mud was slung from camp to camp.
EXCLUSIVE: Read The Emails That Reveal How ‘Team Cruise’ Accused Holmes Of Leaks, Dirty Tricks… And Having A Hotline To The Paparazzi
Uncovered in the discovery phase of the explosive defamation lawsuit in which Cruise, 51, is suing Bauer Media (publisher of In Touch and Life & Style) for a cover story that he’d “abandoned” his daughter Suri after the split with Holmes, the emails purport to detail attempts to shine 34-year-old Holmes in a positive light, while smearing Cruise’s reputation as a dad.
In August 2012, In Touch ran a cover story with Cruise and Suri, 7, on its cover titled, Forgetting Mommy Already? The feature claimed the mega-star was trying to win over his innocent daughter by spoiling her with lavish gifts and a trip to Disney World in Florida on a private jet — a story his camp, in back-and-forth emails, labelled as being “in true scum form.”

What’s more, Cruise confidantes believed Holmes was desperately trying to discredit her former husband, even going as far as to enlist the help of a pal, Jeanne Yang — the stylist-to-the-stars and co-owner of Holmes & Yang fashion line — to be the middle-man who would trash Cruise to various media outlets.
“Which will only cause Jeanne Yang to keep lying and speaking and keeping these stories going each week,” Cruise’s publicist, Amanda Lundberg, bemoaned to the actor’s team in one email chain, including his sister Lee Ann De Vette.
“A very good friend/editor slipped and said her name to me on Monday,” Lundberg added, explaining how she  knew Yang was the apparent leak.
PHOTOS: Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes’ Relationship Through The Years
“Two good sources told me it is all her… She likely told the press that they stayed at Cinderella’s castle as no one really knew… Every single person tells me she is speaking to the press constantly.”
But according to Cruise’s entourage, it wasn’t just Yang who was helping to restore Holmes’ image. It was alleged in the emails that Holmes’ own team of publicists had a hotline to New York-based photographers and would call as soon as the ex-Dawson’s Creek star planned on leaving her Chelsea apartment building.
“[Katie’s publicist] calls the paparazzi every time K gets ready to leave the building as the doormen are always surprised how they suddenly show up when she is about to leave,” Lundberg alleged, in another email.
And as the stories kept coming, Cruise’s people became even more incensed.
When presented with a story that Bauer planned to publish about Suri being scared for her first day of school because her father made her nervous by telling her she’d have to follow rules and listen to her teachers, Cruise’s legal team fired back calling the accusations were “outrageous” and “defamatory.”
A lawyer, Aaron Moss, wrote how the claims were “completely, 100% false. Mr. Cruise never made these statements, nor did he make any other statements that were intended to scare or did scare his daughter about school.
PHOTOS: Katie Holmes May Be Under Surveillance By A Team Of Mystery Men
“As Mr. Cruise would obviously be one of the only two people involved in this fictional ‘conversation’ (the other being his daughter), he of course is in a position to know the truth.”
The blame again fell on Yang as the whistleblower and Cruise’s team unashamedly announced it was convinced Holmes’ team was purposely putting out false information.
“JY [Jeanne Yang] again. At this point she and they are involved in a conspiracy,” one email blasted. “They know she’s making this bs [bullsh*t] up.”
At that point, Cruise’s high-priced attorney even suggested they needed to send a legal letter to Holmes’ team in an effort to muzzle the leaks and smears!
PHOTOS:Katie Holmes And Suri Go To Children’s Museum Of The Arts In NYC
Said one aide, “If you’re right, I think it’s time that he sent a letter to KH’s lawyers about Yang.”
However, the final straw was still to come: Bauer Media sought comment from Cruise’s camp in September 2012 about him missing Suri’s first day of school, which supposedly left Holmes deeply upset.
The potential for the story to be exposed prompted the Oscar-nominees’ team to reach out to his ex-wife’s team in an effort to stop the blood-letting, once and for all.
“I think this is getting more disgusting if that is even possible. And this should be curbed whenever possible — their daughter doesn’t deserve these incessant lies,” a defiant Lundberg wrote to Holmes’ rep, Nanci Ryder, in another email.
“Can you guys comment and deny this as we all know this is not true. I think that would help stop this which of course is in Suri’s best interest as well.
PHOTOS: They Said It! The 24 Most Explosive & Bizarre Celebrity Interviews Ever
“He would never make a promise he wouldn’t keep and he knew where he would be,” Lundberg explained, noting Cruise was filming in London at the time.
“Plus even if a promise was made — the only person who would know that are T, S and K [Tom, Suri and Katie] so we know this didn’t come from them right?”
Previously revealed in the cache of explosive court documents, after Holmes “blindsided” Cruise with the divorce last year, the Scientology posted-child finally admitted what many have long speculated — that she did it, at least in part, so that she and Suri could leave the controversial religion.
“Ms. Holmes has never indicated in any way that was one of the reasons she left you? …To protect Suri from Scientology?” lawyers asked Cruise in a deposition, a transcript of which Radar obtained.

Finally, Cruise conceded: “Did she say that? That was one of the assertions, yes.” /n
Dallas Cowboys Rookie Jourdan Lewis Found Not Guilty In Domestic Violence Case/nOne less problem for the Dallas Cowboys ...  Rookie cornerback Jourdan Lewis was just found not guilty of attacking his then-girlfriend after a 2-day domestic violence trial.  The 3rd round draft pick had been charged with domestic violence after allegedly roughing up his then-girlfriend at their apartment in Ann Arbor on March 15.  Lewis' girlfriend told cops that the U of M cornerback threw pillows at her during a fight about the electricity bill and then locked himself in a closet for a while. She said he then dragged her across the living room floor and grabbed her by the throat. Lewis told cops she had been hitting him in the face, so he picked her up by the shoulders to try to get out of the room. The case went to trial and a jury found him not guilty. After court, Lewis told the media,  "I'm elated. " Lewis' attorney John Shea says,  "It’s always gratifying to represent someone that you believe in and have the jury tell me I’m right. "  "We’re just happy it came out the way it did. He’s letting it sink in. He’s been under this cloud for awhile and he’ll need some time to put it behind him but this is a good first start. "  "He’s a got a job and he’s anxious to get back to doing it. I’m sure the team is anxious to get him back on the field. "/n

Jesse James on Sandra Bullock: Cheating Is a "Part of Life" The public largely sided with Sandra, which forced Jesse to do some soul-searching. "You learn what's important—that that whole fame thing is not really...It.../n
Jesse James doesn't miss being married to Sandra Bullock.Seven years after multiple women came forward to share their stories of their affairs with Jesse, the West Coast Choppers owner—who describes himself as a "glorified welder"—is looking back at his five-year marriage to the Oscar-winning actress, which ended in early 2010."Yeah, I did cheat on my wife," Jesse, 47, tells The Daily Mail. "Yeah, I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that's end of story. Everything else was just…The easy [potshot] is like, 'Oh, well you cheated on Sandra Bullock.' That's the world's easiest comeback.""In general, both women and men cheat," Jesse adds. "It's part of life."

Jesse felt vilified after Michelle "Bombshell" McGee and other discussed his indiscretions in the tabloids. "It's like people love to see you fall. And the farther you get, the higher you get, the more they love it. I look at myself now and I look at how I was feeling then, and I think I was completely overreacting as far as letting it really get to me. I think it was having 50 or 60 or paparazzi outside my house for five or six months," Jesse says. "That was not a good feeling.""I'm a fighter, man; I come from the tradition of if you do something I don't like, I'm going to punch you. There's no lawsuits—nothing. We're just going to fight it out," the former Monster Garage host adds. "It's hard for me to bite my cheeks and not say anything and just look down."

The public largely sided with Sandra, which forced Jesse to do some soul-searching. "You learn what's important—that that whole fame thing is not really...It's meaningless when your quality of life goes to zero," he says. Jesse "always felt more relaxed" in Dripping Springs, Texas, where he currently lives, so he "opened a shop, started doing projects" and eventually found "more and more" work. "Finally, in 2010, I was like, 'I'm out of here.' I got sick of L.A. I went through a bunch of B.S. I thought, 'It's time to go.' Get a better life for my kids, you know? A lot of good happened out of [the split]...It helped me focus on being a dad more. It helped me focus on doing the right thing and being myself...getting out of L.A. and getting a better life for my kids."

In 2013, Jesse married his fourth wife drag racer Alexis DeJoria, 39."It's just a different deal this time, and it just happened," Jesse says of marrying Alexis. "I was like, 'I'm just going to be that old dude who's single now and never find anybody else,' and then it's like, 'There she is.' We like the same stuff, the same music, the same everything. We like all these things. It makes me look back at other relationships and be like, 'I was an idiot! What was I thinking? That was never going to work.' But I guess that's how you learn, you know?"

Jesse says his 11-year marriage to Karla James "doesn't count," as he was 10 years her junior when they tied the knot in 1991. "I was 20 when I got with her and she was 30. Isn't that kind of bad?" he asks The Daily Mail. "Like, my daughter's 22 right now, and I imagine if some 30-year-old dude came round, I'd be like, 'No, no, no.' That was kind of scandalous. No ill will [towards Karla], but by the time I was 30 and she was 40, we had nothing—nothing—in common."

Why MAFS' Ashley Petta Found It 'Hurtful' That New Husband Anthony D'Amico Would 'Sacrifice Her Safety'
/n
Married at First Sight is back! On season 5 of Kinetic Content’s hit social experiment show, three couples meet for the first time at the altar just minutes before exchanging vows. The newlyweds (whose wedding portraits were taken by Mike Staff Productions) are alternating each week blogging exclusively about the ups and down of marriage for PEOPLE. Check back after every episode for the latest in their road to (possibly) happily ever after! This week’s blog comes from Anthony D’Amico, a 33-year-old sales and marketing professional who’s ready for kids, and Ashley Petta, a 30-year-old restaurant manager who’s been single for the past two years.
ASHLEY’S TAKE
I would say that our honeymoon was a success. We had a ton of fun and really got to know each other. I was sad to leave but also anxious to get home and find out what real life with Anthony would be like.
Coming home didn’t go very smooth, though. The airline lost all of our luggage. Anthony got his back the next day, but I wasn’t so lucky. Try getting camera ready without any makeup or hair stuff! I did my best to stay calm, but I really thought all my stuff was gone for good! Thankfully, they ended up finding it a week later. I guess my luggage just wanted another week in the Bahamas!
I was excited to show Anthony my apartment. I think you can learn a lot about a person by seeing how they live. We have already established that I don’t cook. My kitchen had a lot of cabinet space that I wasn’t using, so it only made sense to use the cabinets for shoe storage! When you live in a big city where rent is ridiculously high and the space you get for your money is tiny, you have to get creative with storage! I knew once Anthony and I got a place together, I was probably going to have to find a new place to store my shoes!
Before showing Anthony my apartment, I already knew that it wouldn’t work for us because it was barely big enough for just me.
I really liked Anthony’s apartment. I would have definitely lived there if he didn’t have a roommate. My bed is way more comfortable and he had holes in his sheets, so it was definitely time for some new bedding, but overall his place was really nice and clean! I just don’t think it would have been very nice to ask his roommate to move out. His lease was almost up anyway, so it only made sense to find a new place.

Finding a new spot with Anthony wasn’t very difficult. There were obviously things that we both wanted in a new place. Anthony wanted an in-unit washer and dryer, a nice kitchen and a neutral location. All I wanted was a parking space. I was basically willing to live anywhere in the city as long as I had my own parking spot.
Let me explain … I work nights and I don’t typically get home until after 3 a.m. Street parking can be extremely difficult in Chicago, especially at three in the morning when most people are already home. Without a designated spot, I could end up having to park several blocks away. Chicago is not the safest city and I don’t feel comfortable walking the streets alone at that time in the morning!
It did really bother me that Anthony couldn’t understand why parking is an absolute must for me. I wouldn’t want him parking far and walking alone at that time, so it was a little hurtful that he was okay sacrificing my safety for the things he wanted. I was ready and willing to compromise on anything else except that.
The second place we looked at was much better anyway. The views were absolutely amazing. We could see the Chicago river from our bedroom! It was also right off of Michigan Avenue and we both ended up with our very own designated parking spots … so it all worked out!

ANTHONY’S TAKE
I did not want to leave the honeymoon, but by the same token, I couldn’t wait to start going through all the normal things that married couples do. I wanted to start looking for a place and creating a life for ourselves.
When Ashley and I started looking for a place to live, it was a little hectic because it was SO quick — literally right after the honeymoon. The first thing that we had to do was really figure out what were the most important things for us to have in the place that we were moving into. It was amazing to see that Ashley and I were both on the same page with just about everything. We both wanted in-unit laundry, a nice kitchen and enough space for both of us. With Ashley and I working on opposite sides of Chicago, there was some difficulty finding the perfect middle ground in order for us not to really add too much time to our daily commutes.
Parking was another thing we had to look at. I have lived in Chicago for eight years and have always had street parking available to me. I came to find out that Ashley has always had a designated parking spot. Initially, when Ashley told me this, I didn’t know why it was so important for her to have this parking spot until she told me that a few nights a week, she comes home at 3 a.m. That was the game changer for me. There was no way I wanted her looking for street parking that late at night and then having to walk a far distance (that late) if she couldn’t find anything close.
Since most of our wants aligned, I knew we would be able to find a place pretty quickly.
As for her boots in the cupboards, this was so hilarious; I’ve never seen this method of storage before with any of my friends. It really just told me that she didn’t have enough closet room to put the shoes. Space in Chicago comes at a premium, so I thought it was very inventive of her to create extra space for herself. It was a totally different approach to the space issue than I’ve ever seen in the past. I just have one question: where are my pots, pans and dry goods going to go if the shoes are there??
Married at First Sight airs Thursdays (9 p.m. ET) on Lifetime.

The Ellen DeGeneres Show got a little racy Thursday.Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer appeared on the show to promote their mother-daughter comedy Snatched (in theaters Friday) when Ellen DeGeneres asked if they'd like to play a game.DeGeneres handed the actresses paddles with the words "I Have" and "I Haven't" written on either side. She then read a series of statements and said she would play along with her guests.Here are the prompts DeGeneres read:• Never have I ever taken a naked selfie.• Never have I ever danced on tables for money.• Never have I ever gotten a tattoo that I regret.• Never have I ever been caught by the police having sex.• Never have I ever helped Ellen with a giveaway on a show.Hawn said "I Have" to quite a few—but she blamed Kurt Russell for most of them.

"I showed it to him earlier this morning, and he said, 'Where was that?'" Hawn told Schumer and the host. "I said, 'That was our house, honey. Should I be scared?' He lives in the moment, you know? That's what I love about Kurt. And then he forgets about it a moment later, but..."

Happy birthday to Hollywood's golden girl!Betty Whitecelebrates her 95th birthday today, reaching yet another milestone in a decades-spanning career that is still just as active as ever. It's hard to believe it's been 55 years since the beloved actress made her feature film debut in Advise & Consent, a performance that led to breakout role after breakout role both in television and film. And yes, her time in the spotlight is so legendary that in 2013, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Betty as having the longest TV career for any female entertainer. From The Mary Tyler Moore Show to The Golden Girls and every LOL-worthy game show appearance in between, it's nearly impossible to pick just one of Betty's roles as our favorite, and why should we have to? In honor of her special day, we picked seven of our favorite Betty White performances. Here's to so many more!

The Mary Tyler Moore Show: Oh Sue Ann Nivens, how we love thee. White starred in the long-running 70s sitcom, winning back-to-back Emmys for her comedic chops that later led to her landing her own self-titled show on CBS.

The Golden Girls: If Betty wasn't a household name by 1985, she certainly was after the classic sitcom following four widows-turned-roomies hit TV. Then 63, White starred opposite Bea Arthur, Estelle Getty and Rue McClanahan throughout The Golden Girls' seven-year run, and earned four Golden Globe nominations and one Emmy for the role. 

Password: The birthday girl is known as the First Lady of Game Shows (FLOGS for short), and in 1983, Betty became the first woman to win a Daytime Emmy in the Outstanding Game Show Host category for Just Men! White went on to appear and host a handful of game shows well into the 2000s, and even met her hubby—TV personality Allen Ludden—on Password. 

The Proposal: More modern moviegoers were introduced to the national treasure that is Betty when she starred opposite Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynold in the 2008 rom-com. The actress was wildly hilarious as Grandma Annie, proving she still had it going on at 86-years-old. 

Saturday Night Live: The powers-that-be granted the wish of more than 500,000 Facebook users who joined a group requesting White host SNL back in 2010, and boy did she deliver. At 88, Betty became the oldest person to host the sketch series, and during her opening monologue teased that she "didn't know what Facebook was, and now that I do know what it is, I have to say, it sounds like a huge waste of time." Never change, Betty. 

Hot in Cleveland: In 2010, Betty returned to the small screen for TV Land's first scripted comedy co-starring Valerie Bertinelli. For five years, the actress wowed TV lovers by playing a Polish caretaker with a not-so-secret wild past.Wishing Betty her best year yet!

Girl Who Survived One Month In Woods Reportedly Found Naked In Dirt, High On Meth/n
The woman who survived one month in the woods was reportedly found naked, scratched and bruised near in a wooded area in Alabama, 25 days after she last spoke to her parents, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Lisa Theris, 25, who claimed she survived her time in the woods by eating nothing but mushrooms, berries and muddy water, was likely just high on meth when she went missing, authorities have said to DailyMail.com. The two men – Manley Davis and Randall Oswald – who were with her were so “geeked out” that they believed she was dead, and actually blamed each other for her murder. One of them even claimed the other shot her in the head and buried her in the wooded area!

After the claim “We did a lot of ghost-hunting,” Bullock County Sheriff Raymond Rodgers exclusively told DailyMail.
Divers and cadaver dogs were reportedly sent out to search for bodies.
The two men – who clearly lied about the murder, since Theris is alive – are both being held on separate burglary charges. Theris allegedly refused to participate in a robbery with them the day of her disappearance. She too, however, had a stint in jail before the incident.

As Radar reported, Theirs walked out of the woods 25 days after getting lost in the area.
The woman who found her allegedly “saw something moving in the bushes as she was driving along the highway and turned around.”
Theris is currently recovering from the bizarre incident back home with her family in Louisville.

Looking good, Sara Gilbert!The 40-year-old The Talk co-host stepped out for the first time since giving birth to newborn son Rhodes Emilio Gilbert Perry yesterday.Gilbert and wife Linda Perry were spotted doing some shopping in Beverly Hills on Tuesday as they pushed baby Rhodes in a stroller. Gilbert's body looked great during the outing, proving she's lost all her baby weight just days after the delivery (insane!). The former Roseanne star, who was dressed in gray sneakers, skinny blue jeans and a green top, looked super happy while picking up baby items with her family.

Meanwhile, Perry, 49, went casual in red sneakers, gray sweatpants, a Black Sabbath T-shirt and a beanie. The cute couple hit up fancy baby store Trico Field for some retail therapy and were snapped with big shopping bags afterwards.Gilbert, who also has daughter Sawyer, 7, and son Levi, 10, from a previous relationship, gave birth to her and Perry's first child together earlier this month. Gilbert's Talk co-hosts announced the exciting news on the show. They also debuted the adorable first photo of little Rhodes.Gilbert originally announced she was pregnant with her third child back in September.

Houston Teacher Arrested After Becoming Pregnant With 13-Year-Old Student's Baby/n
A Houston-based middle school teacher was arrested this week after admitting to an affair with a 13-year-old student — and getting pregnant in the process!
Alexandria Vera, 24, turned herself into police, confessing that she was in love with the boy, and that they had had sex “on almost a daily basis” during their forbidden romance.
The relationship began last September, when the teen, now 14, asked for Vera’s Instagram account information. Though she didn’t accept his request to follow her at first, the English teacher reportedly messaged him directly after he didn’t attend class one day.

According to court papers, their interaction soon escalated, as the two exchanged phone numbers and began meeting outside of the classroom.
The boy began staying overnight at Vera’s house, with the 24-year-old introducing him as her little brother to neighbors.
Students were made aware of their fling when the boy allegedly grabbed Vera’s butt during class.
“He like grabbed her butt, and everybody saw it,” an anonymous student told ABC. “And then they were talking about it.”

Shockingly, the teen’s family was aware of the relationship, and even “very supportive and excited about the baby,” court documents reveal.
Of course, Vera, who is already a mother to a 4-year-old daughter, had an abortion after Children’s Protective Services questioned her about the relationship.
After her admission to authorities, Vera was put on administrative leave. Her bond is posted at $100,000.
“I have chills just because of this, just think that the teacher would even do something like this,” Mary Claycomb, a parent at the school, told ABC. /n

Surf’s up for Europe’s most eccentric royal!
Proving that you are never too old to wear a two-piece, the 86-year-old Duchess of Alba hit the beach this week with her boy toy husband, and RadarOnline.com has photos of their romantic summer getaway.
PHOTOS: The Duchess Of Alba Strips Off On The Beach
Dressed in a floral bikini and bright purple sunglasses, the Spanish aristocrat, who holds the record for the most titles, wasn’t worried about the aging affects of the sun as she and Alfonso Diez, 61, enjoyed a frolic in the Mediterranean off the island of Formentera.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, the couple was married in an extravagant ceremony last October in her 15th century palace in Seville, Spain, despite initial protests from her children and grandchildren.

Throughout their beach day the elderly duchess was kept safe and sound as her new husband firmly held her left hand, while a mystery friend in a pink cut-out swimsuit lent support on the other side.
Also known as Maria del Rosario Cayetana Alfonso Victoria Eugenia Francisca Fitz-James Stuart y Silva, the glorious grandma is famous for her eclectic style and colorful clothes, making her latest beach attire the perfect summer outfit for her.

After they were done cooling down in the water, the newlywed covered up with a sheer flowered dress and floppy pink hat for a walk on the sand.
Just like many Hollywood stars, the head of the 539-year-old House of Alba faced a sex scandal earlier this year when a 30-year-old photograph of the duchess as she sunbathed topless in Ibiza was splashed on the cover of the racy Spanish magazine Interviu.

Lupita Nyong'o -- Thief Threw Oscar Dress Off the Balcony!/nCops are flustered as to how the Lupita Nyong'o Oscar dress escaped detection when it was taken from her hotel room, but now we know ... it was thrown off her balcony.  TMZ broke the story ... the surveillance video was unhelpful. The cameras weren't trained on Lupita's door and none of the cameras on the floor showed anything suspicious. The guy who stole the dress -- who called TMZ Friday with a road map to recovery in The London West Hollywood bathroom -- told us he knew where the cameras were placed in the hallway so he was never seen. As for the dress ... he said he threw it over the balcony and someone on the ground picked it up.  As we reported ... the thief says he took 2 of the pearls off of the dress and went down to the Garment District for appraisal, but found they were worthless fakes. That's when the thief took the dress back to the hotel.  The thief told us he knew Lupita was in the room where they took the dress and waited for the opportunity to enter ... which they did when they found the door was ajar.  By the way ... the thief also says he saw Lupita's Oscar gift bag -- valued at $125,000 which he didn't take. Looks like he chose wrong.  /n

Farrah Abraham Makes Her Vaginal Rejuvenation A Public Affair By Sharing The Procedure Online With Her Followers!/n

Well this was a choice.
Over the weekend, Farrah Abraham took to Instagram in order to document her recent vaginal rejuvenation procedure at the Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center in El Lay. Oh man!!
Related: Farrah & Her Mom Go Back & Forth Over Abuse Claims
And while this procedure would make most women cringe, the Teen Mom OG star seemed more than ready to rejuvenate her lady bits. The MTV celeb posted: 




Loving my lady parts! #vaginalrejuvenation 💕 @bhrclasvegas @beverlyhillsrejuvenationcenter @la_laser_lady @sarafowler_ Schedule your noninvasive appointment today 💯💯💯 #Lasvegas #beverlyhillsA post shared by Farrah Abraham (@farrah__abraham) on Aug 26, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT


In the video (above), Miz Abraham's doctor shared some deets about the "noninvasive" surgery. The medical professional noted:

"What this does is distributes little wounds through radio frequency which kind of breaks up the collagen and forces it to restore during that healing process, so everything becomes tighter and you actually experience …"
In typical Farrah fashion, the mother-of-one responded with:
"Like I'm 16 again?"
Ugh, Farrah. Don't compare your vagina to that of a 16-year-old's — that's just creepy.
And it appears as though fans were less than impressed with Farrah's decision to share the private procedure online as several people weighed in on the post. One follower dished:
"My god…poor little Sophia. A mother who 'loves' her body so much she altered every bit of it. Great example. I hope Sophia will grow into a strong and independent woman who does not need her 'mother' to be around."
Ouch! Another hater penned:
"Nasty. Why would you share this? You're 26 years old. You don't need to worry about that lol"
Oof. Nonetheless, the 26-year-old isn't getting only hate online as a different fan defended:
"They paid her for this. It's a plug. That's why she shared it. She's a business woman. Why keep asking why she shared it?? She shared it because she got paid to plug a business."
Not to mention, the reality TV vet is no stranger to plastic surgery as she's previously had work done on her nose, chin, and breasts.
We wonder if this vaginal rejuvenation is the last piece of cosmetic work Abraham plans to get in 2017?? We guess only time will tell.

A Bachelorette No More — Rachel Lindsay Confirms She's Engaged To One Of Her Season 13 Suitors!/n

Nick Viall, who??
That's obviously what Rachel Lindsay is asking herself these days as she revealed on Thursday she's "very much engaged." The season 13 Bachelorette confirmed her engagement news while chatting with reporters ahead of Monday's premiere of the ABC dating competition.
Related: Couples From The Bachelor — Where Are They Now??
While Miz Lindsay didn't drop any specifics about her fiancé, she did tease: 

"If I had a list he would check everything off."
In case you forgot, the 31-year-old first appeared on Viall's season of the Bachelor and was a fan favorite as she made it to the reality TV vet's final three. Nick ultimately picked Vanessa Grimaldi and proposed to the special education teacher during the season 21 finale.
But the Dallas attorney has clearly moved on as she was more than giddy while talking about her new man. On their life post filming The Bachelorette, Lindsay added:

"Every morning I wake up and pinch myself."
Mind you, the twosome wrapped filming for the reality show only a week ago. Nonetheless, Rachel and her unnamed fiancé are having trouble keeping their love under wraps. She continued:

"It is hard. I'm used to a long-distance relationship where we can't see each other all the time and we can't be public. I'm used to that. But it's hard when you're so excited about something and you can't share it with everyone. But we make sure to communicate with each other all the time, and that's all you can really do."
We REALLY hope these two don't accidentally spoil anything. Remember what a bummer it was when Kaitlyn Bristowe and Shawn Booth accidentally leaked their happy ending??
Related: Ben Higgins Speaks On His 'Tough' Breakup From Lauren Bushnell
Speaking of the future Mr. and Mrs. Booth, it appears as though Rachel is looking to them as an example on how to keep a Bachelor nation romance going. On why she isn't rushing to the altar, the Texas native explained:

"I want us to get the chance to get to know each other. Maybe it will be kick. Maybe it will be a longer engagement like Shawn [Booth] and Kaitlyn [Bristowe]. We just really want to get to know each other."
Fair enough. At the end of the day, we just want Rachel to be happy — and she seems pretty freakin' happy!

Kanye West -- I Messed Up ...

Kanye took to Twitter late Friday with this mea culpa ...  "God's dream .... Never speak on kids again. " Mr. West crossed the line when he told Wiz,  "I own your child!!! "  The implication -- Kanye made Amber famous, which then made her desirable to Wiz, which then produced Sebastian.  Yeezy, who said his new  "Waves " album was gospel seems to be hanging with the right people ...  2 Chainz posted a pic of Ye in studio with gospel musician Kirk Franklin.     / //n

American Crime Story's Keesha Sharp Reveals Key Role Johnnie Cochran's Wife Played in O.J. Simpson Trial/n
What did the woman behind Johnnie Cochran have to do with him taking that case?   
It’s been an adrenaline-packed ride for the first two episodes of The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. The legendary lawyer who took on the impossible in defending O.J. Simpson is no longer here to share his reasons for doing so, but actress Keesha Sharp – who portrays Cochran’s wife in the FX show documenting the famous 1994 murder trial – has her thoughts.   
“For my character Dale Cochran, you didn’t realize she was the woman holding up Johnnie,” says the actress. “She’s the one who encouraged him to take the case otherwise he wasn’t going to.”    
Though Sharp did not discuss the role with Dale prior to shooting the series, she would love to her thoughts about the series.   
“With Dale, one thing that Ryan didn’t want us to do was talk to the people that we were portraying because sometimes that can get in the way,” she said. “You are starting to portray someone instead of just reading what the script is and being true to the script and therefore portraying this person from a true place. So, I did not meet her but I really would love to meet her now.”     
As for how she actually prepared for the role, it sounds like the preparation involved something akin to an expansive term paper.   
“I got as much information as I could, I looked her up, who she was, I know she was a professional, executive and all those things and from that point on it was putting myself there as an actor,” Sharp said, continuing on with what she needed to know to bring the character to life. “Who am I in this role and who is this woman holding up this man Johnnie Cochran to take such a case where it looked so hopeless.  I mean he was going to jail, I mean he was in the Bronco with a gun you know? It looked like he was a goner. But Johnnie saw something and Dale saw something to say ‘no, I think you can do this. You Johnnie, if anybody can do this you can.”   
Though Sharp has her opinion on whether or not O.J. was guilty, she’s certain that was not what the case was about for the Cochran’s.   
 “Now as an adult, knowing all the information I know and watching everything I could about this case, even from the civil case, I was convinced that he had done,’ she said. “But I felt like the case wasn’t about that.  The case became about the brutality that African American people even today are dealing with.  I saw police officers, not all, not even the majority, but those small number of bad ones exist so I think the case became about that for Johnnie not about his innocence or guilt but it became about police brutality.”

Curious about K-pop but don’t know where to start? Longtime veteran of the most interesting genre in music? Just an all-around happy-go-lucky music lover in general? Well, you’ve come to the right place because it’s an exciting time in the world of K-pop.

Since we at Celebuzz love any and all music, every week we’ll be taking a look back at the best things that happened in K-Pop. There were several highlights in the K-Pop world from this week as well as last. EXO made their comeback with the music videos for new songs “Monster” and “Lucky One;” Sistar came back with “I Like That;” 4Minute announced they were splitting; and much more.
Sistar
Sistar made their comeback with “I Like That,” off their fourth EP Insane Love (released yesterday, June 21, 2016). Watch the sexy music video here.





EXO
EXO released their third studio album, Ex’Act, on June 9, 2016 in both Korean and Mandarin versions. Last year, they broke records when their second album, Exodus, earned the largest first-week sales ever for a K-Pop group on the Billboard 200; this time around, domestic pre-sales for the album surpassed 660,000, making it the most pre-ordered K-pop album of all time. In addition, their single “Monster” earned EXO their first No. 1 on Billboard’s World Digital Songs Chart, making them only the sixth K-Pop act to do so.
They won the top prizes this week on Inkigayo, Show! Music Core, Music Bank, and M! Countdown for “Monster.” Watch the dance version music video for “Monster” below (and the full video here), as well as the music video for “Lucky One.





“Lucky One” (Watch the Mandarin version here)





Watch EXO’s live comeback performance on Music Bank below:





4Minute
4Minute announced they were disbanding after unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations, just days before what would have marked their seventh anniversary together. Only HyunA renewed her contract with Cube Entertainment.
A Cube Entertainment rep stated:
As the contract end date approaches, the members have been in discussions for renewal, but while the agency tried to persuade them to continue the group, it ended up accepting the decision by the five members that they will not continue as a group. Due to the different opinion of the members, for all intents and purposes, the group will disband.
Reminisce by watching some of 4Minute’s best music videos, including “Crazy” and their most recent Skrillex collaboration “Hate,” below:

Celebrities Spotted Out and About – Week of April 25/n/n
Where In the World Is Garbanzo? Aaron Paul Posts Desperate Plea For a Missing 12-Year-Old Bulldog/n
Garbanzo, a 12-year-old English Bulldog who needs medication to survive, is missing — and Hollywood is working to bring him home.
On Friday, Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul posted an Instagram begging the citizens of Los Angeles to keep an eye out for the “beautiful” pup.
He wrote, “Dear LA, This beautiful boy got lost and needs to find his way back home. If you know anything please call this number or repost. Thank you so much. Ap”
His accompanying hashtag #FindGarbanzo has spread on social media, spurring a search for the pooch.





 Dear LA, This beautiful boy got lost and needs to find his way back home. If you know anything please call this number or repost. Thank you so much. Ap #FindGarbanzo
A post shared by Aaron Paul (@glassofwhiskey) on Aug 18, 2017 at 10:51am PDT


According to a Facebook post on the Lost and Found Paws in Los Angeles page, Garbanzo went missing on June 22. He was a beloved mascot for the London Hotel on the Sunset Strip and was last seen near his home in the Doheny Estates.
FROM PEN: George W. Bush’s New Rescue Pup Was a Set-Up (of the Best Kind!)

“That same night, owners began an aggressive search for him the neighborhood and surrounding areas,” the post read. “Three days later, his Dog Dad received a phone call from a woman who reported seeing Garbanzo being walked by woman in her mid twenties in the vicinity of W 3rd St and N Crescent Heights Blvd. She described his arthritic, halting walk. The woman told her she had found Garbanzo. Garbanzo’s Dad immediately ran down to the area to put up flyers and canvas the neighborhood. Others also reported seeing Garbanzo with the same unidentified woman.”

The post continued, “While this young woman may believe she is being kind by taking in a senior dog, bur she doesn’t realize he is at risk of going into failure. He is chipped, so returning him to his family would be as simple as having him scanned.”
Anyone who spots Garbanzo are being asked to call 310-266-8000. The owners are offering a $5,000 reward, no questions asked.

News that police were called at 10:17 a.m. local time and the London Ambulance Service were called to the scene. A post-mortem will be done "in due course" and the next of kin are in the process of being informed, but the case is being treated as "non-suspicious" at this time.Gest was scheduled to go on tour throughout the United Kingdom, putting on 24 shows alongside Dina Carroll, Russell Tompkins Jr. and Freda Payne. The tour was titled David Gest Is Not Dead But Alive With Soul, a joke about the fact that some of his Celebrity Big Brother co-stars thought he was dead.

He was last seen on CBB, but he departed the house after only 13 days because of medical issues.The 62-year-old star married Liza Minnelli in 2002, but they called it quits after 18 months of marriage, with Gest claiming Minnelli violently abused him throughout their marriage. He filed a lawsuit for $10 million, but it was dismissed in 2006 and their divorce was finalized in 2007.Gest was close friends with Michael Jackson and even produced his 2001 TV tribute, Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special.

 Inside Val Kilmer's Life-Or-Death Throat Cancer Fight — 'Docs Believe They've Got It'.../n
RadarOnline.com can reveal that Val Kilmer may be winning his life-or-death battle against throat cancer.
“Val is telling friends that doctors believe they’ve gotten it,” a source tells Radar of the Top Gun star, 56, who “speaks in a whisper and can’t really talk.”
As Radar reported, doctors found a tumor after Kilmer was suddenly hospitalized last January. His mom, Gladys Leach, confirmed at the time that her son had a throat tumor and tracheotomy.

Now, said the source: “He actually looked pretty good — sturdy and not particularly frail.”
However, added the source, “Val’s whole mouth is wired up and he has a small whitish square on his throat near his Adam’s apple where the surgery was.”
According to the source, Kilmer has been getting through his health ordeal thanks to the support of some of his famous friends.
Said an insider: “Val is telling pals how Cher has been a huge help and a friend to him throughout this experience.” /n
Glen Campbell's Widow Says Tanya Tucker Despicable for Exploiting His Death /nTanya Tucker's tribute to Glen Campbell has struck the wrong chord with his widow Kim Campbell, who thinks Tucker's serving a  "distorted fairy tale " of their short-lived romance to the masses ... but Tucker says it's purely for charity. Tanya, who dated Glen in the '80s before he married Kim, released the song  "Forever Loving You " about Glen, on August 9, a day after he died of Alzheimer's. She's been on a media blitz promoting the track ever since. Kim's people say Tanya is  "callous and disrespectful, " exploiting Glen's name. They say it pains Kim to see Glen and Tanya's faces all over tabloids, with headlines like  "He Was The Love of My Life. " Kim's camp says, in reality, Tanya had nothing to do with Glen for 35 years, and Kim worked tirelessly to help him battle Alzheimer's. Tanya's  "Today " performance is what sent Kim through the roof, when the hosts expressed their sympathy to Tucker and not the grieving widow and 3 kids Glen left behind.  Tanya's camp says she's just using the moment to raise awareness for Alzheimer's. We got Tanya in NYC this week and she seemed pretty clueless to any hard feelings./n
Baby No. 2 on the Way for Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale/n

 
Rose Byrne is pregnant!
The actress, 38, and her longtime boyfriend, Bobby Cannavale, 47, are expecting their second child together.
The Neighbors star confirmed the exciting news in a recent interview with Australia’s Jones magazine.
“I’m a little tired but feeling good,” she said after a photo shoot with her brother, photographer George Byrne. “Everyone was very sweet on set today, and you always get a little bit more attention when you’re pregnant, which is fabulous.”
The couple — who have been dating since 2012 and co-starred in Spy, Annie and Adult Beginners — welcomed their son, Rocco Robin, in February 2016.





 Happy Mothers Day. Me and Rocky win.

A post shared by Bobby (@bobby_cannavale) on Jan 31, 2017 at 9:20pm PST


Cannavale revealed the happy news on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, sharing that his pal Al Pacino had given him a diaper cake.
“We’re just really, really over the moon,” said the Master of None actor, who’s also a dad to his 21-year-old son, Jack, from a previous relationship. “We’re in bliss right now.”
Hitting the 2016 Met Gala red carpet three months after giving birth to Rocco, Byrne — who sparked engagement rumors last fall after she stepped out wearing a diamond ring on her ring finger — told news.com.au she was “still in a fog.”
“I haven’t even left my apartment in three months,” she told the outlet. “It takes an hour and 45 minutes to get out of the house with a baby, and by the time I’m ready, I’m exhausted. I have a new appreciation for motherhood having just become a parent. Really, I’ve turned around a lot. I’m tired, but even so, all of it’s great. But you definitely go into a cocoon.”

R. Kelly and Marie Osmond are the two latest artists that have denied rumors alleging that they will be performing at Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Kelly and Osmond join the list of other singers, which includes Andrea Bocelli, Céline Dion, and Elton John,  who will definitely not be performing at the PEOTUS’s inaugural ceremony on Jan. 20, 2017. Kelly tweeted out the following image in a Twitter post that stated: “End.Of.Story.”

Osmond addressed rumors claiming that she would be performing at the inauguration on Twitter as well. Earlier in the week during an interview with Yahoo! Finance, Osmond said that she had not been asked to perform at the ceremony. When she was asked if she would if the opportunity arose, Osmond responded, “I don’t get political, but this is what I do know: I have such a diverse family. I have eight of the most unique children ever. They all respect each others’ different beliefs … but I think when it comes to our country, we need to unite, and to not support our president I think is wrong.”
Her follow-up response on Twitter regarding her involvement in the inauguration ceremony read, “Many of you have seen various stories saying that I volunteered or that I am performing at the inauguration. So let me be clear! I had no intention of performing at this inauguration, no matter who won!”
She continued, “I try to stay out of politics. I’m an entertainer. My interview statement simply tried to be nice and promote a message of love, not hate.”

Joe Nichols ‘Would Probably Be in Jail’ If His Kids Went Into Music: ‘There’s Too Many Rotten Guys’ in the Industry/n

 
Joe Nichols is one protective papa.
In a recent interview with PEOPLE Now, the country musician admitted that if his daughters want to follow in his famous footsteps, he’s afraid he’ll have to step in and shield them from any potential bad eggs in the industry.
“There’s too many rotten guys in music for me to ever be really okay with it,” Nichols shares of his concern for Georgia Blue, 3, Dylan River, 5, and Ashelyn, 18. “I would probably be in jail if they ever really wanted to pursue that.”
The 40-year-old “Sunny and 75” singer did admit of his girls that he “would help [them] completely” in launching a potential music career after they finish both high school and college, if that was still the direction they wanted to go professionally.

RELATED: Joe Nichols: I’ll Do “Anything” to Make My Family Happy
Nichols’ latest album Never Gets Old, his first album in four years, touches on family connection and romance. His wife Heather approved of the title track — which Nichols told PEOPLE in July was no coincidence because of how much the song “reminds” him of Heather.
As it turns out, his middle daughter approves wholeheartedly too. While all three of his kids are “musical,” Nichols tells PEOPLE that Dylan couldn’t stop singing and dancing to the album’s title track after he played the song on his small speakers at home. She also “makes up a new song every day.”
“[Dylan] rhymes perfectly — it’s funny to watch,” he explains. “And my 3-year-old is just now coming out of her shell and she’s singing as well.”

 Madonna Badger's Devastation Over Xmas Fire, Thought She Was 'Going Nuts' After Having.../n
By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
Almost a year after the horrific Christmas Eve fire that wiped out her family after claiming the lives of her three children and parents, Madonna Badger says she still talks to the little girls when she closes her eyes at night. 
“I’ve seen my children in my dreams,” the devastated mom told Matt Lauer during a heartbreaking interview on Thursday’s episode of TODAY. “When I pray, I see my children. Lily came to me very early on and said, ‘Don’t worry, Mommy, I’m right there in your heart and I love you.’
PHOTOS: Celebs Who Died Young
“Once when I was having a level 10, the worst sort of crisis, (where it) feels like blood is coming out of my eyes, Sarah came to me in the mirror and she said, ‘Mommy, there’s nothing to be afraid of. Everything is going to be OK.'”
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, a blaze sparked by yule log embers in the century-old Connecticut house killed Lily, 10; her 7-year-old twin sisters Sarah and Grace; and their grandparents Lomer Johnson and Pauline Johnson. All of the victims died from smoke inhalation, except for Lomer, who fell through the roof during a heroic effort to rescue his granddaughters.
PHOTOS: Stars Who Died In Bizarre Ways 
Rather than being a comfort though, Badger admitted that the vivid visions of her children troubled her at first and made her think she was going crazy. “Honestly, I thought I was delusional. I thought I was a little nuts,” she confessed.
What finally made her believe the visions were real was the book Proof of Heaven, by Dr. Eben Alexander, which as Radar has previously revealed, details the formerly skeptical neurosurgeon’s near-death experience while in a coma and makes a strong case for existence of the afterlife.
PHOTOS: Celebrities Found Dead In Famous Hotels
In the immediate aftermath of the deadly fire, Badger admits that it was a struggle to go on – she even attempted suicide – and felt immense guilt whenever she smiled or felt an ounce of happiness.
“I’m shocked that I’m doing OK, but I’m doing really well,” she told Lauer, as the anniversary of the devastating incident approaches. “I don’t feel that way (anymore). I mostly don’t feel that way because when I do feel happy, when I do feel joyful, it’s when I kind of feel the presence of my children and my mom and dad the most.”
PHOTOS: Celebrities We Lost In 2011
While her immediate family was lost in the fire, a large network of extended family and friends has been there to help her deal with the tragedy. A group of more than 100 people, some holding a huge sign of support for Badger with numerous signatures on it, was gathered in Rockefeller Plaza on Thursday.
Seeking a change of scenery to distance herself from the disaster, Badger is currently living in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she said she is surrounded by warmth and support. “These people have showered me with so much love and given me hope,” said the fashion executive. “I never felt judged. I always felt like they were there for me through a million cards and texts and emails and dropping into my house.”
PHOTOS: Celebrity Death Threats
Unable to avoid the holiday season completely while in the U.S., Badger said that she is planning to create a “Santa Claus-free zone” in Thailand at an orphanage for young girls and take them toys that previously belonged to her children.
“Every day is hard – Christmas Day, the first birthdays, Mother’s Day, Easter,” she said. “I’m going to pray and meditate and be with my kids and love them and do the very best I can.”

As previously reported, Madonna’s ex-husband Matthew Badger also expressed the depths of his grief following the fire in a recent interview with New York Magazine, where he confessed that he not only contemplated taking his own life but also killing Madonna and her contractor boyfriend Michael Borcina, whom he holds responsible for the blaze.
“I thought that it was perfectly normal,” Badger said about her ex-husband’s controversial comments. “I would’ve felt the same way. I don’t judge Matthew’s grief. I don’t judge the journey that he’s on, and in fact I’m incredibly proud of him for what he’s done with the Lily Sarah Grace Fund.”

Lisa Rinna & Kim Richards Reignite Their Hatred For Each Other In Brand New RHOBH Sneak Peek!/n

Are we sure it's really 2017 and not just 2015 all over again?
If you were under the impression that Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has fallen into the tired pattern of simply repeating storylines over and over again every season… we're sorry to say: You might be correct.
That's because after getting physical (aka throwing wine glasses) in Amsterdam way back in 2015, Lisa Rinna and Kim Richards are about to reignite their years-old feud during this Tuesday's all-new episode!
Related: Brandi Glanville Calls Rinna Out For Her Bad Wig & Eating Disorder!
Despite getting fired from the show following her multitude of arrests two years ago, Kyle Richards' big sis is set to stop by RHOBH tonight to stir up drama with her soap opera actress nemesis… albeit in a demoted "friend of" capacity.
But while Lisa is clearly the more polite person in the problematic pair… both women get in their fair share of insults during this week's game night based on the 2-minute preview clip alone!
For some reason, when Eileen Davidson starts defending her friendship with Lisa, Kim takes that as an opportunity to call Rinna out for her manipulative ways, saying: 

"I think that [Rinna] uses excuses all the time. Look what you did to me when I was going through all the things that I went through, and you came after me all last year and the year before? And you never really sincerely said you were sorry… You can sit here and use the excuse of losing your parents, but it's ridiculous. You lose someone, it's terrible, but it's no excuse for going around and being mean to Lisa [Vanderpump], myself, Yolanda [Hadid]…"
She's so much more coherent than we remember!

Although, Kim goes on to contradict herself by claiming she never brought up Harry Hamlin during their Netherlands trip, which… is just a flat-out lie.
But that's exactly what causes Rinna to reach her breaking point, screaming:

"You play dirty. Let's talk about your arrest! Why don't we do that?"
RUTHLESS!!
Still, it's nice to see Kim fighting with someone other than her sister for once…

 'How The Mighty Have Fallen': 'Broke' Charlie Sheen Signing Autographs For Paltry $60.../n
Charlie Sheen has lost his luster. Once the highest paid actor on TV, the former Two and a Half Men star has now been reduced to making appearances with other has-beens at the Wizard World fan shows, Radar has learned.
“It’s a case of how the mighty have fallen,” a source told Radar. “Charlie is so down on his luck and flat broke that is has lowered himself to making appearances with other also-rans of TV fame at the Wizard World shows which fans attend to get celebrity autographs.
“He was alongside Lou Ferrigno of the Incredible Hulk, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork of The Monkees, John Barrowman and Nichelle Nichols from Star Trek, and Dean Cain of Superman.”
PHOTOS: 9021-OMG! ‘RHOBH’ Cast Feud Explodes
Sheen, 51, was set to appear at Wizard World this weekend in Minneapolis and Des Moines and Philadelphia in May.
It’s a big comedown for the star who once ruled the sitcom world where he made an incredible $1.8 million dollars a week for Two and a Half Men.
But now “he sits on a stage and signs autographs and earns about $25,000 for each appearance,” said the source.
“Gone are the days of Charlie flying all over the world in his private jet—now he gets one airline ticket and a regular hotel room for his Wizard World gig.”
Even more humiliating, the source said, is that Sheen “gets paid a paltry $60 for an autograph, half as much as KISS Star Gene Simmons gets at $120 per autograph.
PHOTOS: Banged Up! Charlie CAUGHT With Mysterious Bandages On His Wrist & Knee
“Charlie is also appearing alongside the Batmobile from the 60’s TV show and the Flintstone car from the TV series! What a comedown.”
According to the source, baseball fan and memorabilia collector Sheen has been unable to sell his Babe Ruth ring or contract and “has had to lower himself to these upcoming events.”
As Radar readers know, Sheen’s life spiraled out of control after reports of alcohol and drug abuse, marital problems, bizarre public statements, and work meltdowns. CBS and Warner Bros. terminated his Two and a Half Men contract in 2011.
PHOTOS:Bill Cosby Spotted At Court As Sexual Assault Case Begins
Radar followed the “tiger blood” star’s odd behavior and interviews every step of the way.
But worse was to come as in 2015, Radar broke the shocking news of Sheen’s HIV-positive status.
On Friday, Sheen told the Daily Mail Online that his old HIV medication left him with “borderline dementia” but a new experimental drug in a clinical trial has made the bad symptom vanish.
But his career is in shambles!

Anne Hathaway Shares First Photo of Her Son/n

Almost a year after giving birth to her first child, Anne Hathaway is finally ready to let the world meet her son.

The Academy Award winner took to her Instagram on Thursday (March 9, 2017) to share the first photo of her baby boy with husband Adam Shulman. In the sweet picture, Hathaway’s son — named Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman — is seen watching his mother’s speech at the United Nations on a tablet.
“JRS watching Mommy give her speech at the UN yesterday #forourboys #forourgirls #forthefuture #loveislove #parentsareparents #paidparental #iwd #ppl @unwomen,” the 34-year-old captioned the shot.



A post shared by Anne Hathaway (@annehathaway) on Mar 9, 2017 at 7:43am PST



The day before, Hathaway visited the U.N. to give deliver a speech in support of paid parental leave. Wearing a red dress to commemorate International Women’s Day, the actress emphasized the need for companies and businesses to rethink their policies to include men.
“[We need to] redefine and destigmatize men’s roles as caregivers,” Hathaway, who serves as a U.N. global goodwill ambassador, said. “Why do we continue to undervalue fathers and overburden mothers?”
“Maternity leave, or any workplace policy based on gender, can — at this moment in history — only ever be a gilded cage,” she added. “We now know it creates a perception of women as being inconvenient to the workplace. We now know it chains men to an emotionally limited path.”

'Moonlight' Wins Best Picture After Huge Oscars Screwup/nWarren Beatty and Faye Dunaway pulled a Steve Harvey -- announcing  "La La Land " won Best Picture, when it was really supposed to go to  "Moonlight " ... and the fallout was hysterical.  In the greatest Oscars ending ever ... Warren and Faye called the 'La La' crew up onstage -- and they were several minutes into their acceptance speeches before someone figured out the massive screwup. If you missed it you gotta see how it played out -- stage managers looked like Keystone Cops running around onstage. To their credit, the 'La La' folks graciously handed over their Oscars when the  "Moonlight " cast and crew came up. As for what went wrong? Watch ... Warren's explanation is an instant Hollywood classic, but basically he and Faye were handed the wrong card -- the one for Emma Stone's Best Actress win ... which had been handed out just before Best Picture. Price Waterhouse just explained the obvious ...  "The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. " Truth be told, not immediately.  Also, why were there 2  "Best Actress " cards? And get this -- Leo DiCaprio might be unwittingly involved! Best we can tell ... he walked off the stage holding Emma's envelope after her acceptance speech. We don't know what happened backstage, but somehow that card -- or a duplicate of it -- ended up in Warren and Faye's hands. You are not alone, Steve Harvey./n

Kate Winslet & Leonardo DiCaprio Quote Titanic To Each Other When They're Alone!/n

OK, we know Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are friends IRL.
They've been spotted on vacation together, she was there for him when he won his Oscar, he walked her down the aisle when she married Ned Rocknroll…

She revealed: 
"You don't even want to know the last conversation we had, because it was so funny and made me laugh so much. We found ourselves saying to each other, ‘Can you imagine if the world really knew the stupid things we say?' I'm not going to tell you what we actually talk about, but yeah, we're very, very close and sometimes we do quote the odd Titanic line back and forth to each other, because only we can, and we find it really funny."
OMG, we can't believe they really do that!
It's what we've always imagined! We wonder what else we were always right about… Ha!

The mediation is a step forward for Jenelle, who accused her mother of not allowing her to see her son for weeks. She didn’t even have him on Mother’s Day.

Jenelle signed over custody to her mother in 2011 because of her constant trouble with the law.

Bruce Springsteen Lounges and Tans on David Geffen's Yacht /nBruce Springsteen is The Boss wherever he goes ... and that especially applies when he's soaking up some sun aboard the most popular yacht in celebdom. Bruce was seen lounging Wednesday on David Geffen's yacht off the coast of Ibiza -- with his wife, Patti Scialfa﻿, hanging out nearby in a robe. Calvin Klein was also there with his model bf, Kevin Baker. Bruce started out in white swim trunks, but then swapped 'em for a darker pair ... which he eventually yanked up to catch some rays on his thighs. Whoah ohhh ... he's on fire. /n
Betty White Dumps New Boyfriend!/n
Insatiable Betty White has kicked her boyfriend to the curb — because the silver-haired gent couldn’t keep up with the Golden Girl in the bedroom!
The salty 95-year-old TV legend — known for her racy one-liners — has kept the identity of her handsome suitor top secret, even after their fling crashed and burned in April.
“Betty was really into this guy, but after the initial lust period cooled off, she just wasn’t satisfied,” reveals a longtime pal. “She’ll never be a pipe-and-slippers type of girl, and she’s wise enough to accept she has her needs. He was a great guy and madly in love with her, but she wants more than just a doe-eyed companion.”
PHOTOS: 95 & Fabulous! Betty White Emerges From Hiding With Younger Man
As RadarOnline.com reported, the lovebirds were spotted on an intimate evening out in Los Angeles in February. A spy had snitched, “Betty had a twinkle in her eye,” but it seems the spark has been extinguished — along with the sassy star’s interest in the debonair gent.
Betty’s besotted boyfriend didn’t realize he was on thin ice. In fact, friends say he was so head over heels, he was even shopping for an engagement ring — which also doomed the fledgling affair.
“She’ll never remarry, and he was definitely angling toward it,” adds the friend. “She knows her days are numbered, and she just wants to have fun. Men her age, even 20 years younger, are old-fashioned and expect a wife to cook and clean. [That’s] not Betty!”
PHOTOS: Betty White — Through The Years
The national treasure has always maintained her third husband — TV host Allen Ludden — was a hard act to follow. “Once you’ve had the best, who needs the rest?” she told Larry King following Allen’s death from stomach cancer in 1981 after 18 years of wedded bliss.
Betty’s earlier marriages were short-lived affairs in the 1940s, to Dick Barker and then Lane Allen. But to Betty, those relationships were just warm-ups for the real love she found with her third hubby.
“The first two were rehearsals,” she says, and the single star now calls men a “hobby.”
“No guy will ever come close to Allen in her heart,” adds the pal. “She admitted this when she called time on her recent fling. It was hard to do it to someone so late in life, and she never expected to find someone she enjoyed spending so much time with, but her heart’s already been bought and sold.
“She just wants to have no-strings-attached fun.”

Janet Jackson All Smiles as She Leaves Court Hearing Amid Divorce from Estranged Husband/n
Janet Jackson looked to be in high spirits on Friday as she left a London courthouse amid her divorce from Wissam Al Mana.
The 51-year-old singer hugged and kissed members of her legal team after the appearance in England’s high court — along with her entourage, Jackson’s brother Randy accompanied the singer to the hearing.
Meanwhile, Al Mana, 42, ducked out of a side entrance of the building just after the proceedings. The legendary singer and the Qatari businessman split shortly after welcoming their 3-month-old son, Eissa, multiple sources previously confirmed

However, there seems to be no bad blood between the new parents — Al Mana even referred to Jackson as “the most beautiful person in the world” after news of the split broke.

“Janet really trusts Wissam and he trusts her,” a Jackson family friend told PEOPLE exclusively. “She and Wissam are working together to co-parent. They have a strong friendship. There is no fighting between them.”
Janet Jackson Announces Return to World Tour While Addressing Separation from Estranged Husband

Jackson and Al Mana have both been spotted out and about recently bonding separately with little Eissa, with the family friend adding then that the infant is “already on a strict schedule.”
In April, moving trucks were seen taking boxes from the pair’s London townhouse. But a source has told PEOPLE that Jackson will likely remain in London “while the baby is so young.”
Less than a month later, Jackson briefly mentioned the headline-making separation while announcing in a Twitter video that she will be continuing her world tour.
“Yes, I separated from my husband, we are in court and the rest is in God’s hands,” she said in the clip.

Inside President Trump's Rocky Relationship With German Chancellor Angela Merkel/n
Not even winter storm Stella can stop President Donald Trump from going face-to-face with his enemy! President Trump is expected to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, March 17 after their meeting was postponed because of the storm.
President Trump has targeted Merkel by threatening to implement import penalties on German carmakers and criticizing her open-arms refugee policy.
“The German people are going to end up overthrowing this woman,” Trump said in March 2016 regarding a New Year’s Eve incident where migrants were accused of sexual assault. “I don’t know what the hell she is thinking.”
PHOTOS: From Elton John To Donald Trump — Celebrities Pay Tribute To Muhammad Ali
In 2015, the president tweeted that Merkel is “ruining Germany.”
Although their January phone conversation was described as “cordial,” she fought back by criticizing President Trump’s entry ban.
But her jabs didn’t end there. When he called mainstream press the “enemy of the American people,” she fired back in a speech during the Munich Security Conference, “I stand by a free and independent press and have great respect for journalists.”

Despite their differences, Merkel said meeting and having “one-on-one conversations are always much better than talking about each other,” NBC News reported.
Ulf Roeller, a Washington correspondent for German broadcaster ZDF, says her visit proves “how important this trip also is for the White House.”
Trump and Merkel are expected to discuss issues between Russia and the Ukraine, ISIS, international relations and security, the United Nations, climate policies, the European Union as a trade and security partner, and more.

American Horror Story: Cult Is Setting Up a Very Interesting Love Triangle for Sarah Paulson Ryan Murphy may have teased a "love story for the ages" between Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters' characters in the upcoming American Ho.../n
Ryan Murphy may have teased a "love story for the ages" between Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters' characters in the upcoming American Horror Story: Cult, but his character Kai won't be the only one her Ally will be romantically linked to.As Paulson revealed to reporters during the show's panel at the 2017 Television Critics Association summer press tour, Ally will also be married to newcomer Allison Pill's character Ivy Mayfair-Richards!The scoop was revealed in rather roundabout way, as Pill vaguely referred to the occupants of the gorgeous two-story house that's one of this installment's central sets. "There are two women married to each other in that house," she revealed.

"Yeah, but who are they?" Paulson joked before letting the cat out of the bag. "It's me and Allison." As for that love story with Peters? "I think it's going to reveal itself in surprising ways," the actress teased following the panel.The cast and producers remained typically tight-lipped for much of the session, but they did reveal a few more morsels of information. Returning Roanoke star Adina Porter revealed that her character was a "broadcast news journalist." Executive producer Alexis Martin Woodall admitted that the installment's much-talked about connection to the 2016 presidential election was "more about what's going on in the world around us...[a] streak of paranoia."And when asked for some words to describe a plot that's been so fiercely guarded, Woodall had this to say: "We've got bloody tension, a well-cooked meal, an exciting trip to a grocery store. I just think it is true to our brand, which is you're going to be in a whole new world all over again and fall in love with these really special characters and hate yourself for watching it right before you go to bed and love yourself in the morning for making it through the night."For everything else we know about Cult thus far, be sure to read on!

Anthony Scaramucci Out As White House Communications Director (UPDATE)/n12:08 PM PT -- The Press Secretary has just released a statement, saying,  "Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House Communications Director. Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team. We wish him all the best. " That's a wrap for Anthony Scaramucci -- he's officially out as White House Communications Director after only 10 days on the job. There are conflicting reports as to whether Donald Trump fired him or if Mooch tendered his own resignation -- but the bottom line is he's done. The move comes just days after his profanity-laced interview with a New Yorker reporter in which he trashed Reince Priebus as a  "paranoid schizophrenic " and had some explicit insults for Steve Bannon. The 53-year-old is also going through a divorce.  Scaramucci's time as Communications Director is believed to be the shortest run in White House history.  It's shorter than Kim Kardashian's marriage to Kris Humphries (72 days). It's shorter than the run of  "Doubt " on CBS (2 weeks). It's shorter than Conan O'Brien's tenure on 'The Tonight Show' (7 months). It's shorter than El Chapo's time on the run after escaping prison (7 months). It's shorter than the time the Chilean miners spent trapped (69 days). It's LONGER than Carmen Electra's marriage to Dennis Rodman (9 days)./n

'Homeland' Star Morena Baccarin -- Real Marriage Blows Up Too and It Could Cost Her $$$/nMorena Baccarin -- Nicholas Brody's estranged wife on ﻿ "Homeland " -- is headed for divorce off-screen too -- and all her success since the Showtime hit could work against her in the split. Baccarin’s writer /director husband, Austin Chick, filed the divorce docs, citing irreconcilable differences, after 3 and a half years of marriage -- a lifetime in Hollywood. According to the docs, Chick wants joint custody of their one-year-old son ... and he wants spousal support. It looks like Baccarin's been the breadwinner in the fam -- picking up roles on hits like  "Gotham " and  "The Flash " -- so, at least on paper, she'll likely end up forking over some amount of cash. Did we mention she's banging Det. Jim Gordon on  "Gotham? " 'Cause she is ... and she looks freakin' hot doing it. /n
Michelle Branch Is Engaged to Patrick Carney—See Her Art Deco Ring!/n
Double the celebration!
Michelle Branch‘s 34th birthday Sunday came with cake — and a proposal. The musician revealed Monday that her boyfriend of two years, Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney, popped the question over dessert.
“Thank you for all the birthday love and wishes. Last night, right before I blew out my candles, Patrick asked me to marry him and then I had nothing left to wish for … 34 might be the best year yet,” Branch captioned a photo of her Art Deco engagement ring and her birthday cake.
The couple met in February 2015 at a Grammys party in Los Angeles. They soon began writing and recording together — they coproduced her latest album, Hopeless Romantic — and fell in love along the way.





 Thank you for all the birthday love and wishes. Last night, right before I blew out my candles, @officerpatrickcarney asked me to marry him and then I had nothing left to wish for ✨❤️ 34 might be the best year yet.
A post shared by Michelle Branch (@michellebranch) on Jul 3, 2017 at 10:50am PDT







 Happy birthday to my main squeeze @michellebranch I'll be on the road with her all summer and available for salad recipe exchanges!!!! Come check it out.
A post shared by Patrick Carney (@officerpatrickcarney) on Jul 1, 2017 at 11:06pm PDT


The same year they met, Branch weathered a public divorce from her bassist ex-husband Teddy Landau, the father of her 11-year-old daughter Owen. Carney, 37, was previously married to Emily Ward and Denise Grollmus.
In April, Branch told PEOPLE her relationship with Carney and their family dynamic was a lot “like Modern Family.” She and daughter Owen moved in with Carney in Nashville.
“I’d never had someone who was that supportive. He’s an amazing, amazing human,” Branch said of her now-fiancé. “We both just jumped in with both feet.”

Gabourey Sidibe Responds to Body Shamers on Janet Mock Podcast: ‘You Don’t Care About My Health’/n

 
Gabourey Sidibe won’t stand for any criticism about her body.
The actress is a guest on the latest episode of Janet Mock’s podcast “Never Before” where she calls out people who masquerade body shaming as concern for her health.
“People pretend that they care about my health by calling me a fat disgusting b—-,” Sidibe, 34, says. “You do not care about my health. You are just a giant a—–. And you think that you can have an opinion about me — but this is my body. I’m not out here in these streets writing think pieces about how your d— is too small.”
The actress also discusses how she’s been stereotyped after her Oscar-nominated breakthrough role in Precious. Sidibe says that film executives constantly look to cast her in similar parts because that’s how she’s known — and now she wants to avoid being stereotyped.
“All they know of me is what they saw. All they know of me is Precious,” she says. “As a woman and as a black person, you know that what they see of us and what we actually are is very different. They’ll see an example. They’ll see a cartoon of us and assume that that’s all of us.”

Sidibe, who admitted to PEOPLE she has struggled with her appearance since the age of 6, underwent laproscopic bariatric surgery last year after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes because she “didn’t want to worry about all the effects that go along with” it. Still, the actress has consistently fought back against people who tear her down for her weight — and is finally in a place where she loves who she is.
“There’s nothing ugly about me,” she says. “I was in a war with my body for a long time. If I’d started treating it better sooner, I wouldn’t have spent so many years hating myself. But I love my body now.”
Sidibe is the latest in a lineup of strong women to appear on Mock’s podcast, which is part of Lena Dunham‘s LENNY. With the Girls actress as executive producer, Mock has also sat down with Congresswoman Maxine Waters and Beyoncé’s mom Tina Knowles-Lawson.

7 Shocking Confessions From Lance Armstrong During His Howard Stern Show Interview Lance Armstrong isn't riding away from any topic these days.  While the former professional cyclist has been staying away from the Hollywood spotlight in.../n
Lance Armstrong isn't riding away from any topic these days. While the former professional cyclist has been staying away from the Hollywood spotlight in recent months, the athlete couldn't turn down the opportunity to be interviewed by Howard Stern.During Monday's episode of The Howard Stern Show, Lance was asked personal questions including his past relationship with Sheryl Crow.At the same time, he couldn't help but reveal new information about his life as a cyclist before and after the doping scandal.Take a look at seven of the many fascinating topics discussed during today's SiriusXM radio show. What you read and hear may surprise you.

Reacting to Dope Scandal: When Lance admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs for the first time publicly, a whole new level of scrutiny began. Ultimately, the athlete was worried about how his kids would react to the attention. "That's not a one-time conversation. The older kids were old enough to kind of live it with me and there was that conversation and there was therapy," he explained to Howard. "There was work. It's a process." While Lance is in a "great place" with all of his children today, his younger kids may be hearing stuff from their classmates soon. "The younger ones are growing into it. My seven and six year old were alive, but they didn't watch Oprah," he explained. "Now they're old enough where some kids in school can [ask questions]."

Loving Sheryl Crow: More than 10 years after Lance and Sheryl ended their engagement, fans are still curious to learn more about the relationship. To this day, the cyclist still has nice things to say about his ex. "It was a good ride. She's a great lady. Obviously it didn't work out, but I think and I hope she's happy. I'm happy," he shared. "It's tough to pull it off. I mean, how many couples have been able to pull it off? To her credit, she was a stay-at-home—one of the biggest rock stars—she was a great partner. She was at the races…it wasn't like we never saw each other."

Trusting in Oprah: Out of all the TV personalities and journalists in the world, Lance decided to sit down with Oprah Winfrey and confess his mistakes. Looking back, the cyclist wonders if it was all too much at the time. "It was too soon for a lot of people and too detailed and too shocking for a lot of people," Lance explained. "The reason I decided to sit with her is because I had an existing relationship with her and I like Oprah and I trust her, but I knew I was going to get sued. When the report came out and they striped the titles, I f--king knew they were lining up." To this day, Lance believes Oprah was sympathetic while also feeling pressure from journalists to ask the tough questions. "It had to happen," he shared. "I left there feeling wow this is pretty good and the reaction was brutal."

Saying No to Bikes: After making front-page headlines for not the best reasons, Lance admitted that he fell out of love with the cycling sport. "For three or four years, I hated cycling because of what my life has looked like for the last four or five years," he explained. "Just like with any kind of breakup, there are hard feelings." Lance decided to purse sports he grew up doing like swimming and running. In the last six months, however, he started biking again and is falling in love all over again.

Lance's Parental Figures: During his interview, Howard brought up Lance's home life as a child. As it turns out, the athlete was never able to meet his biological dad. A few years ago, Lance got a call that his father passed away after being bit by a spider. As of now, Lance doesn't know if he regrets not finding his dad. When he gets older, however, his perspective may change.

Peeing While Racing: On a much lighter note, Howard had to ask his guest one very important question: How do you tinkle when you are racing for hours nonstop? "Anybody at that level knows how to pee off the bike," Lance shared. "There are periods where there is no people [around]. You know what to do, teammate gives you a push from behind.""Generally, the entire group will just say, 'Anybody need to take a leak?' and everybody will stop so that gives you an opportunity," Lance continued. Who knew?

So True? So False? Is Mary-Louise Parker Replacing Demi Moore in Linda Lovelace Biopic?! While we're getting over the bombshell release of the Demi Moore 911 call, there's another related story that's been making the rounds to.../n
While we're getting over the bombshell release of the Demi Moore 911 call, there's another related story that's been making the rounds today.Namely, according to reports, that producers of Lovelace, the Linda Lovelace biopic starring Amanda Seyfried currently shooting in L.A., are in talks with Mary-Louise Parker about subbing for Demi Moore in the role of feminist icon Gloria Steinem. Moore dropped out following her headline-grabbing hospitalization on Monday.Well, E! News has done some digging and can definitely say this rumor is...

MORE: Demi Moore Released From Hospital As Ashton Kutcher Returns to L.A.

So false! At least for the moment."At this time Mary-Louise is not set for this role," her rep tells E! News. Producers, meanwhile, declined to comment on the Parker-as-replacement reports.The casting problem emerged when the 49-year-old Moore was hospitalized for what her rep said was "exhaustion" following a night of partying that saw the star begin convulsing after "smoking something." She dropped out of the film and sent filmmakers scrambling to find an appropriate fill-in.As it happens, the Weeds star is in between seasons of Showtime's hit series. And it's worth noting her publicist didn't exactly refute reports she's in negotiations, so she very well might end up in the role.If she did come aboard, Parker would round out a cast that already includes James Franco, Peter Sarsgaard, Sharon Stone, Chloe Sevigny and Eric Roberts.That's not to be confused with Inferno: A Linda Lovelace Story, a rival film about the Deep Throat star, which once had Lindsay Lohan set to play the titular character until legal problems scratched the deal. Malin Ackerman subsequently took over the part.—Reporting by Sharareh Drury

Ted Cruz Divorce Bombshell! Read The Explosive Court Filing/n
Presidential candidate Ted Cruz is busy fighting off reports of a cheating scandal and being a linked to a notorious DC madam. Now, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned pals fear his marriage could soon implode, just like his parents did several years ago!
Legal documents obtained exclusively by Radar show that the candidate’s father, Rafael Cruz, filed for divorce from his wife, Eleanor Cruz, in July 1996.
READ THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS
At the time, Ted, the couple’s only child, was 26-years-old.
Rafael wrote in his petition for divorce from his wife of 27 years, “The marriage has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities…that destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation.”
After the couple’s property was divided, including a 1998 Toyota and their marital residence in Houston, their divorce was finalized on Feb. 13, 1997. Eleanor quickly dropped her husband’s last name and went back to her maiden name of Darragh.

The end of his parents’ long marriage doesn’t bode well for scandal-plagued politician Ted. As Radar reported, Ted, 45, was recently accused of hiding secrets from his wife, Heidi, including alleged flings with five different mistresses.
An insider claimed, “If Ted doesn’t work things out in his marriage, he could be headed for divorce and he has a lot more to lose than his father did almost 20 years ago.“ /n

Matt Bomer is coming to American Horror Story: Freak Show.
Bomer will appear on the “Pink Cupcakes” episode of the FX anthology series, airing November 5, and courtesy of Out Magazine, we’ve got the first look at Matt on the show.

Matt will share the screen with Michael Chiklis, who plays the show’s resident strong man, and Dandy Motts, portrayed by the series’ breakout star Finn Wittrock.
“[He’s in] maybe one of the most disturbing things we’ve ever done and a true horror scene,” creator Ryan Murphy revealed.
Like most American Horror Story guest starring roles, there is no real information as to what sort of character Matt will be playing, but given the life expectancy of most guest stars on the show, his character on the episode may not even make it through the whole episode.
Bomer has previously appeared on Ryan Murphy’s Glee and The New Normal in addition to his Emmy Award-nominated turn in this summer’s HBO adaptation of Larry Kramer’s The Normal Heart.
Yesterday, it was officially confirmed that Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka will also be appearing in the final episodes of the season, as well as frequent American Horror Story actress Lily Rabe, who will be reprising her Season 2 Asylum role of Sister Mary Eunice.

Elton Feels Love for Madge/n
Can you feel the love tonight? It looks like Elton John is finally ready to apologize to Madonna after recently calling out the Material Girl for lip-synching. "I don't want to escalate it because I like Madonna," the 57-year-old singer-songwriter tells the Nov. 6 issue of Entertainment Weekly. "She's been to my house for dinner. It was something that was said in the heat of the moment, and probably should not have been said." John's barbed comments, made Oct. 4 at a London music awards show, sparked headlines around the world--causing many to wonder if John had a feud with Madonna. However, John feels that uproar over his comments were overblown by the media. "The reaction to it was so hysterical," he says. "It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on." Elton further explained the incident recently on a New Zealand television show. On the show, the Brit confessed he made his remarks because "I have a bee in my bonnet about live shows." "It was in the context of a very drunken lunch. Sometimes when you say something and then it's written down on paper, it looks totally different," he offered up in his defense. Still, the "Candle in the Wind" singer apparently wishes to set the record straight with his pal, sometimes known as Esther. "Would I apologize to her if I saw her?" says John in EW. "Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers." Only John could manage to offend more singers with an apology to one. By "bloody teenage singers," we can only assume John's is referring to recent lip-synching champion Ashlee Simpson--who was just busted big time on Saturday Night Live for using vocal tracks. (The latest development: a 60 Minutes camera crew happened to be backstage during the SNL meltdown and captured the reaction; the segment will air on this week's installment.) Or perhaps he means Britney Spears. Regardless, John's new statements prove the "Bitch Is Back" singer can still bitch with the best of 'em. For her part, Madonna is apparently not losing much sleep over the comments, or the forthcoming mea culpa. Shortly after John's dissing, Madonna's spokeswoman, Liz Rosenberg, released a statement saying the pop queen "does not lip-synch nor does she spend her time trashing other artists." However, Rosenberg revealed that Madonna doesn't hold a grudge against comments made by a loose-lipped John. "Elton John remains on her Christmas card list whether he is nice...or naughty," Rosenberg said. John certainly didn't feel the need to hold back on his opinions of the Taiwanese media last month. He caused an arguably much bigger uproar Sept. 23 when he called Taiwanese paparazzi "rude, vile pigs." John apologized to the Taiwanese people for his comments at his concert the next night in Taipei--but the singer did not withdraw the comments directed towards the shutterbugs. John's new release, Peachtree Road, drops Nov. 9.

Black Church Set On Fire With Message To 'Vote Trump' — Authorities Confirm 'Hate Crime' Investigation/n

This is beyond incredibly disturbing.
Late Tuesday night, authorities responded to a predominantly black church in Mississippi which had been badly burned and vandalized.
To make matters even more upsetting, the building had "Vote Trump" scrawled across a wall, which suggests this was a politically motivated hate crime by supporters of Donald Trump. You know, Trump supporters like these guys.
VOTE 2016: Who The Celebs Support For President!
In response to the disgusting vandalism, Greenville Mayor Errick D. Simmons stated: 

"This matter is being investigated as a hate crime. This act is a direct assault of people's right to freely worship. Moreover, this matter is being investigated with all deliberate speed and we will not rest until the culprit is found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
Well, we're glad the authorities are taking this case seriously. Hopefully they'll be able to identify and then prosecute the perps responsible for this heinous crime.
Unfortunately, this incident of arson comes on the heels of many racist comments made by Trump and his supporters. Some democrats have gone on to allege that Trump supporters have been encouraged to intimidate minority voters come election day.
The only shred of humanity left in this story is that prominent lawmakers are NOT tolerating this disgusting act.
Congressman Bennie Thompson wrote:

"Last evening, Hopewell M.B. Church in Greenville, MS, was burned and defaced in what was a deeply shocking and saddening event that harkens back to a much darker day in Mississippi. I am very concerned about this heinous crime and will urge federal government agencies to coordinate with state and local law enforcement to utilize every resource at their disposal to investigate this incident and bring the perpetrator to justice. The political message of the vandalism is obviously an attempt to sway public opinion regarding the upcoming election. I encourage all citizens not to be deterred by this cowardly act and exercise your right to vote at the ballot box."
And Governor Phil Bryant tweeted:

Those responsible will answer for this despicable crime against people of faith. We expect a suspect will be ID'ed and brought to justice. https://t.co/vGwzNddTWd

Electric Daisy Carnival Sued, My Son Died from Ecstasy Because Festival Wasn't Prepared/nThe Electric Daisy Carnival was grossly unprepared for medical emergencies, and as a result, a 24-year-old man died after taking Ecstasy ... according to his father, who's now suing Live Nation and the festival's founder. Nicholas Tom attended the annual 3-day festival in Las Vegas back in 2015. His father, Terry Tom, admits Nicholas popped Ecstasy during the concert -- and in 110 degree heat -- had a seizure and started foaming at the mouth. In the suit, Mr. Tom says good Samaritans came to Nicholas's aid ... carrying him around looking for a medical tent, which took more than 30 minutes. Once they did, he claims volunteer staffers had no medical experience, and the actual medics had  "their hands full and were unavailable. " He says Nicholas died on the floor of the medical tent. According to the suit, festival organizers are well aware concertgoers take drugs, especially Ecstasy. Mr. Tom says at least one person has died each year at EDC events put on by the defendants, dating back to 2006. In fact, one man died just this past weekend at EDC Las Vegas. Tom says EDC should have had proper medical services, trained medical staff, and abundant water for the festival which was attended by 135,000 people. He's suing for wrongful death and negligence.

 Aaron Hernandez Fiancée Claims She 'Can't Remember' Details Of Murder Night — 'I Was.../n
Aaron Hernandez’s fiancée was expected to be a bombshell witness for the prosecution after she was granted immunity following many weeks of haggling. But in her first day on the stand, she insisted she couldn’t remember key details related to the murder case — including whether a gun she saw in a kitchen drawer looked like the weapon prosecutors contend the ex-NFL star used to kill Odin Lloyd.
Lloyd, whose bullet-riddled body was found in the early morning hours of June 17, 2013, was the boyfriend of Jenkins’ sister. She said she is “estranged, sort of,” from her sister now.
Jenkins proved to be a reluctant witness for the prosecution, often answering “I don’t remember” when asked about events the night Lloyd, 27, was shot to death at a construction site near the home she shared with the former New England Patriots player Hernandez.
“I was drunk that night,” Jenkins, 25, insisted at one point.
PHOTOS: Celebs Involved in Murder
Jenkins, who has been charged with lying 29 times to a grand jury, was forced to testify in Hernandez’s murder trial Friday because the judge granted her immunity for whatever she says that contradicts her earlier testimony. She seemed to stand by her man and much of her story, even mouthing the words “love you!” as she looked toward the defense table. Her large diamond engagement ring constantly flashed from the witness stand.
When a black Glock handgun was placed on the witness stand in front of Jenkins, she acknowledged it was the same color and shape as the alleged murder weapon, but balked when asked if it was the same size. “I’m not sure,” she replied.
She was also reluctant to confirm that the gun she saw in her “junk drawer” looked like a black object seen in Hernandez’s hand in a video recorded by a security camera in her home minutes after the alleged murder. Jenkins said she saw “only a black blob” on the grainy video.

Did she see anything in his hands before he and two men also charged in the killing left their home before the killing? “I don’t remember,” Jenkins replied after a long pause. “I was drunk that night,” she said. Jenkins testified that she and Hernandez drank a lot of alcohol at a bar just hours earlier. “We were both sort of intoxicated.”
Jenkins, who is seen on security video carrying a large box from her home the next day, testified that the only thing Hernandez asked her to do the next morning was “to wash a shirt, I think it was.” She said she could not remember what shirt it was he wanted washed.
Jenkins was first questioned without the jury present so Judge Susan Garsh could preview how she might answer key questions she allegedly lied about earlier. The prosecution is barred from asking her a question if they believe in advance she will not tell the truth.
PHOTOS: Most Notorious American Murder Trials
Did she ask Hernandez if he killed Lloyd? the prosecutor asked. “I asked him if he did and he said ‘No,’ and that was the extent of our conversation,” she answered.
Jenkins will return to the witness stand for more testimony on Monday.
Prosecutors contend the former New England Patriots tight end organized the murder with help from associates Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who have also pleaded not guilty.

Hernandez has also pleaded not guilty to murder charges in a separate 2012 double killing. That trial is set for May.
A male juror was dismissed from the jury as court began Friday “for reasons that are personal to the juror,” the judge announced. He was the third juror dismissed since the trial began in January, leaving 15 people on the panel which requires at least 12 for a verdict. /n
Sponsors Pull Funding From Play That Shows The Murder Of A Donald Trump-Like Julius Caesar/n

UPDATE 8:27 P.M. EST: The Public Theater responded to the controversy on Monday with the following statement:

"We stand completely behind our production of 'Julius Caesar.' We recognize that our interpretation of the play has provoked heated discussion; audiences, sponsors and supporters have expressed varying viewpoints and opinions. Such discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater; this discourse is the basis of a healthy democracy. Our production of 'Julius Caesar' in no way advocates violence towards anyone. Shakespeare's play, and our production, make the opposite point: those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save. For over 400 years, Shakespeare's play has told this story and we are proud to be telling it again in Central Park."

Directed by Kathy Griffin?
A production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar has come under fire for putting a Donald Trump spin on the titular role — who just so happens to get assassinated.
The New York-based arts organization put Trump look-alike Gregg Henry in the starring role, which saw Caesar as a bombastic businessman who wore long red ties and had a wife with a Melania Trump-esque Slavic accent.
Related: Melania Has Officially Moved Into The White House
The play will open on Monday at The Delacorte Theater in Central Park, but early previews are already enraging some sensitive theatergoers — because in the play, Roman senators stab Caesar to death out of fear he's getting too power hungry!
Needless to say, not everyone was happy to see a POTUS-like Caeser get assassinated during NYC's Free Shakespeare in the Park, and sponsors were quick to respond as well.
On Sunday, Delta Airlines pulled its funding of the theater group in response to the spiraling criticism. The company said the theater "crossed the line" in a statement, writing: 
"No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of ‘Julius Caesar' at this summer's Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines' values. Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. We have notified them of our decision to end our sponsorship as the official airline of the Public Theater effective immediately."
Bank of America soon followed suit, saying that it was, too, "withdrawing our funding for this production." However, the company will still retain its funding of the theater.

Even though Trump's name is never mentioned in the production, the Public Theater intentionally chose to present — and murder — Julius Caesar in a way that would provoke and offend.
Based on the stunned reaction to the on stage murder of the President, it looks like the company got exactly what it was hoping for.
Do U think this play takes Trump trolling too far?

Bobbi Kristina Brown's Aunt Claims Someone 'Intended' for Her to Drown/n
One week after publicly claiming that Nick Gordon is under investigation for “attempted murder” in connection with the near-drowning of Whitney Houston’s daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, Bobbi Kristina’s aunt, Leolah Brown, told TMZ that Whitney’s sister-in-law, Pat Houston, also “has a lot to do” with Kristina’s condition.  
“I believe that she has a lot to do with it. Whether it be her actual hand, I can’t say that right now,” Brown said in a video published Sunday. “But I hold her accountable for what happened to my niece, Bobbi Kristina, because of what knowledge I have of her.”  
She added, “It was someone’s intention to put [Bobbi Kristina] where she is right now. That I do believe.”  
Brown had harsh words for both Pat and Gordon, Kristina’s 25-year-old boyfriend, who has been publicly feuding with Kristina’s family since she was found unconscious in the couple’s home on Jan. 31.  
Police have previously confirmed to PEOPLE that they have launched an investigation into 22-year-old’s near-drowning, but did not confirm if they’re investigating Gordon specifically.  
“I believe Nick is manipulating Dr. Phil just like he manipulated my niece Bobbi Kristina, that is what he’s doing,” she continued. “His habits and his actions are not conducive nor are they consistent with anyone that is concerned for somebody.”  
Gordon appeared on The Dr. Phil Show on March 11, in an interview-turned-intervention. Sources told PEOPLE that Gordon was “distraught” following Kristina’s hospitalization and entered rehab following the taping.  
Brown also told TMZ she blames Pat for not allowing Kristina time to heal following her mother’s 2012 death – instead convincing her to appear on a reality series.  
“You’re a money-hungry beast, Pat, yes you are,” Brown said. “And the world knows who you are.”

Chris Penn Found Dead/nBy PAUL CHAVEZ , ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITERChris Penn, a younger brother of Sean Penn  who played supporting roles in films such as  "Reservoir Dogs " and   "Starsky & Hutch, " was found dead in his Santa Monica home,  authorities said. Police do not suspect foul play. Penn's body was discovered in bed inside the condominium on  Ocean Avenue, said Capt. Ed Winter of the county coroner's office.  He said the actor's housekeeper called authorities.  There were no obvious signs of foul play, Lt. Frank Fabrega  said. Autopsy results were pending. Police said Penn was 40 years  old, though several celebrity Web sites list his age as 43.   "The Penn family would appreciate the media's respect of their  privacy during this difficult time, " Mara Buxbaum, Sean Penn's  publicist, said in a statement.  Chris Penn's credits included  "Rumble Fish, "  "All the Right  Moves, "  "Footloose, "  "Rush Hour, "  "Corky Romano " and   "Starsky & Hutch. " He also played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot in the  1992 Quentin Tarantino crime drama  "Reservoir Dogs. "  Although he was not as well known as his brother Sean, 45,  critics said he often was underrated.   "Just as talented as Sean -- just a lot less cocky, " Slate  magazine critic Cintra Wilson wrote of him last year. He  "makes  you seamlessly believe in characters so much you barely even notice  them. "  Penn's late father, Leo Penn, directed television shows. His  mother, Eileen Ryan, is an actress whose credits include  "I Am  Sam, "  "Magnolia " and  "Parenthood. " His brother is musician  Michael Penn. Chris Penn's latest film,  "The Darwin Awards, " was scheduled  to premiere Wednesday at the Sundance Film Festival. The film also  stars Joseph Fiennes, Winona Ryder and David Arquette/n
 EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: 16 And Pregnant Ashley's Adoption Choice: 'I Suffer Every Day For.../n
Ashley Salazar from MTV’s 16 and Pregnant made the heart wrenching decision to give up her baby Callie for adoption to her aunt and uncle.
PHOTOS: Ashley Salazar And Baby Callie
And now, one year later, she has opened up exclusively to RadarOnline.com about the difficulties she has faced since her painful choice and her advice to new mothers experiencing the same challenges.
Radar: You made a mature but very heart wrenching decision to put your baby up for adoption, how confident are you that made the right choice?
Ashley: I honestly don’t think that I will ever be 100 percent confident in my decision. I suffer every day for it. Some days, I am right back to square one, feeling like I did in the hospital; confused, depressed, and uncertain. The only thing that I am confident in is that she is taken care of every day and has everything she not only needs, but could ever want, as well.
Radar: You kept a very personal detailed account of your pregnancy with both photos and a blog. When you gave birth and finally opted for adoption, did you miss the process you became so involved in?
Ashley: I definitely did, and I definitely do miss the documentation. I loved being able to document something that meant so much to me, especially since I am confident when I say that this pregnancy was the most meaningful and positive life changing experience that I will ever have in my life.
PHOTOS: Cutest Celebrity Kids
Radar: How do you think your life would be different today had you not gone through with the adoption?
Ashley: I think I might have been a tad bit happier, but the stress would have canceled some of that happiness out. When I find out about all the expenses that my aunt and uncle have to take on, I feel relief. I do know, though, that Callie and I would have been just fine and happy together, but at what cost? I would never be around.
Radar: She just had her first birthday, how did she spend her day?
Ashley: My aunt and uncle had Callie’s actual party two days after with family. I could have flown down, but they were last minute circumstances. I saw a video of the party on YouTube and my mom Skype’d with her. They are saving a slice of cake and my present so we can open it and eat some cake together.
PHOTOS: Megan And Baby Blake
Radar: You recently got to see Callie, what was that like for you?
Ashley: Well, I see her every few months. This last time, when she was almost a year old, she just changed so much – in her appearance especially. I couldn’t handle the initial encounter, and I literally just instantly left and broke down outside in the street.  I just pushed all negative feelings aside the following day and enjoyed the time I am so blessed to be able to spend with her.
Radar: What is she doing now?
Ashley: She’s so smart. She’s a good problem solver. She’s walking – trying to – and saying small words. She’s a good eater, loves to laugh, and have fun.
Radar: Have you made plans as to what you will tell her about the adoption when she is old enough?
Ashley: I think we will just cross that when we get there. I’m not sure what the specific words will be. My aunt and uncle have repeatedly told me that they will in fact tell her the truth about the adoption and they are constantly showing her pictures and talking to her. They also want to come up with a special name that she will call me, not “Ashley.”
PHOTOS: Stars Who Have Adopted Children
Radar: What are your future plans for school?
Ashley: I left New York City. I’m just going to continue my schooling in Texas. I’m not going to stop school. I’m going to do what I need to do and make Callie proud. That’s it.
Radar: I read you will be moving – will you get to see Callie more often?
Ashley: Yes, I’m so relieved. I will definitely see her. Circumstances have suddenly brightened when the distance between us is a car ride as opposed to a plane flight. I can take off any time.
Radar: What would be your advice to young teens who are considering adoption?
Ashley: Wow, I could write a speech… Think long and hard about what you really want. Weigh out your options – pros and cons. Think long and hard about what you want for your child, first of all. Try not to be so biased when your feelings get in the way, and try not to listen so much to other peoples’ inputs. It’s not worth it. It’s too confusing. You and of course, your child, are what matter the most. Lastly, I’m going to be honest, because I believe that teens need to know this before hand: adoption hurts like hell. It could possibly destroy you for a while. You won’t be able to sleep. You won’t be able to eat. You won’t be able to look at other babies, and there will be days you might feel like you can’t go on living. If you aren’t going to see your child regularly, I wouldn’t recommend bonding with it for 48 hours in the hospital like I did. Depressing, I know, but it gets better. There’s always a light at the end of the tunnel. Most of all, do what you think is best for your child. Your child comes before you always. If you are religious, pray and pray.
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: 16 And Pregnant’s Markai – ‘My Story Is Intense!’
Radar: How do you feel this experience has most affected your life?
Alexis: Again, I could write a novel. I think I have changed for the better. I still need a lot of therapy, and I want to fix myself. I don’t feel like I even had a baby. Things are still so blurry to me. I am, though, forever grateful, and I realized how blessed I really am (I could cry) to have the family that I do. I couldn’t imagine having had to give Callie to strangers. I really don’t know what I want to do in life, but everything is for Callie. The only thing do I know for sure is that I am more ambitious. Callie made me want to make something of myself the moment that I found out I was pregnant. My beautiful girl is my rock, my light, and my inspiration for everything I do. I cease to exist without her.

EXCLUSIVE! Justin Hartley Spills on His Smallville Directorial Debut and His Favorite Lois & Clark Scene Most actors are double threats. They can act and sing. Or they can act and write their own episodes. Or walk and chew gum at the sam.../n
Most actors are double threats. They can act and sing. Or they can act and write their own episodes. Or walk and chew gum at the same time. (We kid!) Anyway, Smallville's Justin Hartley is doubling up as well with directing and acting. And the world will see his directorial debut in tonight's episode, "Dominion."When we got him on the phone to talk about being behind the camera and in front of it, he wasn't afraid to admit it was a tough job. No sugarcoating here. That's one of many reasons why we adore him. Need more reasons? Plus swoonworthy Chloe, Lois and Clark info? All you have to do is read on:

Q&A: Smallville's Justin HartleyWhat can you tell us about "Dominion," tonight's episode?Justin Hartley: I can tell you that I directed it. The story is in the beginning we find out that something happened in the Phantom Zone. Clark (Tom Welling) is the only one who can go into the Phantom Zone and fix the problem, but once he comes back out of the Phantom Zone, of course, everything goes to hell. Oliver cons his way into the Phantom Zone when Clark says, 'Don't go, it's dangerous.' Now the two of them up being stuck in the Phantom Zone, and they have to work together to figure out a way out. We find out a lot about trust and where their trust lies with each other and within themselves. [There's] a really touching scene at the end between Lois and Clark. Zod (Callum Blue) comes back.So, tons going on. A lot for a first-time director.I got lucky. I got a really great script. I got great people to work with, I got great stories for our leads. And I got a lot of help from everyone so hopefully everyone likes it.Was it difficult being behind the camera and in front of the camera at the same time?Difficult, but I found a sweet spot. I talked to my assistant director Sandra, and I was like, 'Sandra, here's what I want to do. When I'm in front of the camera I really need someone else to call 'action' and 'cut' because I can't be in the scene.' Thinking about when I should end the scene at the same time...it's impossible.



Jack Rowand/The CW

Did you have any favorite scenes while directing?There   was a scene between Lois and Clark at the very end, and I really liked   it. It wasn't the easiest scene we shot. It was really long, and it was   really dramatic. There was a lot going on. I had to put Erica Durance in an uncomfortable spot. I really enjoyed working with her  and giving  her these tiny little nuggets; she was like a piece of  putty. It was  like whatever I said to her, she could do, and that was  amazing to me.  She had all this trust in me without holding back, and I  think she's  going to be extremely happy when she sees it. She's  terrific in that  last scene. She's really good.What about your fight scenes in the episode?We sort of broke my stunt double about five episodes ago, so we had to have these other guys come in, and they're hard matches. They are great at what they do but they don't match—I had to do a lot of my own stuff. I think I did every single thing that'll you'll see. It was exhausting because you're using you're brain at a pace you're not used to using at, and then you're using your body at a pace you're not used to using it at. And you're trying to talk to everyone else to answer their questions, That was challenging but I loved it.Anything you didn't like about directing?There really wasn't a moment that I didn't like. I don't like the board meetings. I don't like sitting in a room with people talking about what we're going to do. It's necessary evil but I'm not a big fan. It's hard not to fall asleep during those things. They just go on forever, but it was fun, and it was worth it, and hopefully I can do it again.Can you talk about Oliver's journey for the rest of the season?He   has this Omega planted in his soul, this quote-unquote "darkness" that's   inside of him. And the interesting thing is here is this guy who has   dedicated his life to stopping this thing and now he's got it inside of   him. His whole journey from here on out is how to get that out of his   body, if that's even possible. Keep in mind at one point this guy was   suicidal, so in my preparation, I was thinking that's got to be on his   mind. That's one way to get rid of it. So there's that journey of will   he fall back into that dark place and become this guy who is so self   destructive it's sad? Or will he overcome it? Can he overcome it?Chloe (Alison Mack) and Oliver are a fan-favorite couple. What is it about you two that works so well?Obviously,   it has a lot to do with the way it was written. I think it has just as   much to do with the actors. That sounds really, really selfish  but—it's  not all me it's all her. Allison's got this way of working  with people  no matter what they give her. If you are able to give her  whatever you  have, what you're going to come out with is amazing. A lot  of the stuff  that works between Chloe and Oliver, I think it has to do  with Allison  and Justin. We work really well together. She's a really  good actress,  she's fun, and she's always in a good mood. We have a lot  of chemistry  in our scenes. I think because we respect the work so  much and we work  on it. It's important to both of us.

Rihanna is moving on up.

The singer recently splashed out $6.8 million on a six-bedroom, nine-bathroom mansion in West Hollywood, the same neighborhood where Kendall Jenner just moved away from due to numerous break-ins at her house.
Via TMZ:
Sources close to the deal tell TMZ … Rihanna recently purchased the crib above the Sunset Strip for a cool $6.8 million. It’s got 6 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms and just over 7,000 square feet of space. There’s also a movie theater inside, a fully equipped gym, a fireplace, a billiard room and a guest house … plus a pool and a huge yard.
It’s also gated … which could come in handy around those parts.

Bye, Boo! 'OITNB' Star Lea DeLaria Splits With Fiancée/n
Lea DeLaria is single!
The Orange is the New Black star who plays Big Boo announced that she and her fiancée, fashion editor Chelsea Fairless have called it quits, only days after they were to have tied the knot.
And in keeping with DeLaria’s cutting sense of humor she revealed the split using their engagement photo – a photoshopped image from Liza Minnelli’s infamous 2002 nuptials to producer David Gest with Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor in attendance.
DeLaria, 58 photoshopped her and Fairless’ faces onto Minnelli and Gest. While the Roxette song “It Could Have Been Love” played, fans read about the breakup.

“Apparently this was an eerily prophetic choice of engagement photo as our relationship has since gone the way of David and Liza, with one small exception: our split is amicable,” DeLaria captioned the pic. “Please exclude us from the tragic and basic celebrity breakup narrative. We were happy together for four years and will remain in each other’s lives. In fact, we look forward to finding new ways to torture each other. We would like to thank our incredible friends and families for their love and support xoxo Lea & @female_trouble.”
DeLaria met Fairless who is believed to be in her early 30s through fellow OITNB star Emma Myles (Leanne). They had been planning their wedding to be on Sunday, January 8, the same day as DeLaria’s parents wedding anniversary. The star-studded affair was to have been officiated by Sandra Bernhard and “Modern Family” star Jesse Tyler Ferguson and hubby Justin Mikita were set to attend as well.

DeLaria, who came out during an appearance on the Arsenio Hall Show in 1993, told E! that she proposed to Fairless in 2005 after the SAG Awards.
“I was so filled with love. I turned to her at the Netflix party and asked her to marry me,” she said, “We announced it to all of our friends there.”

Chrissy Teigen revealed that she’s more comfortable posing completely naked than in a swimsuit.
“I’ve never been much of a beach girl,” the model said in an interview with ELLE Australia. “I grew up in Washington — it’s freezing in that ocean. So it’s out of my comfort zone, and it’s the craziest thing that I’m probably most known for Sports Illustrated when that’s how I feel the most uncomfortable.”

Finally, for the first time, I feel like I have a bit more of a womanly figure.”

Fourth Suspect Arrested In Philadelphia Dungeon Case, More Victims Revealed/n
By Radar Staff
Police in Philadelphia have arrested a fourth person on Wednesday in connection with the kidnapping of four mentally challenged adults who were found chained in a basement last weekend, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Jean McIntosh was taken into custody and charged with a string of offenses including kidnapping, conspiracy, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, and assault, the Philadelphia district attorney’s office confirmed according to a report on CNN.com.
The latest suspect is the 32-year-old daughter of the alleged ringleader, Linda Ann Weston, 51, who was arrested along with Eddie Wright, 49, and Thomas Gregory, 47, on Saturday after three men and a woman were found chained in a Tacony, Pennsylvania house.
PHOTOS: Inside The Philadelphia Dungeon Of Horrors
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, the torturous trio allegedly kidnapped their victims so that they could cash in their social security checks and then kept them like chained dogs in the makeshift dungeon in the house where McIntosh had an apartment.
The block captain for the neighborhood revealed his shock that McIntosh was involved in the hideous crimes. “I’m feeling sick to my stomach,” Danyell Tisdale told CNN after he heard that she was arrested.
“She was a nice neighbor and didn’t bother anybody. It’s shocking to me that she had anything to do with it. My sister’s children played with her two children.”
PHOTOS:  Celebs Who Have Done Jail Time
As the number of suspects in the bizarre case mounts, so does the number of victims – some of whom are also related to Weston.
The accused mastermind’s 19-year-old niece, Beatrice Weston, was locked in a closet upstairs while the police were busy downstairs in the boiler room sifting through the dank horror last weekend, Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey told the Philadelphia Inquirer how he had never seen such signs of abuse in a living person, as he descrbed the pellet guns wounds and spoon-shaped burns that covered Beatrice, who had been reported missing since she was 8 years old.
The tortured teenage girl is thought to have been used as a pawn in a feud between Weston and another daughter, Vicky.
PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots
Eight children in total have been taken into protective custody by police, a boy and girl ages 5 and 2, are believed to have been born to Tamara Breeden, one of the four mentally challenged people found locked in the Tacony basement while she was held against her will.
Police are conducting DNA testing to determine whether the children’s father is one of the other victims.
Police have not released the identifications of the victims but have confirmed other media reports are correct that name them as Derwin McLemire, Herbert Knowles, Edwin Sanabria and Breeden.
PHOTOS: Celebs Involved In Murder
Despite being mentally challenged, the victims spoke out earlier this week slamming their kidnappers. “That was real dirty of you. That was wrong,” said McLemire tearfully, who said he’d been held captive so long he didn’t even know what day it was.
“I got a birthday coming up Friday and I didn’t even know it was coming up. I’ll be 42 years old,” he told CBSPhilly.com. 
The victims, who were all beaten during their captivity, are now being cared for at a personal care center paid for by the state where they are receiving medical treatment and regular meals.
PHOTOS:  Sexy Stars Who Have Been Arrested
“I want to stay here for good,” said Breeden.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Weston, along with her boyfriend, Gregory, and Wright, a homeless man who neighbors said called himself a reverend, are thought to have fled north from Palm Beach, Florida, to escape the authorities there before being eventually captured. They did the long drive in a SUV with the four alleged victims held in the back.
Police are deciding whether the case will be handed over to the federal authorities because the crimes crossed.

Justin Bieber and Bella Hadid Twin in $1,198 Plaid Boxer-Like Shorts
/n

Justin Bieber seems to have a brand new source of fashion inspiration, and her name is Bella Hadid.
Earlier this week, 20-year-old Hadid made a major statement when she stepped out in N.Y.C. wearing a pair of bright red-and-green plaid boxer-style shorts, which are a collaboration between athletic brand Umbro and one of the model’s favorite designers, Virgil Abloh of Off-White. And like the true sartorial trend-setter that she is, she didn’t just wear them as she would a pair of sweats. Instead, she made an outfit out of the lounge shorts, pairing them with a cropped white sweater, black heeled sandals and two purses.
RELATED PHOTOS: Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and More Sizzling Celeb Swimwear Pics!
And the trend obviously stuck, because Bieber decided to get in on it as well. The following day, the singer sported the same exact shorts for a day out in N.Y.C, but went for a more athletic vibe, with a white t-shirt, white Yeezy sneakers and a red backpack.
Hadid recently spoke out about her love for the Off-White designer on the CFDA Awards red carpet, saying, “It’s the coolest clothes I’ve ever seen in my life but it’s just street style elevated. And thankfully Anna [Wintour] loves it and Anna loves him, that’s why were here. And I’m so happy for him. I mean I’ll wear his stuff till I die.”

So did Hadid let Bieber shop her closet, or are they both on that Off-White gifting list? Unclear — but you can get in on the trend, too, with a pair of matching pants, for a mere $1,198.

Natalie Portman Says Ashton Kutcher Was Paid Three Times More Than Her for ‘No Strings Attached’/n





                    Hollywood's Gender Pay Gap

The actress pens an essay about the struggle for equal pay.

Like many women before her, Natalie Portman was shafted in pay when she co-starred alongside Ashton Kutcher in 2011’s No Strings Attached. According to the actress, who won an Academy Award that same year, her castmate was paid three times more than her for the romantic comedy.

“Ashton Kutcher was paid three times as much as me on No Strings Attached. I knew and I went along with it because there’s this thing with ‘quotes’ in Hollywood,” Portman told Marie Claire U.K. “His [quote] was three times higher than mine so they said he should get three times more. I wasn’t as pissed as I should have been. I mean, we get paid a lot, so it’s hard to complain, but the disparity is crazy.”
“Compared to men, in most professions, women make 80 cents to the dollar,” she added. “In Hollywood, we are making 30 cents to the dollar.”

Having experienced instances of gender inequality herself, Portman said she was determined that her upcoming film, On the Basis of Sex, would be directed by a woman. Playing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first Jewish woman to be appointed to the United States Supreme Court, Portman thought there was no better way to advocate gender equality than by allowing female filmmakers to tell their story.
“I don’t think women and men are more or less capable [as directors], we just have a clear issue with women not having opportunities,” she said. “We need to be part of the solution, not perpetuating the problem. As this story is specifically about gender discrimination, I was like, ‘How dare we not hire a female.’”

Cleveland Browns: Police Threaten to Pull Protection Over Player's Dead Cop Post/nCleveland Browns player Isaiah Crowell's apology for a tasteless social media attack on cops is falling on deaf ears -- and in fact, police tell TMZ Sports ... they'll pull out of the Browns' stadium in protest. Crowell got blasted for posting an illustration last week of a cop getting his throat slashed by a masked person. He posted it on Wednesday -- after Alton Sterling and Philando Castile's deaths, but the day before 5 Dallas officers were shot and killed. The running back deleted the post and the Browns demanded he publicly apologize, which he did.But Stephen Loomis, President of Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, thinks the  "store-bought apology " isn't enough.  "He needs to go to Dallas, help the families who lost their loved ones last week, write them a check, look them in the eyes and give a heartfelt apology. " Loomis says Crowell's post was as  "offensive as putting a picture of historical African-American men being hung from a tree in the 60s. " He adds that if Crowell doesn't go to Dallas and make a donation,  "I will pull Cleveland officers, sheriffs, state troopers out of First Energy Stadium this season if he doesn't make it right. " As for Crowell admitting he was wrong and acted out of rage -- Loomis says,  "You're a grown ass man, and you claim you were too emotional to know it was wrong? Think we'll accept your apology? Kiss my ass. "  Crowell did meet with Cleveland's police chief, but Loomis isn't satisfied. He's demanding the Browns and /or the NFL drop the hammer./n
Lily Collins Reveals How Her Famous Parents Influence Her Dating Life: 'I'm Really Attracted to Mysterious Creatives'
/n

 
Lily Collins has a very specific type when it comes to dating — all thanks to her mom and dad.
The 28-year-old actress, who is the daughter of legendary musician Phil Collins and American socialite Jill Tavelman, opened up about how her famous parents’ relationship has influenced her own love life.
“I find that I’m really attracted to mysterious creatives, and I love people that are able to put their emotions out there for not just the world to see, but just that are giving of their emotions, but a little bit mysterious and elusive as well,” she said on The Talk.
Collins said it was her mom who taught her a key life lesson: that she had to love herself while also allowing others to love her as well. 
“My mom is such a strong, independent, strong-willed woman and she always taught me to accept my worth for how I viewed myself and female empowerment, and it’s okay to be independent and also need someone at the same time,” she said. “I kinda get to be both.”
The actress previously dated British actor Jamie Campbell Bower for over a year in 2013 and was romantically linked to Nick Jonas in 2016.
RELATED VIDEO: Lily Collins Writes an Open Letter to Dad Phil Collins: ‘I Forgive the Mistakes You Made’

Collins has been open about her tumultuous relationship with her father, who divorced her mother when the actress was just 5 years old.
In her new memoir, Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me, Collins explains how she reconnected with her father after years of estrangement — and why she decided to forgive him.
“Because my dad was often gone, I never wanted to do anything that would make him stay away even longer,” she writes. “I became extra careful about what I said and how I said it, afraid he’d think I was angry or didn’t love him. And the truth is, I was angry. I missed him and wanted him there.”
She then addresses her dad directly, writing, “I forgive you for not always being there when I needed and for not being the dad I expected. I forgive the mistakes you made.”

 Holiday Decorator Slams Kim & Kroy After Sad Courtroom Battle: ‘This Is Ridiculous!’.../n
Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann are still allegedly refusing to pay for their Christmas decorations, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal!
The Don’t Be Tardy stars “appeared at the justice Center of Atlanta on Aug. 23, 2017 for their scheduled mediation” with Seasonal Designs LLC, but “they were unable to resolve their dispute,” according to Fulton County court documents obtained by Radar.
Now, Zolciak, 39, and Biermann, 31, will have to appear in court again over their alleged $6,000 bill.
PHOTOS: Real Plastic, Real Housewife! Kim Zolciak’s Head-To-Toe Makeover REVEALED –– Nose Job, Chin Implant, Boobs & More
“We’re waiting on a court date,” the company’s owner Jeanne told Radar. “I have absolutely no idea [when it will be]. I don’t know how they come up with a court date.”
“This is ridiculous,” she said. “I’m gonna keep going and see what happens. Somewhere down the line something is gonna come out of it. Once we go to court we’ll see what happens.”
READ THE COURT DOCS!
Jeanne first sued the reality stars in March 2017 after they allegedly failed to pay for their Christmas decorations in December 2016. The couple refused to acknowledge her suit until Biermann was served shortly after Kash’s traumatic dog attack.
They fired back with their own legal docs, claiming that they want to “dispute the total amount charged” — but they failed to say what their bill should have totaled.

Zolciak was previously sued by a party planner after Brielle’s 11th birthday party and both she and Biermann were sued by their former housekeeper for unpaid wages. Biermann was sued separately for allegedly failing to pay a babysitter for their brood.

Hollywood Trainer Jeanette Jenkins on How She's Helping Pink Strengthen Her Core After Baby No. 2
/n
Pink was back at the gym six weeks after giving birth to son Jameson last December, and has been regularly meeting with Hollywood Trainer Jeanette Jenkins to help get her post-baby body back.
“Week one was about getting the body moving through all of the planes of motion and reconnecting the core back to movement,” Jenkins — who will serve as the Global Powerwalk Ambassador for almost 20 Dress for Success 5k Power Walks taking place around the world this summer — tells PEOPLE.
“The pelvis wall and transverse abdominus and all the muscles of the core have been working very hard from carrying and from labor, and it takes time and specific exercises to bring them back to function at their best.”
Jenkins and her team have been training with Pink four to five times a week to get her back in shape.
“Every session is different because it depends on what is going on in her body,” she says. “We mix up the methods of training — sculpting, rowing, boxing, dance, yoga, Pilates, power walking, jogging, running and cycling — for variety on the body, but there are some base moves that are done weekly to make sure we are specifically strengthening the pelvis wall, transverse abdominus and all the muscles of the core.”
Pink and Jenkins are also gearing up to cycle 100 miles next month to raise money for No Kid Hungry.
“This was Pink’s idea, and it’s amazing when you can combine your training with a cause so you can put even more purpose behind your exercise,” says Jenkins. “That’s another great reason why I love the Dress for Success Power Walk — it gives an additional purpose to training.”

Pink has been posting her progress on Instagram — the singer hopes to drop a total of 35 lbs. of pregnancy weight — and Jenkins says she has no worry that her star client will be able to reach her goals.
“Pink loves to move her body and she is a natural athlete,” she says. “Her attitude is stellar! I wish everyone had her attitude towards movement. She’s an absolute joy and an inspiration to millions.”
As much as she is committed to losing the weight, Pink has posted about not being concerned with the number on the scale and focuses more on how she feels and having fun during her workouts.
“Pink has always been a very powerful woman and her attitude towards her post-baby body fits in line with her values,” says Jenkins. “We laugh at least 50 percent of every session — it’s so important to your health to love yourself and feel joy and let it resonate through your body and touch every cell.”

Pastor Joel Osteen Scrambles To Defend Megachurch Closure Amid The Catastrophe Caused By Hurricane Harvey/n

Joel Osteen is in damage control mode.
As we previously reported, the famed Texas pastor has been facing backlash on social media following claims that he's kept his massive Lakewood Church closed to the flood victims caused by Hurricane Harvey. Uh oh.
Related: Elisabeth Moss Defends Scientology!
Osteen was first hit with criticism over the weekend when the Lakewood Church's Facebook account announced that the house of pray was "inaccessible due to severe flooding." This post had tongues waggin' as photos surfaced proving the Church was unaffected during the start of the hurricane.
In an attempt to clean up this controversy, Joel released another statement where he defended that Lakewood had NOT closed its doors to those in need, but is simply waiting for the "shelters [to] reach capacity" before welcoming evacuees.
The religious leader added:
"We have never closed our doors. We will continue to be a distribution center for those in need. Lakewood will be a value to the community in the aftermath of this storm in helping our fellow citizens to rebuild our lives."
One Lakewood worshipper weighed in on the controversy as she shared on Twitter:

Seriously quite sickening when people spread negative news without knowing the situation. This is the situation of our church @lakewoodch pic.twitter.com/0KKBmu6hW8
— Lynne Gabriel (@heyitslynneg) August 28, 2017
However, thanks to footage (below) from a local resident, it's been proven that there is still no flooding outside of the church.

As you surely know, Hurricane Harvey was a Category 4 when it first touched down on Friday. The storm has taken at least 10 lives and has left numerous homes flooded. Not to mention, several Texas towns are bracing themselves for the next phase of the catastrophic storm.
The state of Louisiana has already begun evacuating residents. Oh man.
Our thoughts are with everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey.

News, The Arrangement star Christine Evangelista is dropping hints about what's ahead for her character in season two following Sunday night's jaw-dropping finale.After being betrayed by fiancé Kyle West (Josh Henderson), kidnapped and forced to undergo therapy at the Institute for the Higher Mind's transformation facility, Megan returned to her "normal" life seemingly reformed, but secretly ready to get the ultimate revenge. But what will that look like exactly?"I'm very excited to see Megan kind of take control and come into her own," Christine tells us. "She's dealt with the forgiveness, the burden that she's carried all along and the pain that she's carried all along. Now that she's able to sort of move on from it in some way and acknowledge what happened and just be honest about it to everyone around her, I think there's a lot of strength to be gained from that."

She continues, "I think Megan is in a very powerful position right now. She has a tremendous amount of strength, so I'm very excited to use that power in season two."That could definitely mean trouble for her relationship with Kyle, especially after he allowed Terence Anderson (Michael Vartan) to lock her up for treatment. But despite his act of disloyalty, Christine doesn't believe it's the end of Megan and Kyle's love story."She is pissed," Christine says. "She's been burned and she's scared and I think she's in the position now where she could either take Kyle along with her or take them all down. I know that she genuinely loves Kyle and she cares for him and there's part of me that really wants her to take him with her, get out and remove themselves from the situation, from the Institute and from Terence."

However, creator Jonathan Abrahams will ultimately be the one who decides how the story will play out going forward."Jonathan and I did have some conversations about it early on as to where we wanted it to go and what Megan is going to be like next season and how she's going to take everything's she's learned and apply it," Christine explains. "We just started the writers' room a couple weeks ago, but your guess is as good as mine. I just know it's going to be pretty explosive."

And that's all we need to know!

Inside Glen Campbell's Devastating Final Days/n
Glen Campbell died on Aug. 8, but his iconic velvety voice was silenced years before as he bravely struggled with the debilitating effects of Alzheimer’s disease.
Nearly two years before his death, Glen’s fourth wife of 35 years, Kim, removed the “Rhinestone Cowboy” singer from a care center and brought him to live out his sad last days at their home in Nashville.
Glen, she once noted, would sometimes lash out in fear after his condition had reached its seventh and final stage.
“He punched me in the eye] and I had a black eye for two weeks,” Kim once noted. “It’s really hard to cope with. I know that’s not him — it’s just the Alzheimer’s.”
The singer, also “lost most of his ability to communicate verbally” or play the guitar, a talent that had rocketed him to fame and 21 number one hits on the Top 40.

“I don’t even know if he knows what it’s for,” Kim, 58, said. “He’s in his own world right now.”
However, she reassured at the time, Glen “still understands the universal language of smiles and kisses, and he enjoys that.”
However, reported Globe last year, his daughter revealed her dad “doesn’t really recognize me anymore.”
“He recognizes me as someone that he loves, but he doesn’t really know who I am,” Ashley Campbell said.
As RadarOnline.com reported, Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2011. By 2015, the iconic star was in the final throes of the debilitating and deadly disease.
He died in Nashville on Aug. 8 at the age of 81.

Kobe Bryant: Gets Offer From Dad's Italian Team ... In Majestic Letter/nIt might be the most passionate, poetic job offer ever -- the letter an Italian basketball team sent to Kobe Bryant ... begging him to play for them after he leaves the NBA ... and it's friggin' beautiful.  The team behind the offer is Viola Reggio Calabria -- the team where Kobe's dad, Joe  "Jellybean " Bryant﻿, dominated back in 1986-87 ... once scoring 69 points in one game.  The team got word that Kobe has been kicking around the idea of playing overseas -- and reached out through an open letter to the Mamba ... which included a picture of him wearing a Viola shirt back when he was 8 years old.     "The picture shows an eight-year old boy, proud to wear the jersey with the words Viola Reggio Calabria. Unbeknownst back then, he was destined to great things. That eight-year-old boy was you, Kobe. "  There's more ...   "Dear child of Reggio Calabria, fantastic Kobe, on this most beautiful stretch of land that is full of affection for you we close our eyes and dream. "  "There will always be a home for you at this great club on the Straits of Messina. Our dream might be too big but maybe it is the same dream you unknowingly had as that 8-year-old boy in the picture. "  "We want you to come home, to wear our colours, to represent our city, just as your father did before you. There is a black and orange family waiting for you, with the same name on the back: 'Bryant.' "  "A warm hug, dear Kobe, our great basketball legend. " So far, no word on if Kobe's actually considering the offer. /n
Source Says Tamar Braxton Has Been Living In 'Private Hell' With Husband Vince Herbert — The Shocking Allegations Of Ongoing Domestic Violence HERE/n

Everything isn't always as it seems.
As Tamar Braxton continues to defend her marriage to Vince Herbert, a source has come forward with shocking claims that the 39-year-old is living in a "personal hell" as yet another alleged altercation comes to light.
You may recall back in August, police responded to the couple's Ritz-Carlton room in Atlanta after an alleged incident that cause Vince to flee the scene before cops arrived.
Now we're hearing these fights aren't so rare — and, it sounds like Tamar's sisters have had about enough.
The insider tells DailyMail.com: 
"But her family fears that 13 [years of marriage] may be their sister's unlucky number and that if things don't change with Tamar and Vince, she could end up like Rihanna after the Chris Brown altercation or worse."
Related: Tamar Wants To Take Her Act To Broadway!
We're also hearing there was another situation several months ago where sister Toni Braxton called police after a fight between the couple in Calabasas, CA — but nothing was done as there was no clear evidence:
"Again, since there were no physical signs of battery, Vince was not arrested. But these fights are happening more and more."
Further, the outlet reports Braxton has been living in a "private hell" after suffering financial and marital problems in the wake of her firing from The Real.
Yikes, we're really hoping this isn't true!
Regardless, T.B. continues to present her union with Vince as a perfect marriage:

deceiving. Incredible intuitive, knife-sharp, and might I say, sexy at her post. I trust her with my life." Pitt's full interview, and more photographs by Inez and Vinoodh, can be seen in V Magazine's Winter 2015 issue, on sta.../n
Brad Pitt is the epitome of a handsome leading man.He makes movies and travels the world with his beautiful wife Angelina Jolie and their equally beautiful six children. But as 51-year-old Pitt tells V Magazine's winter issue, his main role in life is surprisingly normal: He's just a dad.As he tells V Magazine of his life with 40-year-old Jolie, "At the end of the day, we get to be parents, greeting our lovely, crazy children and talking about their day, making sure they brush their teeth."

The Jolie-Pitts have a full house—in addition to mom and dad, there's Maddox, 14, Pax, 11, Zahara, 10, Shiloh, 9 and twins Knox and Vivienne, 7. Pitt and Jolie probably don't get a ton of alone time at home thanks to all the kids, but that gives them all the more reason to work together.In the upcoming drama By the Sea, Jolie is Pitt's co-star and his boss. There might have been an added pressure working on the film with his wife as its director, but Pitt wasn't all that worried. As he explained to V Magazine, "Naturally I didn't want to fail Angie's ideas...her words...but I really had absolute faith we'd figure it out."Pitt and Jolie, who fell in love while shooting the 2005 movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith, were eager to work together again. "If I'm going to work, I want to work with my wife," said Pitt.

Turns out, they're a pretty good match personally and professionally. Pitt gushed that it was "surprising how much I enjoy the direction of my wife," adding, "She's deceiving. Incredible intuitive, knife-sharp, and might I say, sexy at her post. I trust her with my life."Pitt's full interview, and more photographs by Inez and Vinoodh, can be seen in V Magazine's Winter 2015 issue, on stands Nov. 12.Watch the video below for a first look at the making of By the Sea, which hits theaters Nov. 13.

Can they sway your vote?

 MORE >>





Regardless of which side you stand on the aisle, everyone can pretty much agree that the 2016 presidential race has been completely and utterly ridiculous. After what felt like a lifetime of name-calling, leaked emails, and sexual harassment accusations, Election Day has finally arrived and we can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing we’ve finally made it to the voting booth unscathed from this so-called electoral trainwreck

To commemorate the momentous occasion, we’ve rounded up the most ridiculously awesome things you can get to let the world know that you have survived this messy, messy campaign.





1. Trapvilla #HillaryGrayBrim Tee, $35. As seen on Clintonistas like Rihanna and Lena Dunham, this shirt is the perfect way to show that you’re still #WithHer even long after the elections are over.
2. “Make Donald Drumpf Again” Baseball Hat, $15. Earlier this year, Last Week Tonight host John Oliver did a piece on Donald Trump, discovering that the Republican presidential candidate’s ancestors had changed their surname from “Drumpf” to “Trump” to make themselves sound more prestigious. As a response HBO started selling these hats that mock Trump’s campaign motto.
3. Fishs Eddy Hillary Clinton Mug, $13.95. Are you with Hillary Clinton? Start your day off by sipping your coffee — or the tears of Trump supporters — from this statement-making cup.
4. Kanarek “Nasty Woman” Necklace, $350 $175. Ever since Trump infamously labeled his opponent a “nasty woman” during their final presidential debate, many Clinton supporters have adopted the term to call themselves. Anne Hathaway was seen wearing this same sterling silver necklace when she was campaigning for Clinton at a local college. As if reclaiming what Trump’s insult wasn’t sticking it to him enough already, $25 of each sale will be donated to Planned Parenthood.
5. Jonathan Adler Election Socks, $30. Diehard Democrats can now show off their pride with these funky socks. Republicans, they make socks with your colors, too.

Adele is using her fame and fortune to help others.On Thursday evening, the big-voiced singer hosted a private movie screening of Despicable Me 3 for children affected by the Grenfell Tower fire in an attempt to lift up their spirits after the devastating blaze that killed around 80 people in June. The "Rolling in the Deep" singer treated the young victims to the private showing of the animated film at London's Whiteley's cinema on Thursday evening,A source who attended the event said that Adele's presence was quite the surprise. "It was very intimate. All we knew as we boarded the fancy coach that there was a special screening just for us. We didn't even know there was a special guest," said the attendee. 

The source added that the invite came through The ClementJames Centre, an educational charity that has been helping the survivors of Grenfell. The charity, which became a central hub for donations, supplies and help for victims, hosts a free summer camp for local kids and this special outing was part of it.The insider added that no one knew Adele was going to be there and said, "Adele was lovely and she sat with a few of the kids in the row in front of us, chatting away....Adele made time for everyone and mingled with the kids."

And that wasn't all the children who were affected by the fire got treated too. "Snacks were provided: popcorn in the foyer and Smarties [chocolates] and water in each seat arm," said the movie goer.The mother of one of the young kids, a boy named Boulevard, Instagramed a photo of the Grammy winner and her son from the screening. Adele appeared to be makeup free, wearing a casual ensemble for the evening outing.In addition to a big voice, she's got a big heart!

Lowry, 25, welcomed her third child with her baby daddy on Saturday, August 5th. She is also mother to Isaac, 7, with ex-boyfriend Jo Rivera and Lincoln, 3, with ex-husband Javi Marroquin.
Although the MTV star is single, she insisted she isn’t looking to date any time soon!

“There is no dating for me right now,” Lowry told Radar. “I think that’s out of the question.”
Lowry and Lopez split around the time she learned she was expecting. Although he has been involved in their son’s life, who they have yet to name, she insisted they aren’t back together.
“I’m not really thinking about that,” she said of Lopez. “I just want to focus on the new baby and getting the other boys adjusted to having the baby in the house.”
But Lowry isn’t ruling out dating forever, as she told Radar on possibly getting married again one day, “Probably, I don’t know. Things are always changing. It’s a possibility!”
Although Lowry and Lopez aren’t rekindling their romance, they have been co-parenting well.

She added, “Every child deserves their dad. I’m hopeful. I’m positive he’ll be around.”

'Dewey' Author Adopts New Kitten Named Page/n
Another orange feline has found a place in the heart of best-selling author, Vicki Myron. Myron’s cat, Dewey Readmore Books, who was the subject of her popular book Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World and came to her via the book drop at the Spencer, Iowa library where she worked for 20 years, passed away in November of 2006.  Her new kitten was found in the street on a very cold day last month, according to USA Today. “It was snowing quite heavily and she was covered in snow. She had ice chunks hanging from her. She had twigs and leaves tangled in her fur,” says Mryon’s friend, Sue Selzer, who rescued the kitty. “I took her back to my office and dried her off, put some warm water on her and cleaned her up.”
When Selzer offered up the kitten to Myron, she “fell in love instantly.” In the spirit of all things book-based, Myron has named the cat Page. “She’s a sweet, loving cat, very affectionate, very easy going,” she says of Page, who looks very similar to Dewey. “She’s definitely a girl but eats like a pig, probably because she was a street cat that probably had to fend for herself.”
Myron, who retired as library director last year, had intended to wait a year or two before bringing a new feline into her home because she’s been on the road frequently promoting her book. But she says the timing was just right with Page’s arrival. “I knew if the right one came along at the right time I’d get one, but I was hoping it would be a couple of years down the road because I’m not around much,” she says. “But here she is. We kind of found each other.”
Myron’s new kitty won’t be Dewey’s successor at the Spencer library though, the newspaper says. Kay Larson, the library’s current director, says the board will discuss getting a new cat at its Jan. 8 meeting.

U.S. Senate Pulls a Kanye West On Media, Don't Talk to Us in the Capitol/n3:33 PM PT -- The Senate Rules Committee just reversed the restriction ... so all is good with hallway interviews. U.S. Senators just collectively stiff-armed the media -- banning all recorded interviews in the hallways of the Capitol ... unless reporters get special permission. The new rule essentially allows the Senate to cherry-pick who they talk to and where. It also means our guy in D.C. won't be getting candid moments with YOUR elected officials. No more Sen. Burr boasting about his committee's TV ratings ... or Sen. Graham advising President Trump on his golf game ... or Sen. McCain pouring his heart out to Ashton Kutcher. Hallway interviews will still be allowed if approved by the Senate Rules Committee, the Senate Sergeant At Arms or the Senate Radio and TV Committee. Translation: more red tape and more booooring. Kanye probably put it best .../n
RHOBH Fans Left Divided Over Kim Richards' Ice Cold Decision To Return The Stuffed Animal Lisa Rinna Gave Her!/n

Ice cold!
It's safe to say that shit got Real during the second installment of the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills reunion.
While many people thought the most dramatic moment would be Erika Girardi's face off against Dorit and PK Kemsley, it was RHOBH vet Kim Richards who stole the reunion spotlight!
Related: Kim Once Dated Donald Trump!
How?? Well, as Bravo previously teased on YouTube, Paris Hilton's aunt returned the bunny arch nemesis Lisa Rinna gave her as a peace offering gift for her new grandson. Ouch!
Be sure to watch the savage moment go down for yourself (below)! 

However, what the clip doesn't show is that Miz Richards doesn't back down from her decision even AFTER Harry Hamlin's wife breaks down in tears and runs off the set. As Eileen Davidson chased after a weepy Rinna, the Bravolebrity shouted from the couch:
"It's good that you feel bad for a minute because you hurt me!"
DAMNNNNN, Kim!
Thankfully, Eileen was there to comfort Lisa R. as she encouraged the Veronica Mars alum to ignore Kim as she was just trying to "demean" her and "hurt" her. Also, we can imagine Richards is making a play to get back on RHOBH. We mean, all of the inneresting plot lines have to do with her and she's NOT EVEN ON THE SHOW ANYMORE!
And it seems we're not the only ones to have an opinion about this Kim vs. Lisa face off as many fans have since flocked to Twitter to weigh in on the situation (below).

I like Lisa Rinna but why would you cry over Kim Richards returning the bunny? You're not even friends. #RHOBHReunion

Prince Harry Shows Some Love for Harry Styles/nIt's almost too much Harry for a photo. Britain's 2 favorite Harry's -- Prince Harry and Harry Styles -- came face-to-face Thursday night in London. It happened at the at the  "Dunkirk " premiere at the Odeon in Leicester Square. It's the 1D guy's debut role in a movie, and it happens to be about the WWII battle at Dunkirk -- which explains why the royal one was all ribboned up. It's not the first time they've met -- as many assumed. They hooked up in 2015 at a Royal concert event in London. Y'know the red headed Harry's jammed out to  "Story of My Life " more than a few times, right?/n
Kate Beckinsale's 'Overzealous Fan' Allegedly Followed Her Cross-Country, Threatened to Stab Her (UPDATE)/n11:52 AM PT -- A Florida judge on Sunday called for Repp's misdemeanor stalking charge to be upgraded to a felony charge, saying his alleged offense qualifies as aggravated stalking. The charge was not officially upgraded Sunday, but Repp could be facing a felony charge soon enough. He's being held on a $5,000 bond.Kate Beckinsale has been dealing with a man who allegedly followed her across the country over the past year, and even threatened to stab her once prior to being busted at Tampa Bay Comic Con. Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... 45-year-old Terry Lee Repp was arrested Saturday morning at the Tampa Convention Center after cops were told to be on the lookout for him, due to his history with Kate.  We're told one officer recognized Repp before Kate appeared for her 11 AM Q&A panel, and arrested him on the spot. He was booked at Hillsborough County Jail for stalking. According to the police report, obtained by TMZ, Repp has been following and harassing Kate for at least a year. He allegedly made physical contact with her at an event in Salt Lake City in 2016 -- touching her back and then threatening to stab her. He also ran into her again at another event in Houston the same year, where he was detained by cops and booted as well.  Cops say Repp appears to  "have an irrational obsession with the victim and has traveled across the country in an effort to harass her. " We're told Repp did not make contact with Kate this time, but she did have to come to the police station to file a police report. As we reported ... she went on to do her panel later the same day./n

Hollywood sure loves a remake.And it seems like every couple of months we're hit with another rumor that producers are looking to remake Thelma & Louise.That doesn't sit well with Geena Davis, who starred alongside Susan Sarandon in the 1991 film."Leave it the hell alone," Davis told me earlier today on her way to the San Diego Film Festival, where she was set to receive this year's Reframed Humanitarian Award. "I mean, come on! People can do whatever they want but it doesn't seem like it needs to be remade."People are still watching it the same amount as they ever did," the Oscar winner said. "It's hard to meet someone who hasn't seen the movie. I think it holds up."

For the record, Sarandon is also against a remake. "I'm not in favor of a remake, and I'm not sure what the idea behind it would be," the Dean Man Walking star told Vulture in 2012 after Lindsay Lohan tweeted she wanted to star in a remake with Jennifer Lawrence. "It's a great story that could maybe be redone in a different context, with perhaps two guys. But re-creating it similarly to the way it was already done doesn't make sense to me."Davis, however, is excited that a Beetlejuice sequel is finally going to be made—even if she doesn't think she'll be back. In the 1988 film, she and Alec Baldwin play married ghosts who ask a "bio-exorcist" to rid the house they haunt of the family that's just moved in."They haven't talked to me about it, but I'm assuming ghosts don't age so what would they do?" Davis said, laughing. "It's been almost 30 years!"That's not all the Geena we have for you. Come back tomorrow to find out what she said about the very simple thing Hollywood could do to finally end its gender inequality problem.And check out the video below to hear what Sarandon told E! News about working with then-newcomer Brad Pitt in Thelma & Louise.

Nathan Lane Is Officially Off The Market After Marrying His Partner Of 18 Years! Squee!/n

Congratulations!
On Thursday, it was confirmed that Nathan Lane wed his partner of 18 years earlier this week. LOVES it!
It's said that the Tony Award winner and Devlin Elliott tied the knot in a ceremony at City Hall in NYC. Color us jealous!
Related: Miranda Lambert Isn't Crying About Gwen & Blake! 
The Birdcage actor's rep noted:

"Nathan and Devlin were married in a small ceremony in New York City this week. Everyone is extremely happy."
That's AH-Mazing! Though we are curious to learn if any A-Listers turned up to the private ceremony?? HA!
In case you forgot, the funnyman and his producer-love recently worked together to create a children's book called Naughty Mabel — which just happens to be based on their adorable French Bulldog. Talk about #RelationshipGoals!
In a previous interview, Delvin shared:

"She's become our version of a child .. really all she wants is for you to pick her up and hold her like a baby."
Awww! However, Nathan later quipped:

"She's a little neurotic and needy at times. It's like living with a supermodel. And now that she's become a celebrity, you know, it's very difficult."
HIGHlarious! We can't be the only ones that want to attend a dinner party at their home, right?!
Congrats again you two. Let us know if you EVER need a dog sitter. LOLz!

kind of has a certain amount of respect and power and I think she's quite content where she is. Ish. She'll never be content; it's Game of Thrones," Sophie Turner told E! News. About that "ish," viewers saw the .../n
Let's hear it for the women of Game of Thrones. As season seven is about to hit airwaves, the ladies of Westeros are looking back—and ahead—at their journey's on the show."I do think the show has given rise to more of a platform whereby women—the whole notion of womanhood—is being explored," Gwendoline Christie told E! News' Kristin Dos Santos at the premiere of Game of Thrones season seven. "I've always really deeply admired the show ever since it first started because, for me, it's been one of the first mainstream shows to really push women and female characters to the forefront and make those characters incredibly complex and interesting. That's important to me, it's very important to me in my work to be political in a positive way."

While Brienne of Tarth is kicking butt and taking names, Sansa Stark has another battle brewing."Well, I'm rooting for her. I'm not rooting for her to be on the Throne. I think her lust for power is long gone. I think she's happy to be home in Winterfell. She's happy to be with Jon and she kind of has a certain amount of respect and power and I think she's quite content where she is. Ish. She'll never be content; it's Game of Thrones," Sophie Turner told E! News.About that "ish," viewers saw the looks between Sansa Stark, Littlefinger (Aiden Gillen) as Jon Snow (Kit Harington) was crowned King in the North.

"I think, initially he kind of gave her that first kill and the respect she felt she deserved. It almost seemed like that patriarchy and the sexism between them was finally leveling out and finally they were equals. But in that very last scene when he was hailed King in the North and she wasn't hailed as anything and he didn't say anything, I think she felt a little disheartened and there's definitely a little bit of tension still there."Where does that tension go? You'll have to tune in on Sunday, July 16 when the show debuts on HBO. Click play on the video above for more from the Game of Thrones cast.

The Amber Rose Show (VH1)* – June 17, Fridays 11 p.m.
Orange Is the New Black (Netflix) – June 17
“This season seems to be on the darker side, from what I can tell from the trailer. I loved last season and how we got to know more of the supporting characters better, and I am looking forward to seeing how they will be included in this season’s storyline in which the prison increases its capacity, there’s tons of tears and eventually a squad of officers wearing riot gear.” – Kaitlyn





Mother, May I Sleep with Danger (Lifetime Movie) – June 18, 8 p.m.
James Franco’s long-awaited reboot of the 1996 cult TV movie premieres on Lifetime at 8 p.m. on Saturday, June 18. Franco’s reboot is a spin on the classic, with a lesbian vampire narrative (*amazing*).

Real Housewives of Orange County (Bravo) – June 20, Mondays 9 p.m.
Pretty Little Liars (Freeform) – June 21, Tuesdays 8 p.m.
“After every PLL season finale, I declare I’m done with the show. And yet every summer and fall, I’m in front of the TV every Tuesday at 8 pm. It hasn’t officially been announced, but most PLL fans are under the impression that season 7 is going to be its final, and as devastating as that might be, it means we may finally get some answers! I was never really satisfied with Charles/Cece reveal, and I’m hoping that Marlene King comes through for me one last time.” – Jelani
Greenleaf (OWN) – June 21, 10 p.m. (airing Wednesdays, 10 p.m.)
Oprah’s new drama Greenleaf is having its two-night premiere on Tuesday, June 21 (10/9 c) and Wednesday, June 22 (9/8 c).

Real Housewives of New Jersey (Bravo) – July 10, Sundays 8 p.m.
The Night Of (HBO) – July 10, Sundays 9 p.m.
“I love a good murder mystery and I love a well done HBO series, so The Night Of really checks all the boxes for a show that I’ll tune into. Based on Criminal Justice, a British drama starring Ben Whishaw on Season 1 and then Maxine Peake on Season 2, the miniseries centers around a man who is accused of murdering a girl on the Upper West Side. As not a lot has been shown in its trailer, the whole ‘whodunnit’ mystery is just THAT much more intriguing.” – Gabi





Difficult People (Hulu) – July 12
“I am just digging in to season one and I am already in love. Billy Eichner’s wit that is displayed on ‘Billy on the Street’ is not lost in his new Hulu comedy series that also stars Julie Klausner. Though the plot about ‘two struggling and jaded New York comedians’ sounds tired on paper, the writing is sharp and exceptionally self-aware. Be prepared to revisit society through the twisted vista of Billy Eichner.” – Mia





Suits (USA) – July 13, Wednesday 9 p.m.
Mr. Robot (USA) – July 13, Wednesday 10 p.m.
“I cannot wait for the return of Mr. Robot. The first season completely blew me away; especially Rami Malek and Christian Slater’s performances. We received two big reveals late in season one of the show— Slater’s character was dead and was Elliot’s [Malik] father, and Carly Chaikin’s character Darlene was revealed to be Elliot’s sister. I can only image what season two is going to bring us. Bring on the disruption of Evil Corp! The second season of Mr. Robot premieres July 13 on USA.” – Michael
Stranger Things (Netflix)* – July 15
Starring Winona Ryder, Stranger Things is set in 1980s Indiana, where a young boy vanishes into thin air.





Ballers (HBO) – July 17, Sundays 10 p.m.
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is back for season 2 of the HBO drama about the lives of former and current football players and their handlers.
Vice Principals (HBO)* – July 17, Sundays 10:30 p.m.





Shooter (USA)* – July 19, Tuesdays 10 p.m.
Shooter stars the irresistible Ryan Phillippe, so, there’s that.





Looking: The Movie (HBO Movie) – July 23, Saturday 10 p.m.
Following the short-lived show’s cancellation, Looking: The Movie serves to tie-up loose ends for the group of gay men (including Jonathan Groff, Frankie J. Alvarez and Murray Bartlett) in San Francisco.
BoJack Horseman (Netflix) – July 22
“I happened into first season of Bojack Horseman in a phase of boredom two summers ago, and I took a slow, skeptical liking to the show. By the end of the first season, I was invested, if not necessarily in love. Things got really good in the second season, when Bojack found the right balance of odd humor and thoughtful, empathetic commentary on depression and self-destruction. I hope season three will keep that balance and continue building upon the groundwork laid out during its first two years.” – Matt





August
Bachelor in Paradise (ABC) – August 2, Tuesdays 8 p.m.
“This is a show that I shamelessly watch in the privacy of my room where no one can judge me for entertaining in the sludge that is ‘Bachelor Nation.’ It’s terrible — all of it, from start to finish, but I can’t get enough of the soap opera banter that may or may not be scripted. If you need a show that makes you feel better about your Tinder exchanges, this is the program for you.”– Mia
The Get Down (Netflix)* – August 12
This new musical drama is set in the Bronx in the 1970’s and follows a bunch of ragtag tag teens.





Fear the Walking Dead (AMC) – August 21, Sundays 9 p.m.
Gomorrah (Sundance) – August 24, Wednesdays 10 p.m.
Sundance has acquired the Italian television crime drama series and will begin airing the first season this summer. It’s based on the best-selling non-fiction book by journalist Roberto Saviano, which inspired the film Gomorrah (which won the 2008 Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival).
Shut Eye (Hulu)* – August 31
September
Master’s of Sex (Showtime) – September 11, Sundays 10 p.m.
South Park (Comedy Central) – September 14, Wednesdays TBD
Marvel’s Luke Cage (Netflix)* – September 30
“As Marvel expands its partnership with Netflix, it’s going to be interesting to see how they keep things fresh and interesting. This character was a lot of fun in Jessica Jones. I can’t wait to see how they craft his origin story.” – Scott





October
Shameless (Showtime) – October 2, Sundays 9 p.m.
November
The Crown (Netflix) – November 4
The Crown is a biographical drama about the U.K.’s royal family. It will trace the life of Queen Elizabeth II from her wedding in 1947 to the present day, and is expected to span 60 episodes over six seasons with Claire Foy as the lead.





The Affair (Showtime) – November 20, 10 p.m.
Fall TV Shows: Premiere Dates TBA
Streaming
Transparent (Amazon)
Word on the street is Caitlyn Jenner will be joining Season 3 of Transparent. (It was inevitable, to be honest). There’s no release date for the Amazon show, so stay tuned.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Netflix)
“As a longtime fan of Gilmore Girls — not to date myself, but I watched the original run live on The WB/CW — the news that Amy Sherman-Palladino has at last been given the chance to fulfill her ultimate vision for the show she created and oversaw for six years fills me with deep anticipation and joy. I have no idea what’s in store for Lorelai and Rory Gilmore almost a decade after they went off the air, but whatever’s coming, I’m “all in,” as Luke Danes would say.” – Matt

 The X Factor Addresses Lip Syncing Scandal After Contestant Leroy Bell Caught Faking It.../n
By Radar Staff
A singing slip-up on Thursday’s episode of The X Factor caused outcry as millions of viewers heard contestant Leroy Bell singing before his microphone was even up to his mouth.
The blunder occurred while the finalists were performing a group number together, but still spawned speculation that the other performances could be faked, which Fox quickly addressed.
“All survival songs are performed live, with just a backing track,” an X Factor representative said in a statement to TheWrap.com.
PHOTOS:  American Idol Winners
“For the group ensemble performance, the vocals are pre-recorded to allow acts to concentrate on preparing for their own live competitive performances on Wednesdays  – this is also no different to what other competition shows do for ensemble performances.”
From Ashlee Simpson and Britney Spears to Milli Vanilli, numerous pop stars have been caught lip syncing over recent years but fans expect reality competitions to be more real than big budget stadium concerts and the mistake on Simon Cowell‘s new show has been slammed by fans online.
PHOTOS:  American Idol Runner-Ups
Just weeks into its first season, The X Factor has already been criticised for manipulating the audience after one contestant revealed he agreed to be cut because he wanted to “rock,” and another dropped his pants and flashed the judges during the early audition rounds.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, details revealed last week of finalist Stacy Francis‘ previous professional success conflict with the single mom sob story that she’s been selling on the show.

Ride Manufacturer Reveals The Cause Of Deadly Ohio State Fair Accident/n

What a tragedy.
As we previously reported, a day at the Ohio State Fair had a disastrous end when one of the amusement rides broke apart resulting in the death of 18-year-old Tyler Jarrell and the injury of countless others. So what exactly caused this tragic situation??
Related: Twitter Reacts To Chris & Anna's Separation News
Well, according to the manufacturer of the Fire Ball ride, the 20-year-old machine's break down was caused by "excessive corrosion." In a recent statement, KMG International's Albert Kroon revealed investigators ruled that "excessive corrosion on the interior of the gondola support beam dangerously reduced the beam's wall thickness over the years."
This led to the ride's "catastrophic failure" — AKA spinning out of control and shooting people into the air. Kroon also shared that the company has vowed to "develop an inspection protocol" in order to prevent future tragedies.
Hopefully, this update gives the victims and their loved ones some form of closure.

Scott Disick and Model Ella Ross Spotted Out Together Several Times/n
Is something going on between Scott Disickand British model Ella Ross?The two have been spotted out together several times over the past couple of days. They were seen walking in Beverly Hills Thursday. The following afternoon, they were seen having lunch together at Nobu in Malibu. On Friday night, they were photographed leaving the TAO club in Hollywood along with his friend and rapper French Montana. Scott and Ella have not commented.A source told E! News recently that Scott has been "hanging out with a few girls, but it's very casual," adding, "He's going out less and having people over at his house. French Montana just moved next door to Scott, and they are pretty close and hanging out." 

Scott and Ella were photographed together soon after E! News confirmed his ex Kourtney Kardashian, who broke up with him in 2015 and with whom he shares three kids, has been seeing former boxer Younes Bendjima. Another source told E! News "it's been casual, but they are really getting to know each other and having fun."

"Scott doesn't like Kourtney dating Younes at all," the source added. "He doesn't want to see photos of them or know about it. Kourtney has tried to give Scott a heads up that he might be seeing photos, but Scott can't stand seeing her with someone else, especially Younes."Another insider close to Scott said the reality star "gets really jealous when he sees or hears about Kourtney with anyone," adding, "He'll always love her, regardless of their status."

‘My Squad!’ Mariah Carey and Twins Strike a Pose Backstage While Prepping for NYC Show/n
Mariah Carey and her mini-Mimi’s look so cute!
The 47-year-old Grammy winner shared a sweet photo on Instagram of herself with her 6-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe ahead of her New York City concert with music legend Lionel Richie.
In the pic, the “Fantasy” singer struck a sexy pose while her children showcased their own cool poses, standing atop concert-equipment containers for the Madison Square Garden event.
Ever the fashionista, Carey wore a long-sleeve black and white mini dress for the shot — accessorizing her look with gold heels and matching shades. Moroccan played it cool in black jeans, a white T-shirt, and blue high-tops. Monroe, meanwhile, rocked a silver floral dress and black flats.
“#mysquad #curlyhaircrew#newark #allthehitstour getting ready for you #nyc,” Carey wrote in the caption for the cute snap.

The songstress has graced fans with many other adorable pics of her children — who have been accompanying her on the road alongside Richie as they travel for their All The Hits tour. And the twins have even joined Carey on stage a few times, singing along with their mom on her the chorus of her 1996 tune, “Always Be My Baby.”
After Carey’s concert at the BB&T Center in Fort Lauderdale on Aug. 10, the trio headed to a candy-themed party at the Sugar Factory American Brasserie on Ocean Drive in Miami, Florida.
She also shared a photo with pal Serena Williams — who is expecting her first child with fiancé Alexis Ohanian — who stopped by Carey’s concert and visited with the three backstage.
“With the beautiful @serenawilliams backstage tonight 😘,” Carey wrote.
While in Florida, she also threw a  treasure hunt on a boat for the kids — and they all got decked out in pirates costumes.

While not all of the original shows were able to be rescheduled — “We did our best,” Richie wrote on social media — tickets for the rescheduled dates will be honored and refunds are available at point of purchase.

Addiction & Heartbreak! Demi Moore Writing Tell-All Book/n
Demi Moore is penning a tell-all book, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
According to an insider, the Ghost star will concentrate on her rise up through the ranks in Hollywood and how proud she is of her three daughters with 62-year-old Bruce Willis.
However, she will NOT be slamming former husbands Willis and Ashton Kutcher.
Moore, 54, infamously had a meltdown after Kutcher, 39, left her for his second wife Mila Kunis, 33.

But a source claimed that the famous actress is not interested in dishing the dirt.
The source reveals: “This will be more about Demi’s rise to the top in acting, how she dragged herself up by her bootstraps after a difficult childhood, plus the amicable relationship she still maintains with Bruce Willis.”
Despite the affect the split with Kutcher had on her Moore is no longer bitter about it and is currently doing well in her life.

The source adds: “She’s got no desire to bash Ashton – or Mila – so suggestions that’s her M.O. are wide off the mark.
“Anyone who knows Demi will tell you she’s been open to a friendship with Ashton but it’s Mila who won’t allow it. She’s in a really good place right now, and looking forward to getting her story out there in a positive way.”

lady (Michelle Obama was 44 when she moved into the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy was 31, and Frances Folsom was 21 when she married 49-year-old Grover Cleveland in 1886, who was already president). The 24-year age difference between POTUS.../n
Melania Trump couldn't have imagined, when she met Donald Trump in 1998, two years after relocating to New York from Europe, that it was all leading up to this moment. She had about a year, after all, until the speculation started.Other than Bill Clinton, we haven't heard much this campaign season about the candidates' spouses. That should change soon as the field rapidly narrows and the country zeroes in on who it wants as its next commander in chief. But while plenty of information about the likes of Heidi Cruz, Jeanette Rubio and Jane Sanders is a few clicks away, we've got a singular head start on the third Mrs. Trump. And yet…at first glance she seems a mystery.The public-private paradox, if you will.



Robin Platzer/Twin Images

The Slovenian model (born Melanija Knavs) willingly entered into an even more public life by marrying Trump, but she still seems to be a very private person—and one whose determination to stay private could end up at odds with just how public she will soon be forced to go should her husband continue to rack up delegates.After what he would definitely characterize as a romp through Super Tuesday, Trump could very well be the Republican candidate for the presidency come November.

Trump critics are angling to point out seeming anomalies about his marital situation that would clash with the country's highest office; but really, Melania wouldn't be breaking that much ground. Turning 46 in April, she wouldn't be the youngest first lady (Michelle Obama was 44 when she moved into the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy was 31, and Frances Folsom was 21 when she married 49-year-old Grover Cleveland in 1886, who was already president). The 24-year age difference between POTUS and FLOTUS wouldn't be the greatest (again, looking at you Cleveland). She's not the first not-first wife, Ronald Reagan having been a divorcé when he married Nancy. She wouldn't even be the first to be born outside the U.S. (sixth President John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa, was born in London).



GQ

And while Melania would be the first FLOTUS who once appeared nude on the cover of British GQ, or posed for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue as well as on a Vogue cover with the headline "How to Marry a Millionaire" and pregnant in a bikini for Vogue in 2006, she wouldn't be the first model wife of a world leader. Many politicians abroad have married glamorously, perhaps most famously former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose wife Carla Bruni is a recording star and model.

And not all first ladies are as visible are Hillary Clinton was or Michelle Obama is, so Melania wouldn't necessarily need to become something she's not. But who is she?



Ron Galella/WireImage

The New York Times asked her in 1999, six years before she and Trump were even married, what sort of first lady she envisioned herself being should…well, should that come about one day."I would be very traditional. Like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy," the 26-year-old model said. "I would support him."



Art Rickerby/Time & Life Pictures/Getty Images

Asked again, 13 years later, by Refinery 29 how she would feel about being first lady if her husband should run for president, Melania laughed. (Presumably she wasn't the only one—but why did it take so long for people to realize he was for real again? This was in 2012.)"Well, you never know what could happen," she said. "My life is very busy. I'm very busy, as you know, as a businesswoman, as a mother, as a wife, as a social for charities. So my life is very busy, and that's it for now. I don't think about being first lady."

Better yet, she told the Daily Mail in 2013 (when asked if they might have more kids), "We are happy and my hands are full with my two boys—my big boy and my little boy!"Fast-forward to the day after her big boy secured his 319th delegate…



John Moore/Getty Images

Melania has only tweeted twice since her husband announced his candidacy last June, prayers for Charleston, S.C., and a celebratory 4th of July pic. She's been a quiet presence at the debates and, while she memorably said in November that her husband would be "the best president ever," we're more likely to see Trump's son Eric and other campaign advisers at his side while the GOP front-runner is behind a podium.

Before the occasional campaign sightings, the Trumps were frequent fixtures at society events in New York, and when contestants on The Apprentice were offered a peek at their lifestyle, Melania would be the one to greet visitors to their gilded Trump Tower penthouse, gracious and professional every time.And by all of the couple's accounts, theirs is a life of happily married domestic bliss. For all of Trump's unconventional rhetoric on the campaign trail, he's never had a cross word to say about his wife. As we know by now, it wouldn't be his way to suggest that his life is anything less than a raging success, but perhaps…they're just as thrilled with each other as they claim to be.Here's what we know:



Peter Kramer/Getty Images/for MSKCC

They're the parents of 9-year-old son Barron together, the youngest of Trump's five children, and Melania took on the role of full-time mom from day one, so the rigors of the presidential race wouldn't have done much to upset that balance of responsibilities."He didn't change diapers and I am completely fine with that," Melanie told Parenting.com. "It is not important to me. It's all about what works for you. It's very important to know the person you're with. And we know our roles. I didn't want him to change the diapers or put Barron to bed. I love every minute of it."

Asked what her average day was like, she said, "I am a full time mom; that is my first job. The most important job ever. I started my business when he started school. When he is in school I do my meetings, my sketches, and everything else. I cook him breakfast. Bring him to school. Pick him up. Prepare his lunch. I spend the afternoon with him. Sometimes I have obligations, but I also think children need to see a parent do what her passion is. It is a good example for a child. So the child can find passion as well and follow that passion in the future."She told Refinery 29 in 2012 that jeans are the single-most worn piece in her closet and "of course" she loves shoes.



Larry Busacca/Getty Images

Melania has a signature jewelry and watch collection for QVC (which would also be a first for a U.S. first lady) and, in 2013, she launched a skin care line. And while all of The Trump Foundation's charitable giving, ever, is as expected now under the microscope, she herself served as an American Red Cross Good Will Ambassador from 2005 until 2009, and has been a patron of The Boy's Club of New York and the Martha Graham Dance Company.



Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images

She told Refinery that she takes Barron to charity events that involve other children to show him "how some people love. I think it's best to show children through the eyes…they need to see and then they will have the memory."But while there's no doubt that Melania is a poised and polished woman who had her own high-profile modeling career and can talk at length about the subjects she's passionate about, who really knows how she feels about having to not just add sit-downs with CNN and MSNBC to her schedule, but also have to answer questions about what kind of man her husband is that wildly differ from the previous sorts of questions she probably was asked all the time about what sort of man he is.



Michael Loccisano/Getty Images

She may have told Refinery almost four years ago, "People say all sorts of stuff and they will talk but you just need to live your life," but what has easily been the wackiest presidential primary race in modern history seems to have created a whole new set of rules.Or has it?In an interview that ran in the February issue of Harper's Bazaar, Melania insisted that, while Trump's decision to run indeed was a family decision, she herself wouldn't be getting political in public.



Larry Busacca/Getty Images

"I'm very political in private life, and between me and my husband I know everything that is going on. I follow from A to Z," she told the magazine, whose cover she has graced in the past as a fashion model. "But I chose not to be on the campaign. I made that choice. I have my own mind. I am my own person, and I think my husband likes that about me." Surely he does, but the idea that she wouldn't have to get political in public was a lofty one."It's amazing what's going on, and we're having fun," Melania told Morning Joe's Mika Brzezinski in an interview that aired last week on MSNBC, in part echoing past comments of her husband's in which he seemed to be enjoying the journey (particularly the act of winning) more than planning what would happen upon arrival at the destination.

Asked about Trump's tough stance on immigration, as well as his call to temporarily halt Muslims from coming to the U.S., she explained, "What he said is it would be temporary, and it is not for all the Muslims. He wants to protect America. What's going on in the world...it's very dangerous, you have people coming into the country, and we don't know who they are, and what they will do."Also sounds in keeping with the party line, her husband being the party as Republicans reportedly scramble to come up with an 11th-hour plan to stop his seeming any-day-now as the GOP nominee. "Inevitable" is now the word being thrown around.Melania also said that her husband "treats women equal," despite criticism that he's a chauvinist with misogynistic tendencies based on comments he's made about Rosie O'Donnell, Megyn Kelly, Carly Fiorina and other women. "It's not woman or man," his wife insisted, "you are human."

"Do I agree with him all the time? No, and I tell him," Melania also said. "Sometimes he listens to my opinion, sometimes he doesn't."And yes, you don't see her that much on the campaign trail because she's trying to keep her son's life "as normal as possible."Then it was on to Anderson Cooper 360 this week, where she fielded questions about her husband calling Ted Cruz a "pussy" on the campaign trail in New Hampshire.

"He's with the momentum, he goes with the flow, he goes with the people," Melania said, adding that she knew at the time that it was all the media would seize on from that appearance. "They're having fun, everybody was cheering. And he said it and the next day— but he repeated the word [that someone else said]. That was not his word."She insists he would rein in the language if he were president."To build the empire and the business that he did, you can't always use that kind of tone," she said. "He could really change the words and the tone."And if he's elected, Melania told Cooper, "We are in the 21st century. I will be me. I will be different than any other first ladies. I will help women. I will help children. They are the future."Nineteen years removed from aspiring to be Jackie Kennedy, Melania Trump has proved, just as her husband did, that it's never wise to underestimate anybody.She'll be on Fox News tonight, in case you'd like to hear more.

'RHONY' Star Jules Weinstein's Frantic 911 Call: Fight With Husband Explodes!/n
Jules Wainstein called the cops on her estranged husband Michael on Wednesday after an explosive fight inside their Manhattan home — and RadarOnline.com has all the exclusive details!
“Jules started screaming at Michael early this morning,” a source close to the situation told Radar. “She was yelling at him, ‘I’m going to get you out of this house, just watch.’ She was livid.”
The source revealed that the fight escalated when 44-year-old Michael, who filed for divorce in May, was in the shower and Jules took his phone.
“He jumped out of the shower and got the phone back from her,’ the source told Radar. “Jules started screaming, ‘You hit me!'”

Jules, 35, then placed the phone call to 9-1-1.
The source said Michael then left their home to take their son, Jagger, to camp.
“She has a history of calling 9-1-1 in front of the kids,” the source told Radar. Jules last called the police on June 16, claiming she did not feel safe.
Officer Arlene Muniz in the New York City Public Information Office confirmed to Radar that the police were called to the apartment.

The incident report in the case read, “She stated her and her husband had a verbal argument. He began video recording her with his phone. He grabbed her by the arm and twisted it while he was standing on her feet so she could not move.”
“This was deemed harassment,” Officer Muniz told Radar, noting that Michael will not be arrested. “This did not constitute a crime because harassment isn’t a violation.”
“This is an attempt by Jules to paint a picture that she lives in a violent home for the judge for the hearing in September,” the source claimed. /n

Meet the Former High School Teacher Who Helped Create the First African-American Peanuts Character 47 Years Ago Today  /n
Franklin Armstrong, the first African-American member of the Peanuts gang, is turning 47 today – but if it wasn’t for a persistent former high school teacher, Charlie Brown’s best friend might’ve never joined the crew.  
When Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, Harriet Glickman, a retired Los Angeles teacher, was moved to action. “Like so many others, I felt helpless and like I had to do something,” she tells PEOPLE.  
So she decided to write a letter to some of the most popular cartoonists of the time – one of them being Charles Shulz, the creator of Peanuts – to “talk to them about what it would be like for a black child to see themselves in a comic strip.”  
Glickman admits she never expected a response, joking that the letter she sent out, which now sits in the Charles Shulz museum in California, was “quite long.”  
To her surprise, she received two replies. One cartoonist rejected the idea, saying he was afraid his strip would be dropped from publication if he drew an African-American character. The other response came from Charles Shulz, who said he liked the idea, but worried African-Americans might feel the character was patronizing.  
Determined to prove to Shulz that African-American families would welcome the inclusion, Glickman asked if she could run his “dilemma” by some of the very people he was afraid of offending.  
Shulz wrote back that he’d welcome their opinions, but again stressed his concern that he “would receive the same sort of criticism that would make it appear as if I were doing this in a condescending manner.”  
Flooded with letters from fans urging the cartoonists to integrate his strip, Schulz eventually changed his mind. On July 1, the cartoonist wrote back to Glickman, “You’ll be pleased to see the character in the strip in the week of July 29.”  
“That was pretty exciting,” she says.   
Twentieth Century Fox
In the July 31 funny papers, Franklin Armstrong was born. Glickman remembers the comic “had a huge effect. When people saw it there were a lot of positive reactions.”  
Newspapers, magazines and even pastors praised Schulz’s show of racial solidarity in the coming weeks – but the reaction was far from universally popular.   
Glickman remembers that during the period of public school integration, some Southern publications asked Schulz not to show African-American and white characters in the same classroom.  
The former high school teacher says that even United Features Syndicate asked Schulz if he was sure about the idea, to which she says he responded, “either you print it as I draw it, or I quit.”  
Glickman says Shulz “was so well known and so loved, that he had the courage to do” what others wouldn’t.  
Much to her regret, Glickman never met the cartoonist, who died in 2000. But after his death, she did visit his studio, which she describes as “an almost spiritual experience. To see where he drew the strip, and read my letter, it was a very personal reaction that I had.”  
Franklin, who Glickman says became almost like a son to her over the years, became an integral part of the Peanuts crew, and will be featured in FOX’s The Peanuts Movie, opening in 3D Nov. 6.

Here are all the films headed your way!

Fall is nearly here! Before you know it, it’ll be awards season again. But first, there’s a cavalcade of new and exciting films making their way to the multiplex and vying for your attention. We’ve taken the liberty of rounding up all the buzz-worthy titles to get you primed!

Sully (Sept. 9)
This biopic from director Clint Eastwood tells the story of Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), who became a hero after gliding his plane along the water in the Hudson River, saving the crew and passengers on board. The film also explores what happens after the events, including the investigation into Sully’s actions. Sully also stars Anna Gunn, Laura Linney and Aaron Eckhart.





Blair Witch (Sept. 16)
Those clever filmmakers disguised this sequel while it was being made, calling it The Woods, but at this year’s Comic-Con it was revealed that the film is indeed a follow-up to the 1999 indie horror gem The Blair Witch Project. The plot follows James (James Allen McCune), who is the brother of Heather from the first Blair Witch. He takes a group of friends into the demonic woods to try to figure out what happened to his sister – and then they experience it all for themselves. The trailer is creeepy!





Snowden (Sept. 16)
For his next film, director Oliver Stone has set his sights on telling the compelling story of Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower who leaked thousands of classified documents to the press, exposing how the US intelligence community can basically spy on anyone at any time. Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, we see Snowden become one of the NSA’s top analysts and how the work weighed heavily on him as his moral and ethical lines were blurred. The film also stars Shailene Woodley, Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson and more.





The Magnificent Seven (Sept. 23)
As a remake of the 1960 film (which, in turn, was an American version of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai), the story is the same: The denizens of a small Western town pay hired guns to try to rid themselves of a sadistic criminal (Peter Sarsgaard) and his gang who are terrorizing them. Now, if they are going to redo a Western classic, then The Magnificent Seven is a good choice, especially with an all-star cast including Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D’Onofrio, Haley Bennett and a stellar director like Antoine Fuqua (Training Day).





Storks (Sept. 23)
From the makers of The Lego Movie comes the animated film Storks, where in a twist, storks have moved on from delivering babies to delivering packages. Junior (Andy Samberg), the company’s top delivery stork, is about to be promoted when he accidentally activates the Baby Making Machine, producing an adorable baby girl, who also doesn’t have a family to go to. To cover up the blunder, Junior asks his human friend Tulip (Katie Crown) to help him deliver the baby somewhere, anywhere. The two, with baby in tow, embark on a wild journey that could make more than one family whole and restore the storks’ true mission in the world.  The other vocal talent includes Ty Burrell, Jennifer Aniston, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele and Kelsey Grammer.





Deepwater Horizon (Sept. 30)
Based on real-life events, this looks like it will be one of those films that will stick with you long after it ends. On April 20, 2010, the world’s largest man-made disaster occurred on the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion on the rig killed 11 crewmen and ignited a fireball that could not be extinguished and on April 22, it sank, leaving the well still gushing for another three months and causing the largest oil spill in US waters. Directed by Peter Berg, Deepwater Horizon shines a light on the brave men and women who saved many on board and stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Gina Rodriguez, Dylan O’Brien and Kate Hudson.





Masterminds (Sept. 30)
This comedy gathers the likes of Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig, Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis to pull off what looks like one helluva hilarious heist movie. Inspired by true events and directed by Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite), the story follows David (Galifianakis), an armored car driver bored with his life transporting millions of dollars around. But when he meets Kelly Campbell (Wiig), he find himself lured into the heist of a lifetime. Except, David finds himself double crossed and has to go on the lam, while a hitman (Sudeikis) tries to catch him.





Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children (Sept. 30)
Oh, Tim Burton! You’ve found yourself another perfect project with the wickedly wild and magical Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. Based on the best-selling novel, Jake (Asa Butterfield) discovers an alternate universe and meets Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) at her secret Home for Peculiar Children, where the residents all have unusual abilities. But Jake soon learns he, too, has special gifts. However, there are powerful, hidden enemies ready to destroy it all. Jake must figure out who is real, who can be trusted, and who he really is.





Birth of a Nation (Oct. 7)
Written, directed and starring Nate Parker, this film takes a look at the 1831 slave rebellion, instigated and organized by Nat Turner after experiencing and witnessing years of oppression on a Southern plantation. The epic drama, which won the Grand Jury prize as the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, originally had Oscar contender written all over it, but the current real-life controversy surrounding Parker and a rape charge when he was in college, may dampen its chances. Still, it’s a powerful trailer.





The Girl on the Train (Oct. 7)
Based on the best-selling page turner from Paula Hawkins, the story centers on Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt), a emotionally damaged woman who is struggling with life after her divorce. Every day, she takes the train in to work in New York, which passes by her old house in which her ex-husband (Justin Theroux) and new wife (Rebecca Ferguson) now live. However, two doors down lives Megan and Scott (Haley Bennett and Luke Evans) a couple with whom Rachel is enraptured. She fantasizes about their perfect life from her spot on the train. That is, until Rachel sees something that shatters her illusions – and Megan goes missing the next day. It also stars Allison Janney and Édgar Ramírez.





The Accountant (Oct. 14)
It might be a stretch, but Ben Affleck as a genius mathematician savant/accountant who cooks the books for a crime syndicate is this film’s premise. But when he decides to go legit and un-cook some of those books to discover an awful truth, the body count rises. Directed by Warrior helmer Gavin O’Connor, the thriller co-stars Anna Kendrick, Jeffrey Tambor and John Lithgow.





Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (Oct. 21)
In this sequel, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name. On the run as a fugitive from the law, Reacher uncovers a potential secret from his past that could change his life forever. Directed by Edward Zwick, the actioner also co-stars Cobie Smulders.





Keeping Up with the Joneses (Oct. 21)
It’s a Zach Galifianakis kind of season! Here’s another comedy he is starring in, in which he and his wife (Isla Fisher) find out their seemingly perfect new neighbors (Gal Gadot and Jon Hamm) are actually government spies. Soon the suburban couple find themselves embroiled in an international espionage plot. Let the hilarity ensue.





Inferno (Oct. 28)
As his alter ego Robert Langdon, Tom Hanks reunites with director Ron Howard to solve another mind-bender in order to stop a global pandemic in the third installment in the Dan Brown series. After waking up in an Italian hospital with memory loss, the famous symbologist ends up on a trail of clues tied to the great Dante himself. He teams up with Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), a doctor he hopes will help him recover his memories. Together, they race across Europe and against the clock to stop a madman from unleashing a global virus that would wipe out half of the world’s population.





Doctor Strange (Nov. 4)
Benedict Cumberbatch always seemed perfect to play the Marvel Comic character Doctor Strange, a prominent but arrogant surgeon, who nearly loses his life, yet is given a second chance when he is taken in by a mystic sorcerer named the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) to learn the tricks of the trade in order to fight evil. Honestly, this looks like a cross between The Matrix and Inception. It also stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen and Rachel McAdams.





Hacksaw Ridge (Nov. 4)
In the latest directorial effort from Mel Gibson, this WWII drama shines a light on the true story of Cpl.

 Kandi Burruss' Wild Bachelorette Party: All The Details Of The Two-Part Shindig, Including.../n
Kandi Burruss may now be a happily married woman, but RadarOnline.com is exclusively reporting that The Real Housewives of Atlanta star celebrated a wild and fun bachelorette party on March 29, 2014 prior to tying the know with Todd Tucker.
Radar got the chance to catch up with the hostess of Burruss’ bachelorette party, her RHOA costar Phaedra Parks, and got all the inside scoop on the night’s festivities.
PHOTOS: Kandi Burruss’ Wild Bachelorette Party Pics
“The party was a two-part party and we had our entertainment and our fun and games,” Parks told Radar. “A lot of the games were centered around Kandi’s product line, ‘Bedroom Kandi,’ so there were some very risqué games.”
One game involved granny panties.

“They played some funny games with panties: trying on panties and getting out of panties,” Parks said. “It was how fast you can get out of them. Everyone played that game. It was hilarious.”
Another game gaged the size of each partygoer’s mouth.

“It was a bunch of games of ‘How big is your mouth?’” Parks said.
Burruss also had some special entertainment in the form of female strippers.

“They wanted to do something different, so I found a lot of fun, fetish ladies who really embodied the wild side of every woman,” Parks said. “They didn’t want guys; they wanted just very interesting ladies. So we had a little person and we had a very big person.”
And the dancers made sure to put on a show.

“We had a mishap with one of our tables that one of our little dancers was dancing on it,” Parks said. “She fell. The table actually broke during the routine.”
Parks even give Burruss some dollar bills for the strippers.

“I made sure that I got Kandi a hundred $1.00s, so that she could tip,” she said. “I got $500 in ones so that we could [all] tip the dancers.”
One dancer even put on a sexy show using dairy products.

“It was hilarious because one of the dancers — the plus size lady — danced in a tub of blue milk,” Parks said. “That was quite a hit.”
While most women might be embarrassed by such performances, Parks said that Burruss loved the evening.

“I think it’s quite hard to shock Kandi,” she said. “She is an entrepreneur who has a sex toy line and she’s not easily embarrassed.”
Celebrity guests at the first part of the festivity included recently divorce Porsha Williams, Rasheeda, Aunt Nora and Burruss’ mother-in-law in addition to about 50 other people for the first part of the party, Parks revealed.

Guests were treated to an open bar and a wide selection of hors d’oeuvres including “shrimp, sliders, a salmon pate, a garden salad, and a radicchio leaf with goat cheese,” Parks said. “They were great hors d’oeuvres.”
After the first part of the party ended, a smaller group of about 10 people headed to Compound, a hot club in Atlanta.
“We had a private area there and bottle service,” Parks said. “I think Kandi may have even enjoyed a glass of champagne there.”

 Drug-Smuggling Granny On Death Row In Bali 'Could Be Executed Within Weeks,' Can't Afford.../n
After being handed down a shocking death sentence last month for smuggling cocaine to Bali, a British grandmother expected to have years of appeals ahead of her before she ever risked facing a firing squad, could be executed within weeks, RadarOnline.com is reporting.
Lindsay June Sandiford, 56, from Gloucestershire, England, is being held at Kerobokan Jail after being arrested at the airport last May following 10.6 pounds of cocaine, worth $2.5 million, being discovered in the lining of her suitcase — however she maintains that she was forced to take the drugs into the country by a gang that was threatening to hurt her children.
PHOTOS: Sexy Stars Who Have Been Arrested 
Indonesia expressed this week its intention to resume executions for the first time since 2008, and Government officials have revealed that Sandiford’s high-profile conviction is what led to the deadly decision, reported the UK’s Independent.
Basrief Arief, who was sworn in as the country’s Attorney General last November, expressed his desire to shorten both the appeals process and increase executions now that he has taken office, which is bad news for the British granny and the 12 other inmates currently on death row.
PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots
The deadline for Sandiford to lodge her appeal is February 12 but she is currently struggling to afford a lawyer after being turned down for legal support by the British Foreign Office.
“It is deeply disappointing that the Foreign Office chose to fight against helping Lindsay in the British courts, rather than fighting for her in Indonesia,” said Harriet McCulloch, spokesperson for nonprofit human rights campaigners Reprieve.
PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Done Jail Time
“Lindsay has under two weeks in which to file an appeal against her death sentence — which means dealing with complicated legal documents in Indonesian, a language she does not understand. She has no money for a lawyer, and time is running out.”
While Sandiford got a much harsher sentence than the 15 years prosecutors requested, the man who arranged to meet her to pick up the mountain of drugs only got six years in prison for his part in the trafficking ring.
PHOTOS: Celebrity Death Threats
Julian Ponder, of Brighton, England, was found guilty on January 29 of possessing narcotics and faced a possible life sentence after 23 grams of cocaine were found in his villa when he was arrested.
“I think it’s light enough,” said his lawyer, Ary Sunardi, after hearing the sentence that was one year less than what the prosecution recommended.

Chelsea Handler Told A ‘Complete And Blatant Lie’/n
Chelsea Handler’s feud with Jennifer Aniston is nothing new to her former co-star Heather McDonald, who is still feeling the burn from their bitter battle, and she drops the bombshell news that her nemesis told a “complete and blatant lie,” about the situation.
Handler, 42, and Aniston, 48, have ended their high profile friendship, diving their A-list group in half and sending shock waves through Hollywood, but McDonald knows firsthand how brutal her ex-boss can be.
“It was the most upsetting thing that has ever happened to me, career wise,” McDonald said this week on Reality Steve’s podcast, opening up about the fight that began when she said she lived in fear of her boss while filming the E! show.

Handler fired back on the Howard Stern show, claiming McDonald was selling stories about her to US Weekly.
McDonald ripped Handler on the podcast, saying her statement “was a complete and blatant lie,” and that there was “no proof to it. I don’t know why she said it. I don’t know if someone said it to her. I don’t know if she made it up that day. But it was a lie.”
She explained Handler’s “lie,” was “career debilitating. It was very very bad for me. In Hollywood people believed it.”
The backlash was intense she told Reality Steve. “Other than losing someone, a death, it was the most traumatic thing I’ve ever been through. I’ve never gotten hate before really. It was just bombarded hate.”

Bonnie Tyler Previews Her ‘Total Eclipse of the Heart’ Performance on CNN in Advance of Actual Eclipse/n
CNN took time out of its eclipse coverage on Monday to interview Bonnie Tyler and ask the “Total Eclipse of the Heart” singer about her favorite line from the ’80s hit.
Anchor John Berman asks the singer awkward questions like, “How do you think a total eclipse of the heart differs from a total eclipse of the sun?” and “Can you stare into a total eclipse of the heart without glasses?” A bewildered Tyler fields them with grace, saying that the song is “evergreen” and “everybody loves to see it.”
Then we get to the good part: Tyler singing her favorite part of the song, the chorus. Watch the singer belt the song (and fight to keep hair from blowing into her face) below.

Rebel Wilson is taking a stand.

The Pitch Perfect 2 star won her defamation case against Bauer Media Group — a company that owns publications like In Touch, Life & Style, and Women’s World — two years after a series of damning articles were published.
During the three-week trial, which reached a verdict Thursday (June 15, 2017) by an all-female jury, Rebel and her attorneys argued the company’s tabloids portrayed her as a serial liar who had lied about her age and other personal details. She claimed the articles had damaged her reputation so much that she allegedly lost out on two roles.

“Just crushed my defamation case in Australia x thank you to all my family, friends and supporters! I had to take a stand. I had to stand up to a bully, a media organization Bauer Media Group who maliciously took me down in May 2015 with a series of grubby and completely false articles,” she wrote on Instagram. “Far too often tabloid magazines and the ‘journalists’ who work for them don’t abide by professional ethics. Far too often their conduct can only be described as disgraceful and disgusting!”
“I’m glad that the lovely ladies of the jury have agreed with me. Their unanimous and overwhelming verdict has sent a clear message,” she continued. “I love my job as an actress and as an entertainer and I look forward to rebuilding my career now that the record has been set straight. Thank you so much everybody!”

  Will New Film Free Pamela Smart? Convict Who Convinced Her Teen Lover To Kill Her Husband.../n
Pamela Smart’s diabolical plan to have her 16-year-old lover, William “Billy” Flynn, kill her husband was immortalized in the 1995 Nicole Kidman movie To Die For — and now the former New Hampshire school administrator is hopeful a new film could help get her life sentence commuted.
“If I didn’t get involved with Bill Flynn, then my husband would probably still be alive, and that’s something I have to live with,” Pamela tells People of the crime. “But the person who murdered him is getting out next year while I’m stuck in here for the rest of my life.”
PHOTOS: Sick And Sadistic, The World’s Most Evil Serial Killers
The HBO documentary Captivated: The Trials of Pamela Smart, set to air on August 18, will detail how Flynn, who fired the fatal shot that killed 24-year-old Gregg Smart in 1990, is up for parole in just months while two of his three teen conspirators have already been out of jail for years.
Smart, now 46, has been incarcerated for over two decades, and she notes that the discrepancy between her sentence and those of the other men involved in the crime “just doesn’t seem fair.”
She’s hopeful that others will come to the same conclusion after watching the documentary — especially since she has no more legal options left in the fight to reduce her time in prison, which she refers to as “worse than death.”
PHOTOS: The Face Of Evil: The Top 32 Most Terrifying Serial Killers
Despite Smart’s guarded optimism, others take a very different view of the situation.
“There has never been credible information presented to warrant consideration of a pardon,” insists New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan.
The victim’s brother, Dean, couldn’t agree more, and he disregards Smart’s belief that Flynn murdered her husband in retaliation for her breaking off their sordid affair.
“We all believed that these boys would never have done this on their own,” he reveals. “I believe the sentence was fair.”
Whatever the case, says Smart, “I don’t know any person who would want their whole life to be defined by one bad choice.” /n

It’s incredible how many things have changed in just 10 years.

A decade ago, the People’s Choice Awards was a totally different place: Miley Cyrus was just a Disney Channel star with hair past her shoulders. Cameron Diaz was a brunette. Heroes beat out Ugly Betty for Best TV Drama. Robin Williams was still alive.

 Kim Kardashian Admits, ‘In A Perfect World I Would Love To Be Divorced’ From Kris.../n
Kim Kardashian is the first to admit that getting pregnant with her boyfriend, Kanye West’s baby, while still married to Kris Humphries, isn’t exactly ideal!
In an interview with Shade 45’s Sway in the Morning show, the 32-year-old reality star, who was joined by her older sister, Kourtney, opened up about her pregnancy in regards to her ongoing divorce drama with her NBA star husband, and RadarOnline.com has the details.
PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian Channels Sophia Loren
“In a perfect world of course I would love to be divorced,” Kim, who dominated the interview, admitted when asked about the scenario. “It is going on its second year. And that’s really tough just because I want to move on with my life.”
Kim, who opened up about her fertility problems for the first time during an interview with TODAY on Tuesday, is upset that people have such a problem with her situation.
PHOTOS: Kim Shows Off Bikini Body
“When people say things like why are you having a baby when you’re married to someone else… If someone really knew all the fertility problems and the things that I was going through,” Kim said. “God brings you things at a time when you least expect it. I am such a planner and this was just meant to be.”
She continued, “What am I gonna do? Wait years to get divorced? It’s such a process. Technically we are legally separated.”
PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian Wears Tights And No Make-up At A Nail Salon
When asked about Humphries’ thoughts on the divorce, Kim denied that there was any fraud involved in their union.
“I can’t really speak like for him. I think the facts are I filed for divorce, he is suing me for an annulment and the only legal way to ever get annulment if there is fraud involved,” she said.
PHOTOS: Kim Kardsashian In Harper’s Bazaar
“He is claiming that I frauded [sic] him to marry him for publicity. For me, who would ever do that? It’s just not who I am?”
Kim maintains that she did, in fact, love her husband, and that she ended the relationship because she realized that he was not the right person for her.

“He was someone that I loved a lot but you can love someone a lot and then realize they are not the right person for you,” she insisted. “And I would have rather ended it when I felt that way then waste a year of my life not being happy. For him too.”
She was also aware that her actions would not go over well in regards to her public image.

“I knew the whole world was going to bash me. I knew that. And I said to myself, ‘What is more important? My life and my happiness or what the whole world thinks about me?’” Kim concluded.
“That would be vain. That would be fake. That would be doing it for publicity. I could have stayed married.”

French manicured nails prominently displayed, Snooki sings her little heart out to Spears’ “Sometimes”.

Royals Visit Fire Ravaged Town; Next Stop, Calgary, Then Hollywood!/n
By Radar Staff
One day after visiting a town destroyed by fire, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate, continue their Canadian tour on Thursday in Calgary, Alberta; then on Friday, it’s on to Hollywood!
Their agenda includes a visit to the University of Calgary’s Ward of the 21st Century Research and Innovation Centre; a government reception in their honor at BMO Centre at Stampede Park; and a wreath-laying ceremony at Rotary Challenger Park.
On Wednesday, the caring couple ventured far from the luxuries of Buckingham Palace, visiting a town ravaged by a May wildfire.

The Royal pair dressed down for the trip to Slave Lake in Northern Alberta, which was destroyed by the natural disaster in May 2011.
While their heartfelt visit was welcomed, they kept details secret until the last moment to ensure their presence did not disrupt relief efforts.

“It wasn’t a last-minute decision,” said Canadian secretary to the Queen, Kevin MacLeod. “Their overwhelming concern was that they did not want a public announcement early on for fear that it would somehow detract from those people who are now putting in place all the reconstruction efforts.”
William and Kate arrived on a private jet and were met by dignitaries before being led through the devastation complete with burned out cars and demolished buildings.

They also spent more than an hour meeting the victims of the wildfire which destroyed more than 40 percent of the town.
The newlyweds personally requested the visit to Slave Lake as part of their Canadian tour.
The royals begin their much-anticipated 3-day trip to California beginning Friday, and RadarOnline.com will be there to capture all of the action for you.

These Are the Hangers Jean Queen Khloé Kardashian Relies on to Organize Her Denim
/n

As the mastermind behind Good American, a curve-inclusive line of jeans feautring an array of super trendy styles of pants, shorts, skirts, jackets, and even bodysuits, it should go without saying that Khloé Kardashian has a pretty robust denim wardrobe. Aside from her personal collection, the reality star also owns pretty much every possible style of pant from every denim brand that exists. And given that she’s a bit obsessive when it comes to organizing, naturally all of those pieces are also perfectly placed and curated. In her latest post on her website and app, the jean queen deigned to share her masterful tips so we can all finally get that towering pile of denim finally under control.
Lauren / Splash News Online
The Good American designer starts off the post saying, “I have A LOT of denim these days—so, honey, you KNOW I have an elaborate system for keeping it organized in tip-top Khlo-C-D shape! It can be tricky to keep your jeans neat and accessible. No. 1 enemy? Folded stacks of jeans. Closet MVP? Chrome Slack Hangers.”

According to Khloé, these simple half-open hangers are the only trick you need to take your closet from tragic to trés magnifique. “Hanging my jeans (rather than folding them) allows me to pull out a pair without f***ing up the PERFECT system I’ve got going on, LOL,” she says. “Slack hangers allow you to see the full leg and waistband of your jeans, so you basically know what everything is without having to pull it all out. These slim chrome hangers are also genius for space saving.”

Finally, Khloé explains that, “Color coding is essential.” That means if you don’t have a complete rainbow of denim in your wardrobe, you’re doing it wrong. “I separate my white denim from my black denim and separate THAT from my denim denim (lol), which is organized from light wash to dark wash,” she explains. In case those meticulously stacked jars of Oreos in her kitchen didn’t already tip you off, she concludes,”Everything has got to have a system!”
What do you think of Khloé’s organizational hack? Will you try it? Sound off below!

The temps apparently haven't been very bon for Rutina Wesley lately.The True Blood star has filed for divorce from husband Jacob Fishel after more than eight years of marriage.She noted their date of separation as July 22 and cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split, according to court documents filed Friday in L.A. Superior Court and obtained by E! News.

The couple tied the knot on June 5, 2005, and did not have any children together. Wesley is also asking that the court not award Fishel spousal support. They met while both students at Julliard.Wesley, 34, plays Sookie Stackhouse's childhood friend Tara Thornton on True Blood, which capped off its revealing sixth season this past Sunday. And though she and Sookie have been on the outs, new vampire Tara's romantic future looks bright with Kristin Bauer's Pam—presuming Pam survived the fire that seemed to kill off (but couldn't possible have really killed off) Alexander Skarsgård's Eric.

Chris Christie Gets in a Cubs Fan's Face, 'You're a Big Shot' /nChris Christie wasn't having it this time with heckling fans at a baseball game over the weekend ... seeing how he got within inches of one guy's face.   At #Cubs #Brewers game. #ChrisChristie was getting razzed by fans, so he got in the face of one of them. 5:30 on @WISN12News pic.twitter.com /sx8euMgFy2 — Ben Hutchison (@BennyHutch) July 30, 2017  Christie was at Miller Stadium Sunday in Milwaukee for a Brewers-Cubs game, and this clip shows the tail end of what looks like a heated confrontation with a Cubs fan that luckily ended with just words.  You clearly hear the NJ governor tell the dude,  "You're a big shot " -- before he pulls back and continues down the steps ... nachos intact and all. Unclear what exactly set off the stare-down ... we haven't heard back from his office for comment.  As we reported ... Christie got destroyed by Mets fans earlier this month when he caught a foul ball and was showered in BOOOs. He also hasn't fared well on sports radio.  Seems like he's fed up with the ridicule lately﻿./n

Boost Memory And Brain Power With Natural Tips To Stop Aging In Its Tracks!/n
Turning back the clock doesn’t only result in more youthful-looking skin, as it could also prevent a decline in brainpower! Factors such as age, stress and nutrition could affect your ability to learn, remember and even focus. Yikes!
Nutrition and performance specialist Nora Tobin is here to help all of our busy and hard-working readers avoid brain fog!
Replace fried food and dessert with meals that contain omega-3 essential fatty acids such as salmon. Also snack on blueberries, pistachios, kale and anything rich in antioxidants to promote brain function.
Not only will increasing your human growth hormone levels boost your brain, but it will also produce wrinkle-free skin, strengthen bones and more!
“SeroVital-hgh, a specialized amino acid blend, has been shown to increase the body’s own production of hgh by a mean of 682 percent,” Tobin explained. “It does it naturally by encouraging the pituitary gland to produce hgh at more youthful levels.”

Will and Kate Take DJ Lessons Down Under/n

Will and Kate are greeted by men in thongs in New Zealand.

Prince William and Kate Middleton’s tour of Australia and New Zealand has placed them in several unnatural positions. For instance, making small talk with a man in a thong. But they were perhaps at their most awkward Wednesday when the two got DJ lessons at a youth center in Adelaide, Australia.
In case there was any question before, Will and Kate clearly don’t have a whole lot of nightclubbing experience. In fact I think we all know which royal this was really a job for. And where is Harry when you need him? God knows he’s spent more than one sunrise in a dark club, spinning “God Bless the Queen” or whatever they’re listening to in London nightclubs these days.
Anyway here’s video of the two taking their turn spinning. As you can see, Kate’s scratching is just slightly better than her husband’s, but I’m not encouraging anyone here to renounce their title in favor of a new career.

Shonda Rhimes "Had a Different Plan" for Callie Before Sara Ramirez' Grey's Anatomy Exit Feeling a little blindsided by Sara Ramirez's Grey's Anatomy exit?  You're not alone. While addressing the audience a.../n
Feeling a little blindsided by Sara Ramirez's Grey's Anatomy exit? You're not alone. While addressing the audience at Vulture Festival in New York on Sunday, creator Shonda Rhimes revealed that she only learned that Ramirez wanted to leave the show about three days before the actress hinted at the end of her run in a cryptic tweet. "That's a wrap for Doctor #CallieTorres #Season13 #GreysAnatomy #ThankYou all for an enriching & unforgettable #Rollercoaster ride!" she tweeted on April 28. At the time, ABC would not confirm or comment on Ramirez' status on the show, but the news of her departure officially broke just after the season 12 finale, in which Arizona presented Callie with a new custody plan and tickets to New York. Originally, that scene was not going to be her exit scene. "[Callie's exit] was interesting," Rhimes said. "It was different because it wasn't a big, planned thing. I had a different plan going and when Sara came and said, 'I really need to take this break,' I was sort of lucky that we had shot the end of the season with her going to New York." "I felt really good that we had shot that ending and that she said she wanted to take this break and we were able to give it to her because I love the woman and I want to do everything for her," Rhimes added. "It all worked out in that sense."

Ramirez joins Sandra Oh and Patrick Dempsey on the list of long-time Grey's Anatomy stars who have exited the series. "You never want to see anybody go—you want them to be there forever," Rhimes said. "I find it fascinating that people are shocked that people are exiting. Think about this—most shows go for four seasons? The number of dramas that have gone for four seasons is under 50, and we're heading into season 13. The idea that Sandra did it for 10 seasons and then was ready to go was amazing. I kept waiting. Season six, season seven, season eight, I was like, ‘Sandra, are you good?' Because I know what that is for an actor. You grow and change and then you itch for something new...you have to be really respectful of that."As for Derek's death at the end of season 11, Rhimes marveled at the rumors surrounding Dempsey's exit. "For Patrick, people make such a nasty deal of that whole thing and I'm like, ‘Why? I think people want a story on the outside that doesn't have to do with anything on the inside. That was a lot of seasons."As for when the show itself might end, Rhimes confirmed that Ellen Pompeo will make that decision. "Our pact is that we will go together. When she goes, I go." Hopefully, that's not for a while, because even after 12 seasons, we still can't get enough. Grey's Anatomy returns to ABC this fall.

Elizabeth Smart's Relief: 'This Is A Wonderful Day'/n
With her parents and sister by her side, a clearly relieved Elizabeth Smart smiled as she addressed reporters outside the court where her kidnapper Brian David Mitchell was found guilty of kidnapping on Friday.
“I would like to say thank you to everyone … this is a wonderful day and I am so thrilled to be here and so thrilled with the verdict,” the 23-year-old said after the verdict was delivered.  
SHOCKING PHOTOS: Elizabeth Smart Evidence In Kidnapping Case 
“I hope that this is not only an example that justice can be served in America, but that it is possible to move on after something terrible has happened, and that we can speak out and we will be heard.
“Thank you to everyone for everyone’s prayers and support.”
Her mother, Lois Smart, said: “Today is such a wonderful day … a victorious day for us all [for] mothers, women and daughters.  We can go forward.”
A jury in Salt Lake City, Utah found Mitchell guilty of interstate kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor to engage in sexual activity.
Smart was in the courtroom with her sister, Mary Katherine, and parents Ed and Lois, as she had been every day of the trial since her testimony. 
The family smiled when the verdict was read, witnesses reported.
PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots
Mitchell was present in the courtroom while the verdict was read, singing the LDS hymn “He Died. The Great Redeemer Died.”
While on the stand, the now 23-year-old Smart described the nine month horror she suffered at the hands of Mitchell and his wife Wanda Barzee, who is serving a 15-year sentence for Elizabeth’s kidnapping.  
Elizabeth was taken at knife point from her home on June 5, 2002 at the age of 14, held captive by Mitchell and raped daily during her ordeal.  
PHOTOS: Elizabeth Smart Leaves Courtroom 
She said she made a decision about how she would handle her dire situation.
“No matter what it took, I would live,” Smart testified. 
“I would survive and do everything he told me to do to keep my life and my family’s life intact.”

Smart has been serving on a Mormon mission in Paris, France for the last year and outside the court said “I am excited to go back to France and complete my mission.”

 ‘You The Jury’ Tackles Internet Troll: Benjamin Crump Seeks Justice For Horrified.../n
Sydney Shelton was horrified when her co-worker, Gerod Roth, posted a picture of her African-American son on Facebook with racist comments, and now RadarOnline.com has learned she is getting her day in court.
Judge Jeanine Pirro’s new legal show, You The Jury, is taking on the case in the second week.
“You knew it was going to be a daunting task,” attorney Benjamin Crump told Radar. (Crump represented Trayvon Martin’s family after he was killed by George Zimmerman.) “If you don’t stand up and speak for your children then no one else is going to do it.”
PHOTOS: Tears & Tantrums! 9 Shocking Moments From Jenelle’s Jury Trial
When Roth posted little Cayden’s picture on Facebook in 2015 without his mother’s permission or knowledge and called him “feral,” his group of friends chimed in with their own racist comments, including one writing, “I didn’t know you were a slave owner.”
Crump is representing Shelton against infamous Casey Anthony attorney Baez. He told Radar that her “emotions were real, fear for her child was real.”
“She sat face to face with the person who caused so much pain and it was very emotional. The emotions over took her. It was like real-life court.”
You The Jury allows American viewers the opportunity to decide the verdict with a five-minute voting window and results aired live. Crump says that he plans to watch the show in his office with family, friends and co-workers and hopes for the best outcome.

“I would tell you this: As a civil rights lawyer, it was interesting to me how authentic it was, going through the process,” he said. “It was very real.”
As for why Shelton decided to take her case to reality TV, Crump said, “If she doesn’t stand up right now and try to tell her son it’s not ok to let people make you a victim of racism then no one will.”
You The Jury airs at 9 p.m. EST on FOX.

Luann Gushes Over Married Life As Sleazy Tom Drools Over Old Flame Missy/n
Last night’s season finale of The Real Housewives of New York City highlighted the beginning of the end of Luann de Lessep’s marriage to her husband Tom D’Agostino.
While Luann presented her marriage as a happy one, it was clear by the end of the clip that D’Agostino was not on the same page.
As the episode kicked off, de Lesseps, in true de Lesseps fashion, couldn’t help but talk about how wonderfully married life was treating her.
“Tom and I have actually known each other all of a year and a half, so we’re still in our honeymoon phase,” she shared. “He’s just added so much to my life and it makes it complete.”
After the two finished up a tennis match, de Lesseps told D’Agostino she was excited about going to Tinsley Mortimer’s “Thank You” party for Sonja Morgan – who’d been letting the Southern socialite crash at her Upper East Side brownstone all winter.

“It’s gonna be fun because we can finally go to a party and not feel like everybody’s like talking about Lu and Tom,” de Lesseps said to D’Agostino as he nodded obligingly. “I’ve gotten to a place where I feel like everybody’s really happy for us and they’re settled with it, and it feels good.”
She continued praising her marriage to D’Agostino, explaining to the cameras, “After all we’ve been through, Tom’s still here, and that says everything. I was on a mission to make this work, and I did. And guess what? We’re happy, and I’m happy, and that’s all that matters.”
However, D’Agostino quickly left his wife’s side once the couple arrived at Mortimer’s party later on.
While Luann chatted with Bethenny Frankel and Dorinda Medley about — what else? — the joys of married life, her husband was busy chatting up his ex, Missy.
A few episodes back, Missy revealed to Ramona Singer that she had been dating D’Agostino before de Lesseps entered the picture. In fact, Missy only found out Tom was done with her when she walked in on him on a date with the Housewife at The Regency Hotel.

While de Lesseps stayed preoccupied, D’Agostino asked Missy if he could buy her drink. When she said no, Tom coughed. Missy jokingly asked, “What’s wrong with you? Are you sick?”
“I get all choked up when I see you,” he replied, before adding, “I can’t say that.”
The New York City businessman then decided to mention a moment from their past. “Last time I saw Missy she was walking off,” he said.
“Oh my god, yes! I totally forgot about that moment,” Missy laughed. “Wait, I want to hear your side of the story.”
D’Agostino wasted no time in agreeing to share the sordid details, but first he said he would have to de-mic. “All right, I’ve got to unplug this thing,” he said. “Hold on.”
Meanwhile, de Lesseps told Frankel and Medley how easy it was for her to drop the socialite lifestyle — and her Countess title — for D’Agostino. “I’m happy to be Mrs.,” she said.
PHOTOS: ‘RHONY’ Jules Wainstein Divorce Scandal Faked In Filming
However, it doesn’t seem like D’Agostino was ever that happy being her Mr.
As Radar readers know, de Lessep’s marriage was plagued by cheating rumors, and she was even allegedly seen slapping D’Agostino in a NYC restaurant. While confirmed they had a fight, she denied that it was anything more than a “lovers’ quarrel.”
Then, one week ago, de Lesseps announced she and D’Agostino were calling it quits after just seven months of marriage. She asked for privacy during this “sad time.”
What do you think D’Agostino said to Missy? Are you surprised he and de Lesseps couldn’t make their marriage work? Sound off in the comments below!

Ariana Grande Addresses Fans After Manchester Terror Attack Claims the Lives of at Least 22 Concertgoers/n





                    At Least 19 Dead After Explosion at Ariana Grande Concert
                







Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.

Ariana Grande is in disbelief after a suicide bomber killed at least 22 people and wounded 59 at the end of her concert in Manchester, England on Monday (May 22, 2017).

Grande, who was not injured by the explosion, issued a message on social media shortly after the terror attack took place.
“broken. from the bottom of my heart,” wrote the 23-year-old singer. “i am so so sorry. i don’t have words.”


broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words.
— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 23, 2017

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Reuters reports that experts say that there was no evidence of their direct involvement and that the details of the claim made by the group contrast with the British police account.
This is the deadliest attack on British soil since 52 people were killed in suicide bombings on London’s transport system in 2015. Prime minister Theresa May described the bombing as an “appalling act of terrorism” and has halted General Election campaigning until further notice. President Donald Trump extended his “deepest condolences” to the victims of the attack from Bethlehem, Israel, calling those behind the attack “evil losers.”
“We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives, murdered by evil losers in life. I won’t call them monsters because they would like that term,” said Trump. “They would think that’s a great thing. I will call them from now on – losers – because that’s what they are – they’re losers and we’ll have more of them. But that’s what they are – they’re losers. Just remember that.”
This is an excerpt from the official statement issued by Greater Manchester police [via Independent]:
“Families and many young people were out to enjoy a concert at the Manchester Arena and have lost their lives. Our thoughts are with those 22 victims that we now know have died, the 59 people who have been injured and their loved ones. We continue to do all we can to support them. They are being treated at eight hospitals across Greater Manchester.
This is a fast-moving investigation and we have significant resources deployed to both the investigation and the visible patrols that people will see across Greater Manchester as they wake up to the news of the events last night. This will include armed officers as people would expect. More than 400 officers have been involved in this operation during the night.
To remind you, we were called at 10:33pm to reports of an explosion at the Manchester Arena at the conclusion of an Ariana Grande concert. More than 240 calls came in and emergency services were very quickly on the scene. Emergency numbers have been established for anyone who is concerned for loved ones who may not have returned home 01618569400 or 01618569900.
We have been treating this as a terrorist incident and we believe that while the attack last night was conducted by one man the priority is to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network.
The attacker, I can confirm, died at the arena. We believe the attacker was carrying an improvised explosive device which he detonated causing this atrocity.
We would ask people not to speculate on his details or to share names. There is a complex and wide ranging investigation underway.
Our priority is to work with the national Counter Terrorist Policing Network and UK intelligence services to establish more details about the individual who carried out this attack.” [Read the full statement here.]

Gabrielle Giffords Walking, Hopes To Climb A Mountain/n
By Radar Staff
Recovering Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is planning to “climb a mountain.”
Giffords’ husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, told the Arizona Republic on Sunday that his wife is slowly improving, as he sees progress “every few days.”
PHOTOS: Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords With Her Family 
Giffords’ doctors reported she’s walking a bit. Her speech is gradually progressing, as she’s up to giving one-word answers or short, declarative statements, the paper reported.
She’s primarily relying on her left side, though she’s regained some use of her right arm and leg (which were damaged after she was shot in the left side of her brain).
PHOTOS: Gabrielle Giffords With Her Husband & Friends
She’s expected to be present for the launch of her husband’s shuttle Endeavour on Friday afternoon in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
The Arizona Democrat, 40, was shot January 8 allegedly by Jared Loughner in a Tucson rampage that left six people dead.
The victims of the January 8 desert massacre were U.S. District Judge John Roll, 63; 9/11 baby Christina Taylor Green, 9; Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman, 30; Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. Thirteen others were injured.

 Bah Humbug! ‘World’s Worst Neighbor’ Threw Dog Feces, Ordered Contract Killing .../n
‘Tis not the season to be jolly for one ornery Eugene, Oregon, resident convicted of hatching a plan to have one of his neighbors killed.
According to police officials, Jeffrey Wright Leonard waged a battle against several terrified people who lived near his home. The 57-year-old man’s campaign of terror, which included aiming bright floodlights at his neighbors’ homes and hurling dog feces, came to a head when he allegedly tried to hire a hit man to off one of the people he considered his worst enemy.
Leonard is said to have offered to pay to have his neighbor’s vehicle rammed off the road and into a telephone pole. Incredibly, he hatched the sinister plan while in jail for violating a restraining order a different neighbor had taken out against him.
PHOTOS: Ice-T And His Adorable Pups
“We’re convinced this man meant business, and if our source was not going to agree to kill this guy, somebody else would,” Sgt. Scott McKee told the Eugene Register-Guard.
Police claim Leonard had gone as far as providing the contracted killer a license plate number for his target and arranging for him to use his Chevy Suburban in the crime.
Sgt. McKee noted that Leonard’s ruthless thirst for revenge was sparked over an “ongoing, long-standing dispute,” that could have started with a parking issue.

Unfortunately for neighbors, it wasn’t the first time Leonard — whose plan was foiled when the supposed hit man ratted him out — had caused havoc. Court record show he ended up in jail twice in 2014 after violating restraining orders.
In one case filed in November 2013, a neighbor petitioned the court for an order of protection after claiming Leonard attempted to “run me off the road while I was driving” and swore “that he was going to terrorize me till I moved.”
Forced to renew the restraining order several times over the next year, the neighbor revealed that Leonard’s campaign of harassment included throwing dog feces and shining a floodlight on his property.

Meanwhile, another neighbor was also forced to file a stalking protective order last spring against Leonard. “Being he has reached an unpredictable state, I fear that anything he says could and may happen,” she told the court, detailing how he would throw rocks, swear and use other tactics to make her and her family’s life a living hell. “I now have no idea of what he is capable of.”
Leonard, in turn, fired back by filing his own complaint against his accusers. “Unsafe, your honor, in my own home,” Leonard stated in legal documents. “I’m 100 percent disabled fighting bone cancer. Totally interfering with recovery. Stalking, watching, my nurses knowing their schedule.”
Leonard now faces charges of Solicitation for murder and conspiracy to commit murder. /n
 Truce! Dr. Paul Nassif Says He's Now Friends With Ex Adrienne Maloof After Nasty Divorce:.../n
It’s a Real Housewives of Beverly Hills miracle!
Nearly three years after their extremely nasty split, Dr. Paul Nassif and his ex-wife, former Bravo star Adrienne Maloof, 53, are no longer fighting, the Beverly Hills plastic surgeon tells RadarOnline.com in an exclusive video interview.
“One thing that Adrienne and I have done, since time does really take care of things, our relationship now, especially because we have three beautiful boys, is actually quite good,” the Botched star, 52, reveals. “I spoke to her three, four times today. Basic stuff, not even about our kids. Our relationship has definitely and greatly improved.”

Despite their newfound friendship, the couple won’t be reconciling, he says. After ending his relationship with girlfriend Chantelle de Jong, the single dad has his sights set on a very famous younger woman.
“If you know anyone who has Katy Perry’s number, Dr. Paul Nassif wants it,” the doctor’s Botched costar Dr. Terry Dubrow quips during the joint interview.
“I’m waiting to get a date,” Dr. Nassif confirms.

But unfortunately, the man Dr. Dubrow calls “the most eligible bachelor in L.A.” simply doesn’t have time to date these days.
“We’ve been filming for seven months. And we’re working 14-15 hours a day, I have my children, so any extra time I have, I’m trying to rest,” he explains. “So the dating scene has been put on the backburner.”

Racy Emails! Charles Payne's Affair With Alleged Sexual Harassment Victim, Exposed/n
Charles Payne and alleged sexual harassment victim Scottie Nell Hughes‘ racy emails have reportedly been found, RadarOnline.com can reveal, and the evidence tells all on the TV personalities’ three-year affair.
According to reports, the shocking emails come after Hughes accused Payne of having sexually harassed her and threatened her position at the company.
“You are going to need every once [sic] of energy if we are ever given the chance of lots of time and no commitments,” read one of Hughes’ alleged emails dated back to 2013.

In a email titled “Another sleepless night” she reportedly recounted a sexual dream she apparently had of the two, writing: “Do you know what I keep dreaming about.. You and I in the pool… My legs wrapped around your waste [sic] and you have me pressed up against the wall of the pool.”
Hughes continued: “Skin glistening and smelling of coconut… You thrusting yourself deeper inside with each push… And your fingers grasping each of my cheeks. Holding me to you.”
As Radar previously revealed, Fox Business suspended Payne due to Hughes’ sexual harassment accusations, while the Making Money host denied all claims.

While Payne has confirmed his three-year affair with Hughes, he denies that sexual assault was ever involved.
“I would like to extend an apology to my family and friends for having been involved in a romantic affair that ended two years ago,” he told Radar.
On Wednesday he tweeted: “Days ago a reporter contacted me about (false) allegations and asked for a comment. I gave an immediate reply. He reported story w/out them.”
PHOTOS: Fox News Bombshell: Gretchen Carlson RECORDED Roger Ailes’s Creepy Sex Come-Ons
He continued, saying that Hughes’ claim that he harassed her was “an ugly lie I vehemently deny to my core.”
“There is a mountain of proof that also proves it’s a lie.”
Firing back to his former lover’s career-wrecking accusations, Payne wrote: “I will fight this like a lion armed with truth. Thanks so much for all those that have reached out in support. #FightingBack”
PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan Makes ‘Jimmy Kimmel’ Appearance Amid Messy Lawsuit With ‘Fox News’ – Sports Odd Bruises
As Radar can report, both Hughes and Payne are currently married, yet their affair was well-known within the Fox News circles, as 10 sources confirmed.
The two reportedly shared a room while on a business trip to Las Vegas, where they disappeared together for “hours” during an event, said a source.
Hughes also attended Payne’s birthday party at his home in 2015, yet their flirty behavior made the Making Money host’s wife suspicious.
After the incident, Payne’s wife reportedly voiced her concerns to Fox’s former head of programming Bill Shine, after which he barred her from appearing on Fox News or Fox Business.
As Radar readers know, Hughes claimed she only stayed in the relationship with Payne because she thought it would help her career. She has now claimed he pressured her into staying with threats of reprisals.
Fox Business has renewed Payne’s contract, and Hughes has yet to comment on the leaked emails.

JoAnna Garcia Swisher Has an "Out of Body Experience" With Tyler Henry on Hollywood Medium: Watch the Emotional Clip! "I just am having an out of body experience. I can't believe…" JoAnna explains before breaking dow.../n
Things are going to get intense! JoAnna Garcia Swisher has a shocking reading with Tyler Henry on tonight's Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry. "There is a strong emphasis between this man and this woman, and they come through as a single unit," Tyler reveals in this sneak peek."Usually it means that these two people would have been so close in life that their relationship and the way that they would come through would be like one person," Tyler shares. "This is going to get emotional," JoAnna's husband Nick Swisher explains while watching in the other room. 

"I just am having an out of body experience. I can't believe…" JoAnna explains before breaking down in tears. "I want you to know that they're both coming through totally at ease and completely calm. That's usually people's priority, so please know that," Tyler reassures the actress. "Hector and Debbie. They were very close family friends, and their son is like my brother," JoAnna explains. "Really quickly, do you know who they were giving money to, because this is so weird," Tyler says to a shocked JoAnna.But before she can answer, he has lots more for the star. "Oh this is so frustrating. They would have been loaning or giving to some extent, like, money. The feeling is this person keeps taking and taking and taking, and they do not know when to stop taking this money," Tyler reveals. 

"I feel like there is just not a sense of full resolve with this person. It had to have been for so much more than just money," Tyler shares. "They're just bringing up this very toxic person. This person was very manipulative and knew exactly what to say and how to say it to get these things."   Catch the shocking reveal in the clip above!

Comedy trio, band, and BFFs The Lonely Island have a new half-hour comedy pilot — that’s just gotten the greenlight from Freeform — called Alone Together.

It will star Esther Povitsky (Lady Dynamite, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) and Benji Aflalo (Not Safe with Nikki Glaser), who will also be writing and executive producing the pilot. Eben Russell will also write and executive-produce.
Karey Burke, EVP Programming and Development at Freeform, noted: “This is a fiercely funny look at young adults who are unapologetically themselves while blazing their own paths, which fits nicely into the tradition already set by our current slate.”
Alone Together is Freeform’s second pilot order after Issues, a scripted series inspired by the life of Joanna Coles (editor of Cosmopolitan magazine). It also follows the renewal of Baby Daddy and new series’ Famous in Love, Marvel’s Cloak and Dagger, and Bachelor spinoff Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After. 
Lonely Island (aka Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer) released their first movie together, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, a mockumentary about a pop star, last month. They also executive produce Fox’s new Saturday night sketch-comedy series Party Over Here, launched in March.
Povitsky and Aflalo wrote, starred in, and self-produced the 20-minute short film “Alone Together” in 2015, available on Vimeo.

Jesse Eisenberg and Anna Strout Welcome First Child/n
Jesse Eisenberg is officially a dad!The Social Network star and his longtime girlfriend, Anna Strout, have welcomed their first child together, a baby boy.E! News has learned that the two were seen strolling through New York City earlier this morning with their little bundle of joy.The couple dated for 10 years, from 2002 to 2012, before taking a hiatus. They ultimately reunited before he traveled to London to perform in the West End show The Spoils. He spent four months volunteering at a domestic violence shelter in Bloomington, Indiana, where Strout's mother serves as executive director.They didn't make their official public debut until they were photographed at a basketball game that January, right after the New Year.

E! News exclusively broke the news that these two were expecting in October 2016. Eisenberg and Strout have kept their relationship incredibly private, but he has made it clear that she is the only woman for him.

"I find people who want to help other people to be the most interesting," he told Seventeen Magazine. "I come from a family of teachers, and my friends are teachers, often times in very difficult school situations. My job is so selfish and focused on my own vanity that I like to surround myself with people who are actually helping people throughout their day."

Our brother Robert, who became our brother Alexis, who became our sister Alexis, who became our brother Alexis, passed this morning September 11, at 12:32 am. He was surrounded by all of his brothers and sisters, one of his nieces and several other loved ones. We were playing music for him and he passed during David Bowie’s ‘Starman.’ As per his wishes, we cheered at the moment that he transitioned to another dimension. I am feeling immense gratitude to have been afforded the luxury of sharing life with him/her, for learning from Alexis, for being given the gift of being able to love him/her and to be loved by him/her. He was a force. He died as he lived, on his own terms. I am immensely grateful that it was fast and painless. It was an incredibly moving experience and I am humbled and grateful to have been able to have been with him as he began his journey onward. Thank you, Alexis, I love you and will love you always.
Alexis, who is part of the acting Arquette clan that includes sisters Rosanna and Patricia and brother David, started acting at age 12, and along with The Wedding Singer, Alexis also appeared in Bride of Chucky and Pulp Fiction. His most recent role was in Adam Sandler’s Blended.

Stonewall Director and Star Defend Film Against Critics Who Claim It 'Whitewashed' LGBT History/n
The Stonewall riots that occurred in Greenwich Village in 1969 have emerged as a watershed moment in the history of LGBT rights. But a new movie that examines the origins of the historic moment is coming under fire for allegedly “whitewashing” events that critics say took a far more diverse group of people than depicted in the film.  
In a controversial new interview, Stonewall director Roland Emmerich defends the film, explaining that his decision to have the film center around a young, white fictional male character seemed to be the best way to attract straight people to the story – and educate them about the event.  
“You have to understand one thing: I didn’t make this movie only for gay people, I made it also for straight people,” Emmerich, who previously helmed blockbusters like Independence Day and White House Down, told Buzzfeed. “I kind of found out, in the testing process, that actually, for straight people, [Danny] is a very easy in. Danny’s very straight-acting. He gets mistreated because of that. [Straight audiences] can feel for him.”  
Emmerich, who is openly gay and said he chose to make the film in part after volunteering at a Los Angeles LGBT center, also admitted he approached the film from his own perspective.  
“As a director you have to put yourself in your movies, and I’m white and gay,” he said.  
The film centers around a character named Danny (Jeremy Irvine) who travels to New York City from Indiana, where he was ostracized by his family after getting caught fooling around with the high school football quarterback. Once in NYC, he is embraced by a non-white group of gender-queer street kids who spur him into action, eventually inspiring him to hurl the first brick to kick off the riots.  

The fictional retelling has angered certain members of LGBT community, who give special credit to transgender and lesbian women of color for their role in the origins of the historic riots.  
In a recent interview with Autostraddle, Miss Major Griffin-Gracie, a black trans woman present at the time of the riots, said “I’m sorry, but the last time I checked, the only gay people I saw hanging around there were across the street cheering. They were not the ones getting slugged or having stones thrown at them. It’s just aggravating. And hurtful! For all the girls who are no longer here who can’t say anything, this movie just acts like they didn’t exist.”  
Emmerich told Buzzfeed he and screenwriter Jon Robin Baitz consulted with historians and veterans who determined “there were only a couple of transgender women in the Stonewall ever. They were like a minority.” Buzzfeed reports only one character in the film, real-life black trans leader Marsha P. Johnson (Otoja Abit), emerges as a discernible trans character.  
A petition started by trans woman Pat Cordova-Goff to boycott the film has received nearly 25,000 signatures, referring to it as the “newest whitewashed version of queer history.”  
Meanwhile, the star at the center of the controversy – Jeremy Irvine – says he’s sensitive to the issues surrounding the film, and just hopes the controversy only gets people talking about LGBT and diversity issues even more.  
“No minority has been treated worse that the black transgender community so I totally understand that. But it’s nice for the movie to come out and say, ‘Look.’ This is a movie we’re all genuinely really proud of,” he told The Daily Beast, after writing on social media that he “deeply honors” the diverse Stonewall activists.   
The British-born Irvine, 25, also says he’s aware this was a very personal project for Emmerich and writer Jon Robin Baitz: “I think that’s why my character’s in there. I think parts of them both are in my character. So it’s kind of like we’re seeing it through his eyes.”  
And with the controversy in full swing, he’s learning to navigate his unofficial role as advocate for the film, the gay rights movement and more.  
“I find it difficult to see it as my place,” he admitted. “I do get a little bit of stick from people who are like, ‘Who are you to say these things?’ You kind of have to agree with people on that. But at the same time I think everyone can stand up for equality.”  
Stonewall opens in theaters Friday.

Wynonna Judd's Secret Shame — Daughter BUSTED & JAILED For Cooking Meth/n
Country singer Wynonna Judd has been hiding a major secret from fans: Her wild child daughter, Grace Pauline Kelley, has been in and out of court for more than a year after she was BUSTED for meth!
According to court documents obtained by RadarOnline.com, Kelley – Judd’s 21-year-old daughter with ex Arch Kelley – was arrested on December 18, 2015, at a Nashville Walgreen’s store, when cops caught her acting very suspiciously.
“Detectives noticed the vehicle was sitting at the location for an extended period of time,” Kelley’s arrest affidavit states. She “was observed exiting the vehicle and entering the store.”
Cops pulled her over because her license plate “was improperly secured” and “held on by one screw.”
While they were chatting her up “a concerned citizen handed detectives a plastic bag that was thrown from the passenger side” of Kelley’s car in the parking lot.
PHOTOS: The Judd Family Through The Years
“Inside the bag was a torn up box of pseudoephedrine, and a receipt showing a purchase of Coleman fuel,” the documents claim. Security camera footage proved that Kelley had made the purchase, and that someone had then thrown the bag from her car.
According to the affidavit, “these items are the precursors for the manufacturing of methamphetamine.” Cops searched a national database and found that Grace had been banned from purchasing pseudoephedrine because her “purchase history” was “consistent with someone who is manufacturing methamphetamine.”
Kelley was arrested and charged with promotion of meth manufacture, a felony.
In May 2016, she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of possession of meth, a misdemeanor.

But the trouble didn’t end there. She was arrested in Alabama on November 13, 2016, for being a “fugitive from justice,” and her probation was revoked on November 29, 2016. Her case was transferred to drug court for 18 months.
Then on February 20, she was arrested AGAIN for trying to flee the law in Tennessee, and shipped back to the state, where she was officially arrested on March 1, and charged with evading arrest, unlawful drug paraphernalia and two counts of simple possession. She’s currently still in custody. 
As Radar has reported, Kelley has been a problem child for years. In 2011, she disappeared for several days during a flight layover while returning from boarding school. In December 2012, Wynonna sent the teen to a “behavioral camp” for six months, according to a source. Grace petitioned a court to give custody of her to aunt
Grace petitioned a court to give custody of her to aunt Ashley Judd, claiming her mom was a pill-popping, abusive nightmare. Wynonna denied those allegations, but Ashley got temporary custody and Kelley moved into her Tennessee home in 2014.
Kelley’s attorney did not respond to Radar’s request for comment.

Patton Oswalt & Meredith Salenger Get ENGAGED A Month After Making Their Red Carpet Debut As A Couple!/n

The King of Queens alum and the 47-year-old only went public with their relationship last month when they hit the red carpet at the El Lay premiere for Baby Driver. Still, the twosome haven't been shy about flaunting their love on social media, as they've posted several pics together on Instagram and Twitter.
In fact, it appears as though this relationship has had a positive impact on the both of them. Nonetheless, it's believed that the duo have only been dating for a few months. According to a source via People, Oswalt and Salenger's romance came about thanks to their mutual friend Martha Plimpton.
The insider dished:
"They met through mutual friend Martha Plimpton. They started chatting as friends and it blossomed from there."
We hope Patton's eight-year-old daughter, Alice Rigney, is just as excited as the couple.
Anywho, Meredith even teased her engagement news as she took to IG TWICE this week and posted:

Taylor Swift's Beverly Hills Mansion A Historic Landmark, But Hold The Nail & Hammer /nTaylor Swift's Beverly Hills home just got officially designated as a historic landmark, which means she'll be getting a HUGE tax break, but it comes with one big disadvantage ... she can't alter a thing without jumping through hoops. Taylor will need to get approval from the Beverly Hills Historic Preservation Committee if she wants to build a recording studio on the property ... or anything else for that matter. A rep for the committee tells us it's a complicated process to get the green light for remodeling projects. Taylor purchased the Samuel L. Goldwyn estate back in 2015 for $25 mil. It was built in 1934 and housed 2 generations of the Goldwyn family before it finally went on the market. We're told the property's architecture was the driving force in making it landmark worthy, and any remodeling will be super tricky. There are various criteria for a house to qualify as a Bev Hills landmark, including architecture, and whether a significant person lived there./n

Kim's Secret Strip Tease! Kardashian's Hot Home Movie Leaks/n
“Take it off!” Kim Kardashian was a sexed up girl gone wild during a steamy strip tease on her 23rd birthday trip !
As Radar reported, Kardashian and then-boyfriend Ray J traveled to Cabo San Lucas in October 2003, and their infamous sex tape wasn’t the only thing they put on film.
The never-before-seen home videos show Kardashian as you’ve never seen her before – including one section where she laps up a sexy striptease by her boyfriend.
PHOTOS: So Much Back Fat! Kim Kardashian’s Rolls Emerge From Her Skirt In L.A. In 8 New Photos
Performing in a contest at a local bar, Ray gets down to the Prince song “Kiss” as Kardashian screams in the audience.
Grinding and stripping down for a random woman, Ray is totally focused on his performance while Kardashian screams, “Take it off!”
They also teamed up for a hot show of their own. In a couple’s dance, Ray happily grabs Kardashians boobs in front of the entire audience. In turn, raunchy Kardashian grabs his genitals as the host yells, “Come on girls, go for the jewels!”

They continue feverishly making out as the host laughs, “You will never be able to run for Senator!”
The couple would break up three years later, and just a few months after the split their infamous sex tape with Vivid video was released, shooting them both to stardom.

Harry Styles is in mourning.

The “Sign of the Times” singer’s stepfather, Robin Twist, died this week after battling cancer. He was 57.
“Harry’s stepfather, Robin Twist, sadly passed away this week after a long battle with cancer,” Harry’s rep said in a statement. “The family asks for privacy at this time.”



A post shared by Anne (@annetwist) on Jun 2, 2017 at 2:18pm PDT



Robin had been a huge part Harry’s life since the star was 7, supporting him during his teenage years and The X Factor auditions. He married Harry’s mother, Anne Cox, at a private ceremony in Congleton, Cheshire in June 2013. The One Directioner crooner served as best man at the wedding.
Robin had helped raised Harry since he was 7 after Cox’s split with the star’s biological father, Des Styles. He was also the stepdad to Harry’s sister, Gemma, as well as the father of son Mike and daughter Amy from a previous relationship.

Time to say farewell to Matthew Crawley.

 Perhaps Walter White should make a stop by Downton when Breaking Bad wraps for good this year.
On Saturday, Downton Abbey cast members Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Hughes), Sophie McShera (Daisy), Amy Nuttal (Ethel) and Allen Leech (Tom Branson) hit the red carpet at the 2013 Screen Actors Guild Awards, and found themselves in awe of the star-studded spectacle.
“Trying to be cool and not look star-struck is so hard,” Nuttal told Celebuzz, noting that she was excited to see Breaking Bad stars Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston.
“Jennifer Garner, I have a huge crush on her. Huge. She’s amazing.”
“Some of the Mad Men [too],” added McShera.

Leech, who let the ladies do most of the talking, made fun of his own silence on Sunday.

“You have to wear a dress to have a comment. Unfortunately, I left mine at home . . . I’m only kidding.”
What Leech did dish on was the upcoming Matthew Crawley-less season four. (Dan Stevens announced his exit late last year).
“We start back on the 11th of February. We read the first two scripts . . . very exciting,” said Leech.

EXCLUSIVE! Heather Morris: Maksim Chmerkovskiy Was "So Manly and Humble" During Dancing With the Stars Injury/n
Heather Morris has a new partner on Dancing With the Stars. The Glee veteran, who danced with Maksim Chmerkovskiy during week one of the competition, did her jive with Alan Bersten during week two after a rehearsal injury sidelined Maks. The couple received a 30 out of 40 for their dance to Little Mix's "Grown.""He was very worried about me all night," Heather told E! News about Alan. "I was like, ‘No, no, no,' this is about you and I both.""The most important thing though is Heather gets comfortable and Maks gets better soon," Alan told us. "It's not easy for her to transfer to a different partner at the last minute."

Maks injured his calf during rehearsal for Dancing With the Stars week two and was unable to compete with Heather. In the video above, Heather recounts the shocking moment that took place preparing for the second week of competition."It seemed like something that was so small," Heather said. "And my reaction, obviously wasn't huge because it was like, ‘Oh, what happened? It just felt like something popped?' And he couldn't really walk.""I think something went down," Maks said at rehearsal while hopping on one foot. "It's my calf muscle. F—k. It just felt like something hit it…I can't stand on it. This is not good."

Heather said Maks was "so manly and humble" throughout the whole ordeal, which you can see in the video above. "He was like, ‘No, I'm fine.' And was just trying to figure it out by himself," Heather said.There's no question if Maks will return, it's a matter of when. His fiancée and DWTS competition Peta Murgatroyd told us he was heading to Ohio for rehab help.

Dancing With the Stars airs Mondays, 8 p.m. on ABC. Be sure to watch E! News at 7 and 11 p.m. for more Dancing With the Stars scoop.

Happy birthday, Hayden Joel!
May 24 marked the 1st birthday of General Hospital and The Bold and the Beautiful actress Ashley Jones and husband Joel Henricks‘ son, who partied alongside his parents and 5-year-old big brother Huck (Henricks’ son from a previous relationship).
The family of four celebrated with a jungle-themed “Wild One” soirée on Sunday, June 11, hosted by Good Carma Studio at Adams Garden indoor play space in Sherman Oaks, California.
“We wanted an environment where kids of all ages could safely run around and play and the adults could still visit,” Jones, 40, tells PEOPLE. “We picked a bright, cheery indoor playground.”

The event was catered by STONEFIRE Grill, who served up barbecue chicken, tri-tip steak, arugula corn roasted salad, breadsticks and pesto pasta salad, along with chicken tenders and mac ‘n’ cheese for the kids to nosh on amid wild-animal themed table centerpieces by The Bashful Rose.
“My friends GoodCarmaGirls decked out the place with the most adorable animal-themed details from the table setting to the dessert spread,” says Jones. “It was truly perfect.”
Aside from the main meal, attendees snacked on animal and Goldfish crackers from nesting bowls provided by Stephen Joseph Gifts, sipping on assorted-flavored drinks from a LaCroix sparkling-water bar.

The birthday boy, outfitted in an adorable festive black and gold shirt by Fayfaire, received his very own cake from Polkatots Cupcakes — whose creatively crafted dessert table also featured multiple wild-animal-themed confections, chocolate-covered pretzels and rainbow-sprinkled Rice Krispies Treats.
Guests like Jones’ fellow television stars Ali Fedotowsky-Manno, Amy Davidson and Kimberly Brown brought their own little ones to help ring in Hayden’s first year by jumping in balls pits, climbing on the jungle gym and participating in a variety of indoor games, including a mommy-and-me parachute game.
“It meant a great deal to us to have friends and family celebrating Hayden’s first birthday,” the actress says. “It was the sweetest, cutest day. Hayden even seemed to grasp that people were singing to him. He looked so proud!”



Leah Ingersoll
Of course, no one left the festivities empty-handed! Guests took home favor bags, personalized with Mabel’s Labels jungle-themed tags and filled to the brim with Stephen Joseph water bottles and lunch box sets, jungle stuffed animals and bubble wands.
“I’m grateful we have this memory. The day was full of joy,” the PEOPLE blogger and proud mama says. “Hayden’s brother, Huck, said it best on the way home: ‘I didn’t want the party to end. I wanted it to last forever.’ ”

Mean Girls is the movie that keeps on giving. If you celebrate October 3, can quote every line, and are still saving up for two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus, you're living your best life. Oh, and the actor who played the beloved Glen Coco totally approves of your obsession. David Reale, despite moving on from Mean Girls with tons of other roles, says he's still all about the love and attention Glen Coco has brought him. According to Daily Mail, David got the part of Glen almost by accident. He was hanging around the set after not getting the original role he auditioned for and was asked to play Glen Coco instead. Honestly, best decision of his life, right?Even though we only see the back of his head, everybody knows Glen Coco is just as iconic as Cady, Regina, Aaron and the gang. In fact, he might even be more iconic since we know so little about him. Hmm...could there be a Glen Coco spin-off? That probably would have been a lot better than most people's opinions of Mean Girls 2. Just saying.

 Breast Milk Is Best! Gisele Shares Pic Where She’s Feeding Her 1-Year-Old Baby Naturally.../n
Gisele Bundchen is such a fervent supporter of breast feeding that she once said it should be the law and she proved that she does it herself by posting a picture where she is nursing her young daughter Vivian Brady.
Tom Brady’s supermodel wife posted the picture while she gets her hair and makeup done.
where she’s wearing only a white robe pulled to the side so her baby could breast feed and wrote: “What would I do without this beauty squad after the 15 hours flying and only 3 hours of sleep #multitasking #gettingready”

Gisele enraged mothers around the world with her statement about how children should be fed, saying: “I think there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months.”
She showed off that she is more than good for her word, with Vivian, who celebrated her first birthday on December 5, sweetly holding onto a gold necklace around her mommy’s neck while she calmly feeds. /n

As waters rose in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey, TV reporter Brandi Smith and her cameraman were reporting in the field when fellow employees back at KHOU 11 News headquarters evacuated to escape a flood on Sunday. The pair became the only team left on-air, but despite the challenging circumstances still came to the rescue of a stranded truck driver whose cab was nearly covered by water.
“The lights are going on this truck and the windshield wipers are going, and as we get a little closer it does look like there is someone inside,” Smith said in a video report showing the tractor-trailer stuck on flooded Beltway 8 in North Houston. “There is movement inside of this truck!”
According to reports, Hurricane Harvey has caused five deaths and 12 injuries across Texas and Louisiana since it made landfall on Friday. Almost 13 million people are under a flood watch and many have had to abandon vehicles to escape the dangerous waters.
When Smith noticed a man sitting in the cab of the truck, she urged him to resist climbing from the window of his 18-wheeler into the 10-foot-high water that continued to rise.
“Can you get to the top of your vehicle? Can you get to the top of your truck? Do not climb into the water!” Smith yelled.
Smith then noticed a passing Harris County Sheriff’s Office truck towing a boat. When she flagged down the deputies, they told her they were on their way to another rescue and had no idea there was a stranded truck driver below.

One of the officials told Smith that the man was in the same location where another driver had died during floods in April 2016.
“We had to dive for him because he passed away and went underwater,” the deputy said.
The officials quickly went to work, lowering their boat into the water in a matter of minutes.
“Sir, they’re putting the boat in just now! They are on their way!” Smith yelled to the driver.
The deputies placed a life preserver over the man after pulling him from the passenger-side window and into the boat. Viewers watching KHOU weren’t able to see the rescue as Smith had already been knocked off the air due to the evacuations.

“I cannot imagine how terrifying it would be to be in that place right now. Put yourself in that place: your car is filling with water. Help is on the way, he is incredibly lucky,” Smith told viewers in a video she later posted to Facebook.

The truck driver, named Robert, greeted Smith when he made it to higher ground.
“I just thank God that you guys were right here to get me and put me back on land safely,” Robert told Smith. “I appreciate you.”

Princess Diana's Secret Long-Lost 'Daughter!'/n
Few outside the royal family mourn the death of Princess Diana as much as the tiny tot the royal beauty referred to as “my daughter.”
In 1992, 4-year-old Avanti Reddy delighted Diana, who was then touring India with her husband, Prince Charles. Dressed in traditional garb — her face painted and her feet bare — little Avanti danced for Diana, then climbed onto her lap.
The image became a beloved shot, but it was more than a photo op for the princess. She was truly charmed by the child, and so the two continued to correspond by mail. Then, five years after their initial meeting, Avanti hoped to have a reunion with her.
PHOTOS: What Happened To The Men Who Stole Princess Diana’s Heart?
But tragedy struck. Diana was killed in a Paris car crash mere days before they could meet again. Avanti, a 28-year-old school teacher, has never forgotten the magical moment she shared with the People’s Princess.
“I was the youngest one there,” Avanti recalls of that February day in Hyderabad. “Diana saw me sitting on the ground, picked me up, took me back to stage and put me on her knee.”
The pair had a touching conversation, with Diana asking all about Avanti. “I had a cold, so she wiped my nose with her own handkerchief,” Avanti remembers. “She kept me with her the whole time, and then, as she was going, said, ‘I don’t want to leave you. I don’t have a daughter, so today you are my daughter.'”
PHOTOS: Your Mom’s Fave Royal: Princess Diana in Pictures
Avanti was thrilled at the thought of seeing the princess a second time. “We were performing in a number of schools [in Europe] and at the end of the trip we were going to see her again,” she says. “But it never happened.”
Diana’s grace and goodness stuck with Avanti always. “When I got older, I started to realize more about who Princess Diana was,” she explains.
Now, Avanti dreams of performing for the current generation of royals — or perhaps their children. Wistfully she says, “Maybe one day I could organize a dance for Prince George and Princess Charlotte!”

Unlike Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal, whose onscreen bromance became the ultimate #FriendshipGoals, Charlie Hunnam got an icy welcome from co-star Robert Pattinson when he first arrived on set.

According to the Sons of Anarchy alum, he barely spoke to the former Twilight star when they worked together on their upcoming movie, The Lost City of Z.
“I had a couple of rehearsal sessions with Sienna [Miller], but I didn’t spend any time with Tom [Holland] or Robert,” he told Screen Daily while promoting the film at the Berlin Film Festival. “I wanted these relationships to evolve naturally on screen, through the work. I don’t think I said more than ten words to Robert off camera.”
“I didn’t know if he was just ‘in that zone’ or if he genuinely didn’t like me,” the 36-year-old continued. “There was a real distance between us.”

Though the two do share screen time, Hunnam added Pattinson only started initiating contact when production had wrapped. “He’s reached out to me subsequently, making overtures for us to be friends now,” he shared, “so I think it was about the work.”
However, it wasn’t all Pattinson’s fault. Hunnam also admitted to isolating himself in order to get into character for the film, which centers around a group of 1920s explorers who get lost in the Amazon.
“I wanted to be away from everybody, in a scaled back version of living as much as possible. They found this tiny hotel for me that was basically like little huts in the jungle where I could be by myself,” he recalled. “I was so engaged in this process of no emails, no phone — I didn’t speak to the rest of the outside world during the duration of the shooting. When we started shooting the explorations, the others wanted to stay in my hotel, but I couldn’t break the [silent] spell. I just avoided them in the lunch room.”
Based on the 2009 book of the same name, The Lost City of Z is due out in theaters April 14.

 Shannon Throws Plate At Kelly In Explosive ‘RHOC’ Battle: ‘Get The F**k Away From.../n
Shannon Beador and Lydia McLaughlin‘s explosive fight marked the opening of the Real Housewives of Orange County, and a chaos of flying plates and middle fingers against Kelly Dodd marked the end of episode three, RadarOnline.com can reveal.
A birthday bash for Tamra Judge‘s granddaughter’s was the opening scene, with Beador and McLaughlin bickering, as if no time had passed from the last episode. “I will never be like Vicki Gunvalson,” Beador vows in the scene, speaking of her arch enemy.
“I’m f**king done. I don’t want to hang out with somebody like that,” she says during her tantrum in the limo.
“F**k you guys,” she yells after storming away.
PHOTOS: Tamra Barney Judge: 14 Secrets Scandals
Beador rips McLauglin trying to make peace with Gunvalson, saying: “I wasn’t screaming at Lydia McLaughlin. I wasn’t judging at Lydia McLaughlin. Yet she did that to me. To the point where she assumes, I’m not going to get along with you. Way to make new friends.”
But McLaughlin doesn’t care: “Shannon, mayor of crazy town, party of one,” she says about Beador.
That altercation set up the biggest fight of the season so far, which happened in the last 10 minutes of the show.
In a scene, Peggy Sulahain‘s struggle to go “through the process of reconstructive surgery,” after her double mastectomy was featured, with her devoted husband gushing about his love for her.

“She’s the sexiest woman. With or without breasts she’s my soul mate,” Diko says.
Vicki Gunvalson is the reason all of the women are fighting but she’s only in one scene and one flashback in the episode. She’s moving into her new office, but discusses the difficulties she has with relationships.
“I’ve been burned too many times by trusting people: Brooks, Tamra. I’ve been too giving and too trusting in my past relationships. But that isn’t going to happen again.”
Megan Edmonds makes one brief appearance as well, with her husband Jim.

“Do I wish my husband was around more? Yes. It’s not fun to be a single mom when jimmy travels for work.”
As the new parents are cuddling their baby Aspen, Megan makes the most entertaining statement of the show. “Babies can see ghosts. They’ve just come from the spirit world,” she says about her little daughter.
Beador’s meeting with her doctor/trainer is devastating. She goes to the gym and finds out her weight is up to 172.2 with 40 percent body fat – she is crushed.
“How are you?” asks the Doctor. “Large,” she replies.

In tears, Beador struggles to justify her weight gain: “I just don’t understand how I let myself go.
When I look at myself in the mirror I don’t like who I am. People say you have too many fillers, no it’s f**king called weight gain.”
She admits that her now heavy frame is destroying her marriage. “I do not feel sexy. It is affecting my intimacy because I’m embarrassed.”
An explosive dinner ends the episode. Beador and Kelly Dodd are the stars of the show.

McLaughlin, Sulahain and Judge all listen as Beador confesses the truth about her weight gain and the allegation that her husband “beat the sh*t,” out of her.
Judge is judgy about her friend’s food and beverage choices as she struggles with her weight.
“How does Shannon expect to lose weight when she’s drinking alcohol and eating red meat?” she says.
But the night falls apart when Kelly Dodd walks into the restaurant which McLaughlin told her about the previous night.

Beador and Dodd amicably chat in the bathroom, but the conversation takes a sour turn.
“I love to push Shannon’s buttons,” Dodd admits, and while McLaughlin prays over Beador in the bathroom, Dodd crashes their table.
Beador says to Dodd, “I was surprised to see you here. The last time I saw you wasn’t the most pleasant experience,” she says, recalling the reunion where Dodd called her “mean.”
Unable to stand her presence at the table, Beador lashes out, ordering Dodd to leave the table. “You have been nothing but a disgusting person to me. Move along. Walk off the table right now.”

As their bickering continues, Dodd snipes “Maybe you need some hormones or something for your body,” which sets Beador off.
“F**k you. F**k you,” she screams. “Read between these lines you f**king bitch,” she says while giving her the middle finger. “Get out of my table!”
A cruel Dodd then taunts her. “Keep eating. Keep eating,” she says.
“This isn’t my plate you stupid f**king bitch. That’s not my f**king plate,” she says and throws the plate across the table at Dodd.

Bella Hadid Was Sewn Into the Sexy, Semi-Sheer Alexander Wang Jumpsuit She Wore to the Met Gala

Bella Hadid made her third Met Gala appearance on Monday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in N.Y.C. wearing a super sheer Catwoman-like crocheted off-the-shoulder bodysuit by Alexander Wang, whom she brought as her date, and Bulgari jewelry. From behind, the skin-tight jumpsuit featured a deep, sexy scooped back. The star also wore her hair in a brand-new sleek and short shoulder-grazing bob cut that morning by Danielle Ward, according to fellow hair stylist Jen Atkin’s Instagram.

Hadid also confirmed her bob was indeed a real haircut, and not just a wig like fellow Met Gala attendee Kylie Jenner wore. “When @inezandvinoodh, @gb65, @ward_hair ask you to cut your hair for your new @vogueitalia cover …the answer is yes! And not better carpet to show it off than the MET! Thank you for an amazing night Anna @voguemagazine and of course my amazing date @alexanderwangny,” Hadid captioned a shot of her new hair on Instagram.

The model’s skin-tight jumpsuit wasn’t a walk in the park to get into — Hadid told reporters on the carpet, “I’m sewn in!” On top of it, she wore her pointed-toe heels inside her tight-like jumpsuit, an impressive feat to pull off her most daring Met Gala outfit to-date!
This year, the 20-year-old model went without a boyfriend to the glamorous fashion event, after breaking off her romance with The Weeknd in November. (The Weeknd is now dating fellow singer Selena Gomez and attended the Met Gala with her on Monday.)

Hadid and The Weeknd haven’t crossed paths many times since their relationship ended, and the model reportedly felt “hurt and pissed” her ex rebounded so quickly with Gomez.

Hadid’s look tonight didn’t venture off from her usual black outfits she’s worn the past two years to the Met Gala. For last year’s Manus x Machina theme, the model and The Weeknd went for a matchy-matchy couple’s look, both wearing all-black ensembles by Givenchy for the occasion.

In 2015, Hadid made her debut at the fashionable event (side-by-side with big sis Gigi, of course) right as she was on the cusp of making it big in the modeling world. But unlike other stars, who go all out in über-expensive, custom-made gowns for the Met Gala, Hadid and other rising models at the time, like Emily Ratajkowski, Hailey Baldwin and Joséphine de La Baume, wore affordable off-the-rack dresses courtesy of Topshop.

The Pretty Little Liars Plot Twist Was Right In Front Of Our Eyes This Entire Time…/n

If you're like MANY stans, you've spent YEARS religiously watching Pretty Little Liars to find out who in the world A, and then later AD, was — and it looks like the answer might've been right in front of us the entire time!
If you haven't seen this week's series finale and/or care about spoilers, you're gonna wanna go ahead and stop reading.
Related: The Most Gruesome Deaths From PLL!
But for all of our little liars out there, you already know AD was revealed to be Spencer Hasting's evil twin/Mary Drake's daughter, Alex Drake, also played by Troian Bellisario. Shoooook.
Turns out, the 31-year-old actress, who has kept the big secret since season five, has been giving us a major hint on her Twitter page (below) right under our noses! 

As you can see, her bio reads:
"Actor. Writer. Poet. Dancer. Rock and Roll Jesus. (sometimes I play this chick Spencer Hastings on this show Pretty Little Liars). But only sometimes."

 Stealing, Fighting, Drug Dealing & Crashing Cars: ‘Catfish’ Star Nev Schulman’s.../n
On his hit show Catfish, Nev Schulman exposes the real lives of people in online relationships.
But RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that the “good guy” host has hidden his own shocking secret: a past life as stealing, car-crashing drug dealer who was tossed out of high school.
In his upcoming book, In Real Life: Love, Lives & Identity in the Digital Age, Schulman, 29, comes clean about his “long and illustrious career as a juvenile delinquent.”
PHOTOS: 12 Stars Who Sobered Up In Hollywood
As a freshman, the teen was suspended from high school for waving condoms around in class, but ultimately kicked out for swiping a WiFi card from his computer teacher’s desk.
“My real problem was stealing,” he admits in the new part-memoir, part-advice book. “I stole DVDs from Tower Records, clothing from Ralph Lauren, and a host of other miscellaneous items.”
But the angst-ridden teen didn’t learn his lesson then. When Schulman began his college years at Sarah Lawrence in New York, his behavior took a dangerous turn.
PHOTOS: Stars Who Have Been To Rehab
“There were car crashes,” he writes. “I wrecked a 1980 Porche (fell asleep at the wheel), a Harley-Davidson (going too fast on vacation) and a 1992 Acura Legend…It’s probably a miracle I’m still alive.”
The New York native also broke into a restaurant and stole all the liquor, and began selling drugs, including marijuana and mushrooms.
In a disgusting stunt, Schulman says he broke into his school cafeteria and “took a dump in the cereal dispenser,” which shut down the kitchen for two days.

“I was on the outs with everyone,” he confesses. “I disappointed my family; I infuriated authorities; I pissed off half the kids at my school.”
After getting arrested during a fight at a party, the budding photographer was thrown out of college his junior year.
Schulman says he was ultimately a victim to a “catfish”— a person who creates a fake online identity— because he felt unfulfilled.
PHOTOS: Heroin Addicts, Coke Fiends & Celebrity Stoners — Hollywood Drug Dealers Tell All!
“I wanted attention. A sense of value. I wanted to be needed,” he explains. “I’d go to parties, take pictures, get laid. It was surface. I was ‘lite’”
He began an eight-month online courtship with 19-year-old ballet dancer named Megan, who wound up actually being a middle-aged woman in Michigan.
His heartbreak led to his 2010 independent film about the ordeal, Catfish, and eventually the wildly popular TV show.
Now a law-abiding citizen at 29, Schulman says he tries to be “kind and respectful and humble and pleasant” with everyone he comes across. /n
VIDEO: Cameras Capture Smiling & Singing Miners Trapped 2,000 Feet Underground/n
For the first time, we are seeing video of those 33 miners – trapped for nearly two weeks 2,200 feet underground in Chile, and RadarOnline.com can show it to you.
Watch the video on RadarOnline.com
The footage is shocking – not because it shows death and destruction, but because it shows the men in surprisingly good spirits and even singing.
The images were recorded Thursday by a small video camera lowered into the mine thru a bore hole.

In the video, we see the men smiling and sending greetings to their families. The men also joke with one another and belt out the national anthem.
“We are super and extremely happy,” one of the miners said in Spanish. “And we are sure that with smart people and technology, they will soon get us out.”

A Non-Profit Is Raising Funds to Move Edith Macefield's Up House to a New Home/n
Just like the Academy Award-winning movie Up, the tumultuous history of Edith Macefield’s house appears to have found its happy ending after all.  
OPAL (Of People and Land) Community Land Trust, a nonprofit organization, is raising money to save the home from destruction by moving it from its nook in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood to Orcas Island in Washington’s San Juan Islands.  
In 2006, Macefield, who passed away in 2008, rejected an offer of $1 million when commercial developers wanted to plow down her Seattle property. After Up premiered in 2009, viewers drew obvious parallels between the sweetly stubborn Macefield and the film’s lovably crotchety protagonist Carl. Disney took notice as well, tying balloons to Macefield’s house Up-style while promoting the film.  
But the story turned sour when the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported in June that the 115-year-old farmhouse had gone into foreclosure and would be torn down in 90 days if it were not sold.  
The idea that Macefield’s house might be demolished went over like a lead balloon among the public.  
A mother-daughter duo made a bid to purchase the house and convert it into a pie shop, but city regulations made the proposal too expensive.  
But then the happy ending seemingly arrived. Beating out several other interested buyers, OPAL, an organization which provides inexpensive housing for low-income residents of Orcas Island, swooped in before the 90-day deadline.  
Within the next 60 to 90 days, OPAL plans to transport the house via truck and carry it across the water via barge. Once the structure has reached Orcas Island, OPAL will put the house back on a truck for a two-mile journey to its new locale. To speed up the final leg of the trip, OPAL will temporarily shut down the island’s Eastsound Airport and use the runway as a faster route. OPAL has relocated 10 homes in the past.  
“I can’t tell you how excited OPAL is about saving this house and having a family live in it,” states Jeanne Beck, OPAL’s Stewardship and Project Manager, in a press release on Wednesday.  From the first time I saw Edith’s house, I wanted to save it   and now we can.”  
Real estate broker Paul Thomas adds that Macefield’s home will have more breathing room in its new spot. “It will be surrounded by trees, not by towering cement walls. Rather than being forlorn and vacant it will be lived in and loved,” he says.  
Using Kickstarter as a platform, OPAL is trying to raise $205,000 by Sept. 15 to move the house, refurbish it for its future inhabitants, and buy the land on which the house will rest.  
“The house really will float away, but not by air,” Thomas notes in a July 30 press release. “I can’t possibly imagine a more wonderful ending for this chapter of the Edith Macefield story.”

Witnesses Reveal Horrifying Uber Rides With Kalamazoo Shooter/n
Between Jason Brian Dalton‘s terrifying killing sprees this weekend, the Uber driver was actually taking customers for rides.
As Radar previously reported, the 45-year-old is now in police custody after allegedly killing six people in an hours-long shooting rampage in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The shooting spree began around 6pm Saturday evening when a woman — who was with her three children — was shot four times in the parking lot of an apartment complex. While she is expected to survive, others were not so lucky.

Four hours later, two men were shot and killed at a Kia dealership. Ten minutes later, the shooter opened fire at a Cracker Barrel restaurant, slaying four women and seriously injuring a 14-year-old girl. Dalton was arrested two hours later.
Police and witnesses have also revealed that Dalton was accepting fares between killing sprees.
According to Fox17, around midnight, an Indiana native visiting Kalamazoo with his wife called for an Uber, despite reports of multiple shootings.
“I halfheartedly joked at him and said ‘You are not the shooter are you?’,” the husband said, “and he said ‘no’, and I said ‘are you sure’, and he said ‘no, I’m just really tired.'”

Other customers of Dalton, who weren’t aware of the shootings at the time, described his erratic behavior behind the wheel, including “swerving in and out of oncoming traffic.”
Meanwhile, representatives from Uber have started in on damage control.
“Jason Brian Dalton had passed a background check, and was a driver-partner with Uber,” an Uber safety rep said in a statement. “We have reached out to the police to help with their investigation in any way that we can.”

Things look to be getting serious for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who just hit a relationship milestone right before the holidays.

The couple, who started dating this summer, just purchased their very own Christmas tree. According to the Telegraph, the British royal and the Suits star were spotted looking at trees at Pines and Needles in Battersea Park on Monday night (Dec. 13, 2016).
“I had no idea who he was at all. I was talking to the girl mostly — she was really nice. She told me that she was from L.A. and I said it was sunny over there and she said, ‘Yes, it’s cold over here,'” Zaqia Crawford, who served the duo, told the publication. “We talked about the food here and in the United States and what kind of things I like to eat here.”

The 30-year-old added, “He asked me what my favorite thing to eat here was and I said I don’t know, I’m home sick. They offered to help me [with the tree] because I was struggling a bit.”
Staff at the Christmas-themed store said the twosome held hands after browsing around for 30 minutes. While Harry didn’t buy a Christmas tree stand or lights, he did pick up a six-foot, non-drop Nordmann Fir for which he paid £65 (roughly $82). The 32-year-old also reportedly donated £1 to charity before carrying out the tree by himself with his girlfriend.
“The girl who served him is American so she didn’t realize it was him. Me and the other guy were netting a huge tree and eventually looked up and realized it was him. He had a woolly hat on,” Ollie Wilkinson, another staff member at the store, said. “Because his girlfriend is American they were chatting about living in this country and he was asking about how many trees we sold a year and how much we donated to the charity.”

“Then I gave him a bunch of mistletoe — he smelled one of the berries and said it ‘smelled a bit weird’ and [Meghan] said she liked it,” the 22-year-old continued. “Then they got into the car. They walked off holding hands with [Prince Harry] holding the tree in one hand.”
“It was a bit weird seeing Prince Harry browsing the Christmas trees,” onlooker Gary Spence shared. “I thought he’d go for the biggest one around, but he just wanted a little six footer.”
As previously reported, Harry met up with Markle in Toronto, Canada following his visit to the Caribbean. There, the 35-year-old actress was spotted wearing a necklace baring the initials of their two names.

The One Direction singer recently welcomed his first child with girlfriend Cheryl Cole, sharing the exciting news about his newborn in an Instagram post this weekend. Alongside a photo of him holding his son at the hospital, the 23-year-old wrote, “My close friends and family know there are very few times when I’m left speechless… wow!”
“I’m incredibly happy to welcome our new baby boy into the world, it’s a moment that I will never forget for the rest of my life and my favourite memory I have so far,” he continued. “I’m completely in awe of his incredible mother and how she has been the whole way through this, she’s really made my dreams come true. We haven’t named him yet but he’s already capturing hearts including mine. I feel very blessed.”



A post shared by Liam Payne (@liampayne) on Mar 25, 2017 at 1:25pm PDT



Cole, 33, also gushed about the bundle of joy, writing on her own account, “On Wednesday 22nd March Liam and I became parents to an incredibly beautiful, healthy baby boy, weighing 7lb 9 and looking like a dream. Although he still doesn’t have a name he is already stealing hearts,” the former Girls Aloud member shared.
“We are all madly in love and overwhelmingly happy with our little arrival,” she added, noting that the baby was born right before the U.K’s Mother’s Day. “Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers around the world. A day that now has a different meaning to me forever.”
Payne first met Cole when he auditioned for her during the 2010 season of The X Factor. The couple went public with their relationship in February 2016 before revealing later in the year that they were expecting a child together.

Trump and Putin Get the School Marm Treatment by Angela Merkel in These Meme-Worthy Moments from the G20 Summit/n
When the world’s biggest leaders come together under one roof, memes are bound to happen.
The social media star of Friday’s G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, was undeniably German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had two major meme-worthy moments — one with U.S. President Donald Trump and another with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The first viral moment came in the form of a photo of Merkel and Trump in which she appeared to be hiding her face in her hands in distress.
The Internet quickly launched a caption contest for the picture, with many agreeing on one sentiment: “Angela Merkel is all of us.”

Like many expectant moms, Serena Williams is celebrating her pregnancy by baring her baby bump for all to see.

The tennis champ graces the cover of the latest issue of Vanity Fair in (almost) her birthday suit, posing topless wearing just a pair of nude briefs and silver body chain. In the accompanying article, the 35-year-old — who is currently expecting her first child with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian — opens up about her journey to motherhood.
According to Serena, she found out she was pregnant in January 2017 — just a week before the start of the Australian Open.
“Oh my God, this can’t be—I’ve got to play a tournament,” she remembers thinking. “How am I going to play the Australian Open? I had planned on winning Wimbledon this year.”

“If you would have told me last year in October or November that I would have a baby, not be pregnant but have a baby, I would have thought you were the biggest liar in the world,” Serena says. “This is kind of how I am right now. This is happening sooner than later, and it’s going by so fast.”
As reported, the athlete announced her pregnancy this April when she accidentally shared a photo of her budding bump on Snapchat. She later confirmed the baby news by writing a letter to her unborn child, reading, “My Dearest Baby, You gave me the strength I didn’t know I had … You taught me the true meaning of serenity and peace. I can’t wait to meet you.”
“I felt like a door had been opened to a person who made me want to be my best self,” Alexis, who got engaged to Serena last December after a year of dating, gushes to Vanity Fair of his future wife. “I find myself just wanting to be better by simply being around her because of the standard she holds.”

D’Agostino and De Lesseps’ daughter Victoria, 22, “hated each other” — and got into a nasty brawl in recent weeks, a source exclusively told RadarOnline.com.
After a heated war of words, ‘Tom told her to ‘F*** off,’” a source claimed.
According to the insider, the Real Housewives of New York star’s son Noel also couldn’t stand her husband of eight months.

Now that she’s ditched her husband, the 52-year-old is planning to spend some quality time with her children away from New York.
A source claimed she is planning to leave for Europe with Victoria and Noel in the coming days.
As Radar previously reported, de Lesseps filed papers yesterday after a short, tumultuous marriage.
“She’s devastated and humiliated,” an insider told Radar.

A separate source claimed that frenemy Ramona Singer approached the newlywed bride at the RHONY reunion taping last month with more evidence of D’Agostino’s unfaithful ways.
He was notoriously caught on camera kissing another woman last year just days before the couple’s engagement party.

Hawaii Five-0's Daniel Dae Kim & Grace Park Aren't the First: A Brief History of TV Contract and Salary Disputes Hawaii Five-0 made headlines with the exits of series regulars Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim. The two Asian Americ.../n
Hawaii Five-0 made headlines with the exits of series regulars Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim. The two Asian American stars, who had been with the show since its start, exited ahead of the upcoming season eight. After their exits were announced, reports surfaced indicating the two stars were seeking a salary equal to their costars Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan. Kim, CBS and showrunner Peter M. Lenkov all addressed the reports in their own way, but this isn't the first time TV contract negotiations and salary disputes played out publicly."I will not be returning to Hawaii Five-0 when production starts next week. Though I made myself available to come back, CBS and I weren't able to agree to terms on a new contract, so I made the difficult choice not to continue," Kim said on Facebook.

"I'll end by saying that though transitions can be difficult, I encourage us all to look beyond the disappointment of this moment to the bigger picture. The path to equality is rarely easy," he concluded.CBS responded and said the show made the actors offers. "Daniel and Grace have been important and valued members of Hawaii Five-0 for seven seasons," the network said in a statement. "We did not want to lose them and tried very hard to keep them with offers for large and significant salary increases. While we could not reach an agreement, we part ways with tremendous respect for their talents on screen, as well as their roles as ambassadors for the show off screen, and with hopes to work with them again in the near future."

The Hawaii Five-0 news and exits came shortly after The Big Bang Theory stars renegotiated their contracts. The cast was all signed through the recently wrapped season 10, but went into negotiations for future seasons—the show was eventually renewed for two more years—with a twist. Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch were seeking raises to get their salary closer to costars Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar. The five were series regulars from the start, Rauch and Bialik joined in later seasons. To get their costars raises, Parsons, Galecki, Cuoco, Helberg and Nayyar all reportedly agreed to take $100,000 cut in salary. The original cast of Big Bang previously banded together to get raises, bringing their total to about $1 million per episode.

Before the cast of Big Bang Theory negotiated together, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards banded together for raises on Seinfeld. Then the cast of Friends—Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer—did the same. The cast was originally paid $22,500 per episode at the start of the show, but then raises were given that saw salaries in a range. The cast got together for equal pay, eventually topping out at $1 million an episode with backend royalties.

Like Hawaii Five-0, The Simpsons cast lost a member due to contract talks, albeit briefly. Throughout the show's lengthy run, the voice actors repeatedly sought salary increases and backend profits. In May 2015, Harry Shearer announced his exit from the series on Twitter. In a statement, executive producers Al Jean, James L. Brooks and Matt Groening said, "Harry Shearer was offered the same deal the rest of the cast accepted, and passed. The show will go on and we wish him well. Maggie took it hard." His characters were going to be recast, but his exit didn't last long.By July 2015, Shearer had reached a deal with the series to return.

"Fox is proud to confirm that each and every member of the iconic series' voice cast will be returning in the roles they've brought to life since the show's beginnings as a series of animated shorts nearly 30 years ago," the network said in a release.Not all contract negotiations go the way of The Simpsons.Back in the day, Suzanne Somers  and Three's Company feuded, with Somers seeking a big raise for her work on the sitcom at the start of season five. Somers wanted to go from $30,000 an episode to $150,000 (this was back in 1980). This caused friction with costars John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt, and Somers was regulated to appearing in the closing tags of episodes. Her contract was terminated and she went on to sue ABC.

 "My career was dead, because the public got mad at me for being greedy. And I was portrayed as greedy. And really what I was asking for I still think I deserved it," Somers told ABC News.Like Somers, David Duchovny also got into it legally with his network, in this case The X-Files and Fox. Duchovny sued 20th Century Fox Film Corp., alleging the studio cheated him out of millions in profits from the hit series. This was during the show's seventh season, and eventually resolved. Duchovny's Mulder appeared in only a handful of episodes of season eight and again at the end of season nine. He returned alongside Gillian Anderson for the 2016 revival of the hit series, but it was for those six episodes that Anderson had an issue with the pay.

Anderson was reportedly offered half of what was offered to Duchvony for the revival. "Especially in this climate of women talking about the reality of [unequal pay] in this business, I think it's important that it gets heard and voiced," she told The Daily Beast. "It was shocking to me, given all the work that I had done in the past to get us to be paid fairly. I worked really hard toward that and finally got somewhere with it."Anderson reportedly received equal pay for the revival.

Another 1980 contract standoff happened with Dallas. Even if you've never seen the series, you've probably heard of the infamous "Who Shot J.R." episode. The cliffhanger was huge for Dallas, pulling in record ratings. Series star Larry Hagman used this to his advantage and sought to increase his wages from $15,000 an episode to $100,000."In essence I broke my contract. And whether that's morally good or not, I don't know," Hagman told ABC News. He got his way. After all, he was J.R. Ewing. Hagman's deal eventually went up to $250,000.

And then there are times, like with Kim and Park and Hawaii Five-0, when the raises don't come and the stars get the boot or leave on their own. Valerie Harper's Valerie became The Hogan Family after Harper tried to get a raise and a cut of the backend profits after the series became a bigger hit in its second season. The battle became very public and lawsuits were filed (and eventually dismissed or won).While the show wasn't named after him, David Caruso is probably the most famous example of a contract-induced exit (aside from Somers) in recent TV history. After winning the Golden Globe for NYPD Blue season one, Caruso asked for a raise to $100,000 an episode. He didn't get it and coupled with his desire for movie roles, he departed early in the show's second season.

Contract disputes and raise requests are nothing new in the world of TV. While Hawaii Five-0 and Park and Kim's exits are just the latest examples, you can sure expect these types of stories to continue as long as television exists.

Uber Sued After Driver Allegedly Ambushes Passenger at Home With Metal Rod/nUber is being sued after one of its driver's allegedly beat up a passenger and then later showed up at his home to beat the dude up again, this time with a metal rod. David Riordan says he ordered the Uber ride home from a 2016 Christmas party in Chicago's Wicker Park. He says he was picked up in a Honda Accord by a driver named Munstr Abuseimi, who became aggressive, kicked Riordan out of his car, and then got out and punched him several times. Riordan says he went to a friend's house after the attack, where he contacted Uber to report Abuseimi, and about an hour later ordered another Uber to take him home. But Riordan says when he got to his house, Abuseimi was there waiting and attacked him with a metal rod from behind with the fighting words:  "Don't f*** with Uber drivers! " Riordan says the ambush left him with a fractured left orbital, bleeding in his brain, concussion and a dislocated jaw with nerve injury. He says he also had to get 9 stitches. He's suing Uber because he thinks the company is prioritizing profits over rider safety by not sufficiently screening its drivers. Riordan's lawyer, Ian Alexander of Goldberg and Goldberg, tells us they've tried to settle the case with Uber, but they've been unresponsive. We reached out to Uber, who told us while they don't comment on lawsuits, the driver no longer has access to the driver app. /n

Maryland Rescuers Save St. Bernard Stuck in 30-Foot Dry Well
/n
Mabel was running in circles after her rescue — which makes total sense since she was saved from the bottom of a dry 30-foot circular well.
A team of rescuers from Harford County saved the pooch on Sunday after she apparently fell all the way to the bottom of the well in Perryman, Maryland. And judging by the pics, it was a long, long way down.
“The dog has been removed from the well … alive and well,” said a message on the Harford County Md Fire & EMS Facebook page on Sunday. One of the two photos shared there shows rescuers using ropes and a lot of manpower to get the pooch out.

A later Facebook message remarked on Mabel’s adorable victory dance — which we really wish someone had captured on video.
“Mabel was seen running in circles after she was pulled from the hole,” it said. “She will be taken to a vet to be checked out.”

There is a disparity on their separation date as Holt claims they split up on April 27 while Kaplan states they ended their relationship on April 24.

Rachel Lindsay Shuts Down DeMario Jackson for Claiming She Wasn't Going to Pick a Black Man on The Bachelorette
/n

 
There’s certainly no love lost between Rachel Lindsay and DeMario Jackson.
On Monday, Jackson, 30, took it upon himself to discuss the former Bachelorette’s preference in men at length during an appearance on The E&G Podcast, alleging that she only took interest in white men during her recent season of the ABC reality dating show.
While Jackson admitted he was only in the house for two weeks before he was sent home, he claimed that “from the beginning, you knew that she was attracted to white men.”
“You knew that. No disrespect, you just knew,” he said of Lindsay, 32. “She had that vibe. From night one, we all sat down, all the guys and I said, ‘They’re going to have a black representative, either myself or Eric [Bigger], and they’re going to have Dean [Unglert], Peter [Kraus], and Bryan [Abasolo] as the final four.’ We all caught that. I mean, it was obvious.”
Jackson claimed he knew from the start that either himself or Bigger (who did ultimately make it to the final three) would be amongst the finalists.
“I said, ‘It’s either going to be myself or Eric,’ just for the fact that I feel like Eric and I both have … I mean, we have different but similar personalities and we’re both … pretty good for TV,” he said. “It’s either me, the wild and crazy black guy, or it’s going to be the very spiritual, down-to-earth, positive motivating guy. Then you have Dean because he’s f—— drop dead gorgeous, Dean’s beautiful as f—. Then you have Peter and Bryan, who from night one you knew that they were into her.”
Jackson went on to criticize the way he perceived Lindsay’s interactions with some of the men.
“What is portrayed out here is this sweet, nice, caring, compassionate girl, but it was like, the total opposite. There were times in the episodes where you could just tell that she just wasn’t interested in any of the black guys,” he said. “I remember one specific episode where she had her one-on-one with Kenny [Layne], and Kenny was telling her about his daughter and she’s just sitting there with this unbothered look. And then you see her talk to Dean and she’s just like, head over heels. You can kind of tell.”

In response to Jackson’s claims, Lindsay commented on a photo from the podcast’s official Instagram page that was promoting Jackson’s appearance.
“Says the guy that dated Lexi,” she wrote, referencing Jackson’s ex, Lexi Thexton, who appeared on an early episode of The Bachelorette and accused Jackson of having signed onto the show without ending their relationship.
“Demario never knew me and still doesn’t,” added Lindsay.

FROM PEN: Why Rachel Lindsay Didn’t Choose Peter Kraus — ‘I Just Knew He Wasn’t the One for Me’

But despite some of Jackson’s harsher comments — he also said he thinks Lindsay’s final pick and fiancé Bryan Abasolo was a “consolation” prize — he still sent both of them his regards.
“I’m not disrespecting Bryan at all,” he insisted. “Great guy … he was focused, locked in on Rachel the whole entire time. Much love to him, much love to her, and I hope they have beautiful mixed little babies.”

Which vampire vixen is coming between Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Elena (Nina Dobrev) on The Vampire Diaries?When and how is Blaine (Darren Criss) transferring to McKinley High School on Glee?And which CW cutie might be crossing the country to settle on another coast? We've got those answers and more in today's spoiler chat!

cmstevens77: Glee! Is Blaine transferring to McKinley? If so, how soon next season?Since Darren Criss is officially a series regular, we can't imagine Ryan Murphy could keep him out of McKinley High for long. We know his method of operation too well. We wouldn't be surprised if Blaine makes the transfer within the first three episodes. R.M. wouldn't dare transfer him over the summer and deprive fans of an episode devoted to Blaine finding himself at the same school as his adorable boyfriend Kurt (Chris Colfer).dayecarter: Can I get a Comic-Con spoiler? I'd love to know which cast members will be on the Glee panel.It hasn't yet been announced which castmembers will descend upon San Diego for one of the biggest entertainment events of the year. But two things are for sure: we will be at the panel and in the press room to get tons of Glee scoop, and Ryan Murphy and Co. will surely spill info on any characters who aren't there to represent themselves. Last year, Lea Michele and Cory Monteith were not at Comic-Con, but we still got some scoop on Finn and Rachel regardless. Breathe easy, you shippers.Luca in New York, N.Y.: Please tell me you have intel on whether or not his Groffiness Jonathan Groff will be appearing on Glee next season!We have some not so good news, at least for Glee fans. Jonathan was just cast in an off-Broadway show (The Submission), and it runs pretty much the whole time Glee is in production for the first half of season three. Our resident Broadway expert predicts Groff will be up to his ears in stage duties from August until the end of October. Unless Jonathan flies back and forth on his one day off while performing, Jesse St. James will most likely be MIA for the first part of next season. But who knows, The Groff may not like to sleep, so maybe he'll do both! Fun fact about his new show, True Blood's Rutina Wesley is also starring in it. 

McKenna: The Vampire Diaries!Imagine Velma Kelly from the musical Chicago ("he had it coming!") as a vampire, and you'll have a pretty good picture of new character Becky. She's a key figure from Stefan's past, and she's enrolled at Mystic Falls High to put herself in his path, reclaim his love and eliminate her rivals. She's going to be particularly mean to poor Caroline, but we're hoping Caroline surprises us with some newly discovered reserves of strength and shows Becky who's boss._Naty_: Since Kristen Bell was cast in House of Lies, will she still voice Gossip Girl?Because Kristen Bell's Gossip Girl gig is off-camera, there's no reason she wouldn't be able to step away from time to time to do her voiceovers. She is, after all, the one and only Gossip Girl, and the show could fall apart without her!aalso_o: When does Gossip Girl start filming in LA?It's an Aug. 1 for the filming for a seemingly Hollywood storyline including a casting agent and some possible real estate purchases. Does that mean someone (read: Serena) will be putting down roots in Los Angeles? It hard to imagine those Gossip Girls permanently in sundresses.

Tom in Brazil: Any news on Sarah Michelle Gellar's Ringer pilot? Thanks!Shooting on SMG's new show begins Tuesday, July 19. Yay! Producers are looking for someone to play a housekeeper who knows something is up with the switcherooed twins. Ruh-roh!  24addict: Please get as much info as you can on Torchwood! Love it! We also love Torchwood: Miracle Day and said so to creator/show runner Russell Davies, which is probably why he was so generous with his scoop. The Soulless Movement (those marchers in the creepy frownie masks) will hit home for Esther (Alexa Havins), whose sister "has a complete mental breakdown because she believes in the soulless," Russell told us. "She believes that the human race are doomed because they've lost their mortality, they'll never get to heaven. It's an example of the sort of extreme psychological reactions that society goes through and the soulless is just one of them—we get a lot of these different reactions all the way through the series."ReRecoli: Got any Rookie Blue scoop?Maybe you saw Missy Peregrym's blink-and-you-missed-it tweet announcing Rookie Blue's season three renewal. While her tweet is now MIA, there are good signs for a season three pickup including the producers casting a new rookie who will be working with Sam (Ben Bass). Unfortunately for Sam, and all you McSwarek fans, the seasoned soldier could also be a potential love interest for Andy in the future. Hey now, let's give the new guy a chance before we pull out the torches and pitchforks.

Lindsay in El Paso, Texas: Got any Pretty Little Liars news? We've got all kinds of news, good and bad. First: Ian's for-realsies death persuades the Liars' parents to allow the girls to hang out again. The bad news? They'll be spending a lot of time together in the hospital, where—wait for it—Emily (Shay Mitchell) is a patient! This does not look good for her swimming "scholarship," does it?Kimma_S: Any spoilers for Haven? Thanks!July 15 is finally the season two premiere. Yay! But if you were hoping for Audrey (Emily Rose) and Nathan (Lucas Bryant) to just make out already, well that doesn't happen in this episode. Sad face. We're still going to keep our fingers crossed for a make out sesh in episode two. But there are bigger things to worry about in Haven like the other Audrey Parker and mysterious lady from Duke's (Eric Balfour) past.Mayracansigno: Can I have some CSI: Miami scoop, I'll take anything you have plzz. I said please.We adore actor Ethan Embry so any opportunity to see him on screen makes us giddy. His return as fugitive Randy North in the season premiere will introduce the team to his children, including a very sweet boy who worries about where he and sister will end up. Calleigh (Emily Procter) will have to consider a surprising and heartbreaking offer.numbnuts666: Got any scoop on Blue Bloods?It's pretty uncomfortable and sad when you're out at dinner with a friend and her husband is found dead by a hooker. Well that's what Erin Reagan-Boyle (Bridget Moynahan) is up to when we see her again in the season premiere. Awful and traumatic and it's probably not a good time to ask to split the check. 

goldstaarr: Anything Nikita-related please! Even better if it's Mikita.This isn't really Mikita-related, but you never know how something could turn into sexy time for our favorite spy couple. Nikita's antagonist in ep two will be a villain named Joseph Mars who pretends to be an addiction counselor so he can use "experimental psychotropics to turn his patients into sleeper assassins." Sounds like a great setting for a romantic date, huh?Coco: Anything about the Castle season premiere?The Castle season premiere is called "Rise" and starts shooting on Thursday!Michaela: Anything on The Closer?Do you sometimes remind yourself of Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift , Carrie Underwood, etc. etc.? If yes, have your agent call The Closer casting office right now, because producers are looking for someone to play Missy Michaels, "sweet, spoiled, talented country pop singer who wants to make it in Hollywood," whose father is murdered. Brenda and company are on the case, because there's a chance that Missy or her mom done the murder just for the added publicity! Oh, show business, you so crazy.Chris in San   Diego: Breaking Bad scoop? How much does Gale's shooting mess up Jesse? The shooting of Gale messes up Jesse (Aaron Paul) big-time—and his pretty new house, too. As triple Emmy-winning star Bryan Cranston explained to us at the show's L.A. premiere, "He's in a dire position...That changes a person, when you have to do that. Right now Jesse is grieving, in a way that he can't be alone. He's haunted by his memories, so he needs to have activity around him. And Walt is just not understanding that. He's misconstruing that to be, he's not dealing with it. And in a way he's not." One person who does deal with it is Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito)—in a scene so shocking one woman needed medical treatment after seeing it on the big screen.

Bay's (Vanessa Marano) birth father, Angelo (played by the oh-so-handsome Gilles Marini), will be making his debut in the season finale. And it won't be a subtle entrance for Angelo. "He has a lot of secret skeletons hidden everywhere," Gilles tells us. "No one is really ready for him, so it's a big bang when my character comes into this world." And hopefully, we'll be seeing lots more of Angelo past the season finale, because Gilles has big plans for him. "I can't wait to work more and see if my character switches gears into being a good person, or is he purely bad? There are a lot of things we need to unveil," he says.CloisForever23: Any new scoop on what's ahead for Alek and Chloe on Nine Lives of Chloe King?Well, when we chatted with both Benjamin Stone and Grey Damon, we never got around to asking about the show because we just stared at all their hotness.

As Radar previously reported, the 35-year-old’s sister Venus accidentally revealed that Serena is expecting a baby daughter.
Earlier this month, after her second-round victory in the French Open, Venus, 36, was asked what the baby would call her. “She’s going to call me ‘favorite aunt'” Venus answered. “Every day we’re like, Baby Vee, Baby Isher, Baby Lyn, so we all want the baby to be named after us.”
The next morning, Serena was quick to shoot down the slip-up, insisting it was not the big reveal fans assumed.

“I think the surprise of knowing what you are going to have on that very special day you give birth is prob the best surprise you can ever have,” Serena posted on Twitter. “So to clarify what Venus said, I am always joking with my sisters to see what favors I can get them [to] do for me next.”
“I did not grow up with any brothers, only sisters and we all say ‘she’ more than ‘he.’ Unless I’m joking with my Dad or Alexis and I’m trying to con something out of them too. Hey I’m the youngest [of] 5 I’ve always tricked all of them what can I say!” she joked.
Of course, Williams’ pregnancy was announced accidentally as well after the star unknowingly posted a baby bump mirror selfie to her Snapchat story.

Sweet Valley High Twins Brittany & Cynthia Daniel Launch California-Inspired Lifestyle Blog: 'We're Promoting Beauty Within'
/n

The Sweet Valley High twins are back!
Brittany Daniel and Cynthia Daniel Hauser have stayed quite active since their days on the beloved novel series, but with acting aside, the duo have ventured into something completely different. In June, the twin actresses launched their very own lifestyle blog, The Sweet Life, which they’re billing as an inspired and intelligent lifestyle brand for women that covers everything from fashion and beauty to clean eating, fitness, personal growth and wellness to travel, home décor and parenting.

The California-inspired blog was a long-time coming, according to the 41-year-old sisters.
“I feel like our fans helped create this,” Cynthia exclusively tells PEOPLE. “They’re always asking so many questions about our beauty regimen, workouts, etc. We just started communicating with them and I feel like it evolved organically from there.”
Brittany and Cynthia Daniel
“I think that Cyn and I have so many interests that all go together perfectly,” adds Brittany. “I think secretly we just want to spend more time together!”
From celebrating the birth of Cynthia’s three children to navigating through Brittany’s cancer journey, the Daniels have seen plenty of highs and lows throughout the years. Together, they are combining their individual views on life and collectively creating a space that promotes self-love and a healthy, balanced lifestyle.





“We’re trying to promote beauty within,” Cynthia explains.
Brittany and Cynthia Daniel


“We’re all about living our best life,” adds Brittany.




Not only does their blog feature quick ‘How To” videos and “Britt and Cyn’s Take” on just about anything, it will regularly feature the experts in their life to contribute authentic editorial pieces, giving readers access to professional stylists, makeup artists, chefs, life coaches, interior designers, celebrities and trainers (including well-known Hollywood trainer Jeanette Jenkins).

Though the duo haven’t shared a screen together in quite some time, collaborating on the blog has brought them right back to their acting days.
“Cynthia and I worked on Sweet Valley High years ago so coming back and working with my sister is amazing,” says Brittany. “She’s my best friend.”

Not only that, but with blogging comes many life lessons.
“I think working on this blog with my sister is really preparing me to have a family,” Brittany, who is in the midst of planning a wedding with fiancé Adam Touni. “I’m engaged and am getting married soon! Soon I’m going to need to be bargain shopping like my sis!”





 I said yes! My world just became brighter today. #engagement #christmas #love #proposal #marinheadlands #family @adam.touni
A post shared by Brittany Daniel (@iambdaniel) on Dec 25, 2016 at 7:23pm PST


And though there’s no shortage of lifestyle brands on the market these days, the twins aren’t worried about finding a way to stand out.
“Our blog is going to be different because you’re getting two takes — my take and Britt’s take,” Cynthia says. “It’s almost like you have two blogs in one!”

Amy Schumer Feels Sexy When She's Covered in Dirt and Sweat (And Goldie Hawn Agrees!)
/n
Steve Granitz/WireImage
Comedian Amy Schumer has no problem telling it like it is, and always being an open book. Take, for example, the time that she dished about her sex life, copped to taking nude selfies, and confessed that she had to leave a party because she was sweating so hard. And in an interview with The Project and co-star Goldie Hawn to promote the new comedy Snatched, the actress kept up the brutal honesty, opening up about a kind of unorthodox time that she feels sexy.

The blonde duo discussed how they spent most of the time filming covered in gritty dirt and sweat to play a mother and daughter forced to trek through a jungle after being kidnapped. While it might be quite a change from the glamorous lives the ladies lead off-screen, Schumer revealed that she didn’t actually hate the messy conditions.

“I feel sexy when I’m dirty,” the comedian revealed. “I like the dirt and the sweat.” And Schumer’s 71-year-old co-star (who admitted she didn’t know who the star was before they worked together on this comedy) even agreed — dirtier is better! “Me too!” Hawn said during the interview after Schumer spilled her secret.
Besides making her feel super sexy, Schumer joked about how she discovered a secret makeup hack using dirt that could very likely go viral on YouTube soon.
“And it is good for contour. Dirt!” she said. Hawn replied: “Very good for contour. Can you put the dirt here? Maybe some over here.”

Two words: doggy daycare.

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp released an apology video on YouTube in repentance of the incident last summer wherein the couple was charged for bringing their dogs, Boo and Pistol, into Australia without declaring them while filming the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film.
“Australia is a wonderful island with a treasure trove of unique plants, animals and people,” says Heard in the video at the bottom of the page. “I’m truly sorry Pistol and Boo were not declared. Protecting Australia is important.”

The canine Bonnie and Clyde faced up to a maximum of 10 years behind bars and up to a $75,000 fine, but Heard pleaded guilt on Monday to providing a false immigration document and was given a one-month good behavior bond. This holds her at a $750 fine should she break any more laws in Australia over the next month, according to Entertainment Weekly.
The country’s biosecurity laws, which entail that a visitor with a pet apply for a permit and quarantine of at least 10 days upon arrival, are a standard preventative measure against the spread of rabies.
“If we start letting movie stars — even though they’ve been the sexiest man alive twice — to come into our nation (with pets), then why don’t we just break the laws for everybody,” said Australia’s Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce last May of Depp and Heard. “It’s time that Pistol and Boo buggered off to the United States.”

How Audrey Hepburn Finally Found Love after Two Broken Marriages — and Why Her Last Love Never Proposed
/n

After dealing with the pain of two failed marriages, Audrey Hepburn found lasting love at the perfect time.
At age 49, after her divorces from actor Mel Ferrer and pyschiatrist Andrea Dotti, Hepburn fell for Dutch-born businessman Robert Wolders, who in PEOPLE’s new cover story about the iconic star’s private world, shares the story of their love and why it lasted, though they never wed.
“We were ready for each other,” Wolders says of their near-instant chemistry. “At the time in our lives that we met, we had both made our mistakes. If chance would have had it that we would have met at an earlier stage, we might not have had the discoveries together that we did have and found those things in life together that were valuable to us at a later point in life when we were both more mature.”

Wolders recalls feeling that they were “meant to be” very early in their courtship.
“After I’d met her, a mutual friend prompted me to ask her out for dinner, but she said she had a night shoot,” he explains. “I thought it was her gentle way of rejecting me. The next day she invited me for a drink at the Pierre hotel, which turned into a three-hour talk. At one point she said, ‘Do you mind if I order some pasta?’ After many long phone conversations, we realized we were meant to be together. She asked me if she could take time to prepare [her son] Luca and Andrea, her soon-to-be-ex-husband. When she saw him, Andrea came over and said, ‘You look very beautiful, you must be in love,’ and she said, ‘I am.'”
For much more about Audrey Hepburn, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday. 
Wolders and Hepburn were together from 1980 until her death in 1993. When asked why he never proposed, Wolders says that they never felt the need.
“I felt she had two unhappy marriages, it was wonderful the way it was,” he says. “When Audrey would be asked, she’d also say, ‘Why mess with a good thing?’ I remember her saying to one interviewer it’s more romantic this way because it’s not another piece of paper, but out of loyalty to each other that binds us together. Had we been younger and wanted to have children, it might have been different, but that’s just not the case.”

Wolders adds: “She viewed us as being married. There were times in order to avoid confusion that she would present me as, ‘My husband, Rob,’ but never as, ‘my partner,’ or, ‘my life partner,’ or anything like that. What always pleased me or always sounded so nice was, ‘Have you met my Rob?’ Or, ‘This is my Rob.'”
Hepburn’s family, including sons Luca Dotti, who chairs the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund, and Sean Ferrer, who heads the Audrey Hepburn Society at UNICEF, are working with Christie’s for the family’s first-ever auction of some of Hepburn’s personal collection of dresses, memorabilia and more in London on Sept. 27. The auction house is hosting a preview in L.A. Sept. 12-14 and an online auction runs Sept. 19-Oct. 3.

Britney May Club for a Living/nSources tell TMZ Britney Spears is in negotiation with Bally Total Fitness to be a frontwoman for the company -- and backwoman, too!Here's what we know. Brit's parents have both been talking to Bally about making a deal. Daddy Jamie has the power as co-conservator to make it happen. It all happened because Larry Rudolph, who is coming back to manage the Britster, has a close friendship with John Wildman, the Chief Marketing Officer of Bally.During the negotiations, Brit has been going to the club at least once a day and up to as many as three times a day. She's training with two of the company's top personal trainers -- we're guessing one for the front and one for the back. She's also working with the company's nutritionist, who has put Britney on five to six quality meals a day. No Taco Bell, no Fanta ... life can really suck.

Single Mother Sweetly Dressed As 'Dad' For Father-Daughter Dance — But The School Turned Them Away!/n

Being a single parent is hard.
But Amy Peterson wouldn't let the fact that she's a single mother prevent her daughter Gracie from attending her school's annual father-daughter dance.
The Georgia resident knew the bouncers at the Locust Grove Elementary school event wouldn't let her inside the dance since she wasn't a man.

So Peterson got creative, dressing up like a dad to escort her 6-year-old daughter!
Amy rocked a mascara beard, baggy clothes, a bow tie, and a dress hat to complete her paternal alter ego — but school leaders still turned the duo away because Amy wasn't a man.
Peterson said she and Gracie were devastated they weren't allowed to go, telling WXIA: 

"I was trying to comply with the rules. I knew if I showed up as her mom, they probably wouldn't have let me in."
A school spokesperson claimed officials contacted Peterson hours before the dance to warn her they would be turned away, explaining:

"An hour before the school principal called, saying she caught rumor that her (Gracie's) mother was bringing her and she forbid us to come, and if we showed up we would be turned away."
The school apologized and offered a refund, which Peterson says doesn't make up for Gracie's disappointment for not being allowed into the dance.

She added:

"[Gracie] screamed, ‘No, why? Why do I have to be the one missing a dad.' She was just excited that we were doing this together."
Peterson is now calling for changes to the way this kind of dance is handled, and is willing "to fight tooth and nail to make sure this doesn't happen to another child."
Our hearts are breaking over this!
The tradition of a father-daughter dance is cute, but is it worth being so strict if you're ostracizing children of single parents in the process??

'Titanic' Composer James Horner Dead in Plane Crash/nHorner's assistant Sylvia Wells confirmed his death on Facebook, writing,  "A great tragedy has struck my family today, and I will not be around for a while. I would like some privacy and time to heal. We have lost an amazing person with a huge heart, and unbelievable talent. He died doing what he loved. " Celine Dion tweeted about his death, writing,  "Rene and I are deeply saddened by the tragic death of James Horner. He will always remain a great composer in our hearts. James played an important part in my career. We will miss him. We offer his family and friends our deepest sympathy. " A plane owned by James Horner -- the Academy Award-winning composer of  "My Heart Will Go On " -- crashed Monday morning, killing the pilot.   Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... the 2-seater S312 Tucano MK1 -- a single-engine turboprop -- went down at 9:30 AM west of Santa Barbara. We're told the pilot was alone in the aircraft when it crashed, but authorities have not identified the body. The crash sparked a brush fire, and there was almost nothing left of the plane.   Horner composed soundtracks for Hollywood's top directors – Stephen Spielberg, George Lucas, Ron Howard, Mel Gibson -- and won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for  "Titanic " ... which included Celine Dion's massive hit. 61-year-old Horner is a known recreational pilot ... much like Harrison Ford./n

Madonna’s brood is getting bigger again.

The “Material Girl” singer appeared in Malawi court on Tuesday (Feb. 7, 2017) to adopt a pair of twin girls. Though she previously denied reports about expanding her family again, the 58-year-old joined her lawyer and the two 4-year-old girls to oversee the adoption proceedings.
The children’s father and uncle were reportedly present to witness the adoption.
Mlenga Mvula, a judicial spokesperson from Malawi, confirmed the news. “Their mother died a week after she delivered the babies,” he said of the twins. “After their mother died, the children were looked after by their grandmother, who could not fully provide for them, so they were taken into an orphanage.”
Mvula added that Madonna “exuded happiness” and “smiled while she was making her way out of the courtroom” with her new daughters.
According to the Guardian, the girls — named Stella and Esther — were adopted from the Home of Hope orphanage near the western border of Zambia, where Madonna’s 11-year-old son, David Banda, once lived.
Aside from David, Madonna is the mother to Lourdes Leon, 20, Rocco Ritchie, 16, and Mercy James, 11.

“I remember being so sad and downtrodden after hearing that I couldn’t even go to an arts school,” the outstanding supporting actress in a drama series nominee tells PEOPLE. “And now this Emmy thing is happening. I feel like Cinderella.”
Wiley, who ultimately graduated from Juilliard, learned of her nomination from her agent while she was in the car on the way to a photo shoot. “I couldn’t believe it!” she recalls. “I was like ‘Me? Actually me?’ ”
Her first call after learning the news: Wiley’s wife since March, OITNB writer Lauren Morelli.
“We’re not both actors, which I like. There’s no competition there, but also she works in this industry so she understands it so much more,” Wiley says. “I just feel so blessed to be able to have her on my team.”



When your wife calls to tell you she got nominated for an Emmy so you run outside to scream and your friend @markceryak catches the whole thing (and strangers think you’re rude for barging through the door like a crazy person). Bursting with pride. ❤️❤️❤️
A post shared by Lauren Morelli (@lomorelli) on Jul 13, 2017 at 10:47am PDT


On set of Handsmaid’s, Wiley relied on her costar Elisabeth Moss. “You can only be as great as the partner that you have,” she says of the outstanding lead actress in a drama series nominee. “Elisabeth really makes me great.”
The ladies even had “little games” they’d play between takes to lighten the mood of the show’s heavy dystopian material.
“I keep talking about this cookie tray that comes out that me and Elisabeth are obsessed with,” the Los Angeles-based star continues. “We also have a little bet going on of what exact time we might finish that day.”
As for what fans can expect from The Handmaid’s Tale season 2, Wiley admits, “I do not know much.”
“The last thing that we saw was Moira overwhelmed from getting her health insurance card, all the money she got from the nation, and we’ll be able to pick up there and see what their journey is like,” the actress explains of Luke (O-T Fagbenle) and Moira’s futures in Canada. “And hopefully see — this is just my speculation — how they’re going to get the rest of their family back.”

Viewers will, however, get to see where the “unwomen” get sent when the series based on Margaret Awtwood’s novel returns. “We’ve sort of had to imagine what this place is and in season 2 we’re really going to see what that place is,” Wiley says. “We’re going to go there, see the women who live there, what their life is like, what’s their day-to-day.”
Until the series comes back in 2018, Wiley will take on costar Ann Dowd, OITNBs Uzo Aduba, Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown, This is Us’ Chrissy Metz, and Westworld’s Thandie Newtown at the Sept. 17 Emmys.
“How would I celebrate? Oh man. I’d probably faint,” teases Wiley. “That’d be how I celebrate. People would think I’m super excited, but I’m just fainting.”
The 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, hosted by Stephen Colbert, will air live on CBS from the Microsoft Theater in L.A. on Sept. 17.

From Nikki and Ian to Justin and Jennifer: Could These Celeb Couples' Characters Fall in Love?/n
The recent revelations that Ian Somerhalder of The Vampire Diaries and Twilight‘s Nikki Reed are in fact an item has thrown us into a tizzy. Here are two actors, from two completely different vampire franchises, dating and doing romance stuff – as if someone had turned fan fiction into real life.  
It got us thinking, how would some of our other favorite couples fare if we swapped each member with their most famous character? We know they’ve got sparks in real life, but would they still work on screen?  
Explore our findings below!  
Rosalie Hale and Damon Salvatore
If Prince William and Kate represent the ultimate fairy tale, Nikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder’s budding romance is the fan fiction you hush-hush scroll through before clearing your browser history. Together, The Vampire Diaries‘s brooding bloodsucker and Twilight‘s PFYT (Pretty Forever Young Thing) form the ultimate paranormal power couple with just the right amount of bite.  
Verdict: Their relationship would work if they could figure out how to kiss without their fangs getting in the way.  
Seth Cohen and Blair WaldorfAdam Brody in The O.C. and Leighton Meester in Gossip GirlFox;CWThis hypothetical union was a popular discussion topic around the time of Adam Brody and Leighton Meester’s surprise wedding, and for good reason: Seth and Blair have just enough in common for this to make sense – they’re two super-popular Josh Schwartz creations with a history of dating outside their social circle, if not their class – and enough differences to keep things interesting.  
Verdict: As long as they can decide which coast to live on, they’ve got a better shot than most.  
Alcide Herveaux and Gloria Delgado-PritchettJoe Manganiello in True Blood and Sofia Vergara in Modern FamilyHBO;ABCWe’re not sure if the True Blood werewolf could afford Gloria, easily the hottest thing about Modern Family if we’re not including Cameron Tucker’s button-downs. Then again – and how do we put this nicely? – shirtless Ed O’Neill isn’t quite as   fun.  
Verdict: Frankly, it’s a fire hazard. Like, is it hot in here or have we already spent too much time thinking about Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello’s IRL relationship?  
Chief Kevin Garvey and Rachel Green
Justin Theroux in The Leftovers and Jennifer Aniston in FriendsHBO;NBCShe’s a runaway bride; his life’s been torn apart by a mysterious event that may have just been the Rapture – are they a match made in heaven? The thrilling blush of true love doesn’t really exist in the universe of The Leftovers, but if anyone could get this small-town chief of police out of his existential funk, it’s Jennifer Aniston‘s Rachel – she’s got experience with mopey suitors.  
Verdict: A chatty New York waitress might be just the right match for a man whose estranged wife took a vow of silence.  
Troy Bolton and Letty OrtizZac Efron in High School Musical 3 and Michelle Rodriguez in Fast amp#38; FuriousRex USA (2)If this were high school, Zac Efron’s Italy makeout partner would be the tough girl who gets picked first for everything in gym class. No, Michelle Rodriguez’s Fast & Furious alter ego doesn’t care that you nailed it on opening night, and no, she will not perform a feverishly choreographed waltz with you at prom, no matter how good-looking you are (and whose yearbook photo was better than Efron’s in High School Musical?).  
Verdict: It’s complicated. What kind of car will Troy pick Letty up in for prom?   
Crosby Braverman and Veronica Mars
Dax Shepard in Parenthood and Kristen Bell in Veronica MarsNBC;CWThe Bravermans of Berkeley might only be a day’s drive up the coast from Neptune, but Parenthood‘s warm and emotional extended family might as well live in a completely different world from the seedy SoCal landscapes of Veronica Mars. In the hug-happy world of Parenthood, part-time record producer Crosby is a lovable mess, but compared to some of Veronica’s exes, he’s the very picture of stability.  
Verdict: The youngest Braverman would certainly find a lot to like in Kristen Bell‘s detective, but knowing Veronica’s weakness for epic love stories, we’re thinking he might be a little too happy-go-lucky for her.

Jessica Simpson and her sister, Ashlee, took part in their own version of Bridesmaids, at the Parker Palm Springs on Sunday, where they took part in their friend Lauren Zelman’s wedding to actor Bret Harrison.
Of course, given that she is nine months pregnant, Jessica could only do so much as a bridesmaid; according to reports, the singer-actress had to stay seated during the ceremony.

Also in attendance were Adam Brody and Josh Schwartz of The OC, as well as Ashlee’s adorable son, Bronx, who was the ring bearer.
It’s been a busy couple of months for the ready-to-pop Jessica. In addition to promoting her new reality TV show, Fashion Star, Jess also celebrated her baby shower with friends last week. (See photos from her baby shower here!)
What do you think? Should Jessica be taking it easy in her final stages of pregnancy? Sound off in the comments!

Britney Spears is hitting a small screen near you!






                    Leaving Las Vegas?
                







Britney Spears may not keep her residency much longer.

 MORE >>





Yes, the 33-year-old Princess of Pop is making a television comeback with a guest starring role on the CW’s Jane the Virgin.
Spears is set to play a foil to Rogelio De La Vega, Jane’s father and a telenovela superstar (played by Jaime Camil).
“We are so thrilled that Rogelio’s ‘nemesis’ — Britney Spears — has agreed to appear on Jane the Virgin in episode 205,” show runner Jennie Snyder Urman explained. “Personally, after hearing about their long standing feud (from Rogelio’s point of view), we are eager to hear Ms. Spears’ side of the story, which we assume is quite different. #TeamBritney.”
LOL! Of course BritBrit also couldn’t help but gush about the opportunity:

See u at the Marbella Hotel soon, @hereisgina @jaimecamil! 🙈 Guest starring on one of my favorite shows EVER @CWJaneTheVirgin #DreamComeTrue
— Britney Spears (@britneyspears) August 11, 2015

This will be Spears’ first return to TV since her appearance on Glee in 2010. Before that she also guest starred on How I Met Your Mother in 2008 and Will & Grace in 2006.
Jane the Virgin returns to television on Oct. 12.

Estella Warren Arrested for Domestic Violence/nEstella Warren was arrested for dousing her boyfriend in cleaning fluid ... TMZ has learned. The model /actress was busted early Sunday morning after an argument at her Marina del Rey apartment. Law enforcement sources tell us ... during the dispute, Estella grabbed a container of some kind of cleaning solution, and threw it at the guy.  L.A. County Sheriff's deputies booked Warren for misdemeanor domestic violence. Her bf, btw, is probably going to be okay ... we're told he declined medical treatment on the scene. Warren got out of jail Sunday afternoon after posting $20k bail ... which is a better way to get out of custody than her last arrest. We've reached out to her reps, but no word back./n
ICYMI: Chace Crawford, Michelle Trachtenberg & More Had A Sparkling Gossip Girl Reunion!/n

Gossip Girl fans rejoice!
At Elton John's AIDS Foundation Oscars party in West Hollywood on Sunday, several cast members of the iconic CW show had a mini-reunion!
[ Related: Jessica Szohr Dishes On Blake Lively's Baby! ]
Kelly Rutherford — who played Blake Lively's mom — shared a pic of her, Chace Crawford, Michelle Trachtenberg, and Jessica Szohr on her Instagram!
The caption read: 
"So happy to see these beautiful people (inside and out) last night. Chase, Michelle and Jessica #GG#PostOscars"
It must've been a long time since they've seen each other because Kelly totally misspelled Chace's name!
According to sources, Miz Rutherford showed the gang pictures of her children — Hermes and Helena — and they were totally blown away by their cuteness!
Also to join in on this nostalgic affair was Willa Holland, who had a recurring story arc in the series as Agnes Andrews!
This isn't the first time actors from the teen drama have gotten together.
As we reported, Kelly and Matthew Settle — who played Rufus Humphrey — are rumored to be dating!
Somewhere, Leighton Meester is totally jealous she didn't get the invite!

Angelina Jolie has been spotted for the very first time since filing for divorce from Brad Pitt.

On Sunday (Oct. 16, 2016), Jolie was photographed touring a new rental unit in Malibu with five of her six children and her brother, James Haven. ET reports the family, who was joined by a security team and the children’s nannies, spent over an hour touring the property.

Jolie wore a long tan cardigan and seemed in “good spirits” as she toured the property barefoot after playing on the beach with her children. “The kids were running around and they seemed happy and to be doing well,” a source said. “Zahara ran out to the beach by the water. The kids were playing on the beach.”
Pitt has yet to be seen since Jolie filed for divorce last month, but he was able to see his children for the first time during a supervised visit last week.

‘Fed Up’ Brittany Cartwright Finally Dumps Bad Boy Jax Taylor/n
Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor are finally done after months of fighting, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
“Brittany was fed up,” an insider revealed to Radar. “Jax wasn’t boyfriend material.”
“He didn’t treat her right,” the insider explained, noting that her parents agreed.

“Jax and Brittany had issues for months with her parents,” the insider said. “Her parents didn’t like Jax and the way he treated her or anyone for that matter.”
“Her family is her life, so she went back home to get clarity and spend time with her mom,” the insider added. “Brittany is happy to be back in Kentucky.”

Tonight is my last night in Kentucky 😢 I want to stay!
— Brittany Cartwright (@BNCartwright) August 18, 2017

Radar exclusively reported that Taylor, 37, and Cartwright, 28, first chartered into “rocky territory”  after filming their spinoff show, Vanderpump Rules: Jax and Brittany Take Kentucky. The country girl’s family was pressuring the SUR-ver to propose even though he wasn’t ready to take the next step in their relationship.
Producers tried to force the couple to work on their issues ahead of the show’s premiere, but they couldn’t make their relationship work any longer and Cartwright has since unfollowed Taylor on social media.
“Her family stress was too much and with the spinoff there was so much pressure,” the insider explained.

Cartwright and Taylor began dating after they met in Las Vegas in between seasons four and five of Vanderpump Rules, and started living separate lives earlier this summer despite their show together premiering on Aug. 23.
Meanwhile, Taylor’s ex Stassi Schroeder was dumped by Patrick Meagher on their four year anniversary earlier this week.

Christina El Moussa Models Her New DIFF Sunglasses Collaboration in a Bikini, of Course
/n
Jon Shoer 
It’s fair to say about 50 percent of Flip or Flop‘s Christina El Moussa‘s Instagram is made up of photos of herself modeling a different chic, stylish pair of shades. So she put her expert know-how to the test with a brand new sunglasses collaboration with DIFF eyewear.
The TV star decided to partner up with the brand because she loves the styles (a given!) but also because the company is focused on giving back. “I just really liked the style of their sunglasses so they asked me about doing my own line and I helped them design it,” El Moussa tells PeopleStyle. “Also I liked the fact that they are in business to make a difference.”
Jon Shoer 
For every pair of DIFF glasses sold, the company donates a pair of reading glasses to someone in need. “My goal of their partnership is to help many different people’s lives and empower and educate others in doing so,” she says. “They’re partnering currently with Restoring Vision so it’s basically when you buy a pair of the sunglasses they donate a pair of eyewear to people in need.”

For her new designer gig, she created a pair of oversize winged sunglasses in two color-way options — a tortoise frame with gold lens and a black frame with the blue lens — which are both available August 28.
Jon Shoer 
And for the corresponding photo shoot, she shot sexy bikini-clad photos in her own backyard. “We did it in my backyard and there were like six wardrobe changes and it was just fun.”
Inside Flip or Flop’s Tarek and Christina El Moussas Split

El Moussa’s notorious for her expansive bikini collection (she tells PEOPLE she owns about 40!), which is in part, thanks to one of her friends. “Well one of my really good friends owns L*Space bikini. I met her about 11 years ago and we’ve been friends ever since so she actually hooked me up with a bunch of bikinis so I have a lot.”
In addition to her perfect summer-ready swim wardrobe, her beauty look is always perfectly put-together thanks to a few products she swears by. Whenever she’s not shooting or on-camera she sticks to lashes and a pretty lipstick. “The line that I wear is called Pink Dust Cosmetics,” she says. “My favorite go to lipstick is Kate or Angelina.”

After her divorce from Tarek El Moussa she says she’s just focused on co-partening her children, Taylor Reese, 6½, and Brayden James, 1½. “To us our kids are our priority,” she explains. “They always will be so we just stay on the same page and we keep open communication regarding the kids and we work together three days a week at least so we’re able to just also see each other at work and talk about anything going on if something happens.”
She says she’s handling the new change by keeping busy, which includes shooting the new season of Flip or Flop alongside her ex. “It’s been good,” she says about filming. “It’s weird. We’ve always worked together, so for us it just comes naturally. We have the same crew we’ve had for a few years now and they’re the funnest nicest guys so it is just very fun. It’s very interesting.”

Steven Adams: Melo to OKC Would Be 'Awesome,' But ... /nOKC center Steven Adams says he's ALL ABOUT playing with Carmelo Anthony -- but warns that talk of Melo being signed by the Thunder is still just a fantasy.  The 7-footer was flying out of LAX when we asked about the possible move.   "That's just like saying if Michael Jordan could play for us. That would be awesome too. " He added that the rumblings don't really matter right now --  "It's all just like fantasizing. "  Speaking of which, Adams says he's a hardcore video gamer -- particularly when it comes to  "Dota 2. " And, with so many athletes investing in eSports, we had to ask if he'd ever try to go pro in the digital world./n
Chester Bennington Laid to Rest in Private Funeral/nChester Bennington's family and closest friends gathered for a private funeral near his home in Palos Verdes, CA. A couple hundred people attended the service Saturday afternoon at South Coast Botanic Garden -- many of the guests were musicians who'd played or toured with Chester and Linkin Park. A full stage, including a drum kit, was set up for musical tributes to be performed. Police provided tight security at the event. As TMZ first reported ... the family opted for a private funeral, instead of a massive open service. Instead, fans have organized numerous memorials around the globe for the frontman, who hanged himself just over a week ago. Fittingly, all funeral attendees had to have wrist bands and an access pass -- similar to most concert VIP passes. Chester was 41. #RIP/n

Jacko, O.J. Attend Johnnie Cochran Funeral/n
Wednesday’s funeral for Johnnie Cochran attracted a celebrated assemblage that included Michael Jackson, O.J. Simpson, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Stevie Wonder, Angela Bassett, Sean “P. Diddy” Combs and Magic Johnson – who said of the outspoken attorney: “We’ve known him for representing O.J. and Michael, but he was bigger and better than that. He represented people you’ve never heard of.”  
Cochran, 67, died March 29 of an inoperable brain tumor at his home in Los Angeles.  
As the Rev. Calvin Butts told the packed West Angeles Cathedral, according to the Associated Press: “Our brother Johnnie Cochran deserves a standing ovation from everybody in this house.”   
The range of attendees at the service reflected Cochran’s work in civil rights cases as well as his glamorous trials. Among the mourners from the legal community were Thomas Mesereau Jr., Gloria Allred and two members of the O.J. Simpson defense “dream team,” Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck.  
Simpson told reporters outside the church: “Johnnie fought for his clients.”   
Lesser known than Simpson, but still a high-profile onetime client, was another mourner, Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant who was successfully represented by Cochran in a suit against the New York Police Department, which had brutalized Louima.  
Said Louima of Cochran: “He was my lawyer and my friend.”

Amber Portwood is ready to discuss her and her fiancé’s meeting with Steven Hirsch, the owner of a major porn production company earlier this month.

Hirsch has apparently asked Amber to be in his movies before, but she decided to finally talk to him while she was in town for MTV’s Movie and TV Awards. Portwood and Matt Baier, her fiancé, confirmed, “The meeting with Steven and Vivid was very professional and low key.”
Portwood also confirmed that she still hasn’t made up her mind as to whether she would accept a sex tape offer or not. “It’s in consideration. I still have not made up my mind. I am not strapped for cash. I have a nice house, a nice life. I have everything I need. But I’m a business person,” the Teen Mom star said.
Even though Portwood said that she would use the money for charitable causes, her fanbase isn’t convinced.
Teen Mom Talk Now reports:
Amber had this to say to her haters: “I’m really stunned at the reaction from my fans!! If you have anything negative to say stop following now!! The judgment is terrible and I can’t believe people would just make up their minds without even knowing details or what was said!”

Kylie & Kendall Jenner Sued by Famed Photographer for Tupac T-Shirts/nFamily representative Todd Wilson tells TMZ the lawsuit is absurd as the sisters had nothing to do with the creation of the shirts. Kendall and Kylie gave their approval for the design but rely on their brand to handle the rest. Essentially, Wilson tells us,  "it's like suing an actor for being in a movie. " Kylie and Kendall Jenner ﻿have been slapped with a lawsuit for straight-up jacking Tupac Shakur pics and trying to profit off the work ... so claims the famed photographer in a new suit. Renowned photographer Michael Miller -- whose portfolio includes Eazy-E, Angelina Jolie and Jack Nicholson -- says he never gave the sisters permission to use his pics, much less to sell them on their website. The shirts have since been taken down, but that's clearly not good enough for him. In docs, obtained by TMZ, Michael says he never wanted to work with the Jenners, especially Kendall following her PR disasters (We're guessing he's talkin' Pepsi). As we reported ... the Notorious B.I.G. estate threatened to sue the sisters if they didn't take down the shirts. The sisters did and apologized, but Michael's not budging. He's suing for any profits they made off the shirts. We've reached out to Kylie and Kendall, so far no word back./n

Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon Has A New Hot Hollywood Player/n
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon has a new ‘Center of the Hollywood Universe’ — super hot Hollywood director Jeff Fisher!
Fisher is an Emmy Award contender for Hallmark channel’s My Christmas Love and now he’s hot on Bacon’s heels as the new-and-improved leading man in the popular Six Degrees parlour game — a concept that any two people on earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.
Movie buffs should be up for the challenge to find the shortest path between an A-list actor and the seasoned director.
In recent years, Fisher has worked with a parade of who’s who in Hollywood, including Kaley Cuoco (Big Bang Theory), Paul Wesley (Vampire Diaries), Meredith Hagner (Search Party), Leighton Meester (Gossip Girl), Parker Young (Imposters), Jennifer Lopez (Dance Life), Kim Kardashian (KUWTK), Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear), Nene Leakes (RHOA), Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie (Simple Life), Robert DeNiro, Samantha Bee (Full Frontal), Kendall Jenner (KUWTK) and the late Bobbi Kristina Brown, just to name a more than a few.
And using Six Degrees’ clever association trick, Fisher is connected to Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Ben Affleck, Margot Robbie, Ryan Reynolds, James Franco, Jennifer Garner, Blake Lively, Chris Pratt, Drew Barrymore, Uma Thurman, Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Ryan Gosling, Britney Spears, Harrison Ford, Jessica Lange, Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Cher, Justin Bieber, Goldie Hawn, and pretty much every A-list celebrity on the planet.
Quite a feat for the young director whose career is really starting to gel.

Meet The Guys Who Can Get You VIP Access To The VMAs, The Oscars, & More/n
15 years ago, cousins Rob Crawford and Ben Biscotti started their production company 1iota from almost nothing. The hope? To give die-hard fans easy access to some of show business’ most exciting and exclusive events.
Now, millions of tickets later, the concept behind the company has become vital to the entertainment industry. In 2016 alone, 1iota sent over one million fans to at least 3,300 events around the world. From the MTV Video Music Awards and the Oscars to the Super Bowl Halftime Show and the iHeartRadio Music Festival, 1iota is taking fans from the living room couch to the front row seat.
Rob and Ben spoke with Radar exclusively about 1iota and how fans can take advantage of all the amazing opportunities it has to offer. Read through to learn how 1iota can connect you with a once-in-a-lifetime experience you’ll never forget!
Radar: What exactly is 1iota and what service does it provide?
Rob: We’re a unique company in the sense that we connect thousands of fans with all kinds of events in the entertainment world. It could be popular TV shows, red carpet events, sporting events, movie premieres, festivals — it goes on and on. We work behind the scenes with clients, making sure they have solutions all the way from event management, ticketing, fan engagement, and casting, to deep dive data and analytics and on-site logistics.
Radar: How did you get involved in this type of business? What made you realize there was a need for providing shows with fans?
Ben: Rob was a casting director for MTV in the 90s, during the MTV Spring Break, TRL era, and I was on a path to becoming a lawyer. I began working with Rob my last year in college, and we noticed there was a growing need within MTV to provide fans for their projects and that these live audience shows were becoming increasingly more popular. We also began to realize that the more authentic fans we could provide for these shows, the better the end result was. The energy was better, the artists performing were more comfortable, the hosts were more engaged with the audience, and MTV was happier at the end of the day. Shortly thereafter, we decided to combine forces, utilizing Rob’s experience and contacts in the business and my legal and business acumen. We formed this company to provide the services we were doing for MTV to all networks, brands, and production companies nationwide.
Radar: Let’s say I’ve never used 1iota before. What’s the first step to getting tickets? How can a fan register to be a part of the 1iota database?
Rob: 1iota is unique because it’s free. All fans have to do is visit 1iota.com, create a profile, and then they can browse and search for events that fit their life, and request tickets to each and every event they want. It’s that simple. People come to the site for a lot of different reasons. Either they really dig a show or a host or a celebrity or a band, but then we find that they come back because the experience was cool and they had a great time, so then they’re searching for other things in their interest palate.
Radar: How do tickets work? Is it first come first serve, or is it a lottery?
Rob: It just depends on the event. We do all kinds of events, from first come first serve to lottery all the way to casting. It really depends on what the client wants and what the needs are for that particular project.
Radar: You’ve provided fans for The Oscars, The VMAs, and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. What are some other shows fans can get tickets to via your site that they might not know about?
Rob: There are a bunch of high profile events that happen throughout the year in addition to all the other daily shows that we work on — the one-offs we call them that kind of pop up here and there. For instance, we’ll provide the audience for live tapings of Will & Grace. We do the iHeartRadio music festival in Vegas every year, which is an incredible event, one of the biggest line ups you’ll see. There are also a bunch of different daytime shows from The View and The Chew to Good Morning America all the way to late night shows, sports, sitcoms, and game shows.
Ben: We have also added a bunch of feature film premieres and advanced screenings into our world. They’re great opportunities for fans to get close to their favorite actors.
Radar: What tips would you give fans who are trying to see a really sought after show? How can they better their odds of securing tickets?
Ben: We’re always looking for the most authentic, real fans for our events. That’s the bottom line. We recommend you always leave us some type of comment in our comment box when you submit your request, telling us that you’re a super fan of this show or why you’re the most diehard fan of that artist performing. Maybe a cool story that relates to the band or the artist. That could help your chances. When we do social ticket lotteries, do every social task that we ask and earn additional lottery entries, and maximize your opportunity there. Further, show up at our events if you have a reserved ticket. We track your attendance history, and we’re more likely to choose those fans that have a history of actually showing up to the event as opposed to those fans that reserve a ticket and never show up.
Radar: How many fans would you say you’ve provided with tickets over the years?
Rob: We’ve ticketed millions of fans over the course of 15 years. Last year was 1.5 million. So maybe 8-10 million when you count the early years when we were growing and learning. Last year we did 3,300 events, which for a company of our size is amazing. So you’re sending that many fans to 3,300 different experiences in the course of a year. It’s really something cool to think about.

Tom Cruise Gets Injured Doing Dangerous Movie Stunt/n
Tom Cruise injured his leg while jumping from building to building as he filmed a stunt for his upcoming movie Mission Impossible 6 in London.
As Radar’s video of the superstar actor shows, he performed the dangerous stunt on Sunday but wound up limping afterwards after landing hard.

Brave Cruise, 55, who loves doing his own stunts, was wearing a high wire during the building jump for the latest Mission Impossible film.
He tried to leap from a rigging next to one building onto another building. But he fell short and slammed hard into the side of the landing building.
Cruise attempted to limp away, but then collapsed!

The star took a moment, crouching down with his hand to his forehead, Tom Cruise style, and then then limped back to the edge of the building.
He floated back to the rigging area, where crew members took care of him and tried to see if he was okay. It’s not yet known how bad Cruise’s injury is.
In the past, the actor has been known for some sexy hijinks on set.
But more serious things have happened as many of Cruise’s films feature risky business. As Radar has reported, there has recently been a full instigation on the deaths of two renowned pilots in the Cruise starring war film American Made. They had allegedly fallen to their deaths.

Clyde 'Ace' Amerson from MTV's 'Real World: Paris' Arrested for DUI/nThe Southern frat boy from MTV's  "The Real World: Paris " was arrested this week for DUI. Law enforcement sources tell us Clyde Amerson -- known as Ace on the 2003 reality show -- was arrested and booked Wednesday morning for DUI in Carrollton, Georgia after allegedly rear-ending someone on the road. Cops say they responded to the accident -- in which nobody was injured -- and felt Ace was under the influence since he appeared drowsy, slurred his speech and had trouble with his balance. Our law enforcement sources say he admitted taking Benadryl and Rx pills. We're told police drew blood, and toxicology tests are pending. Ace was taken into custody and charged with 2 misdemeanors -- 1 count of DUI and 1 count of following too closely. /n
Marcus Samuelsson Doesn’t Care About What’s Trendy When it Comes to Taste/n

Take a moment to think about the last thing you ate. For me, it was a frozen banana rolled in organic chunky peanut butter and lightly sprinkled with coarse sea salt that smelled like a sandwich from my childhood.

I presented it to myself on a crappy plastic plate that was reminiscent of a piece of ‘fine china’ from my first Fisher Price tea set. It was cold on the tongue with a warm, nutty finish that stuck to the top of my tongue even after taking a sip of water. A riveting dish, I know, especially after having navigated a four-course dinner-cum-dining experience from the mind and hands of chef Marcus Samuelsson in collaboration with Pure Leaf Tea’s forthcoming Tea House Collection just the night before.

Samuelsson, who you might know as a judge on Top Chef, worked with the tea brand to define what components evolve food consumption into an ultimate taste experience. He defines taste as the combination of four elements: aesthetic presentation, fragrance, temperature, and texture. As guests of his inspired meal, we were led through four rooms that each contained a bite combined with a multi-sensory experience based on one of the aforementioned principles.
Take the first room for example, where we were greeted by visual artist Kamil Nawratil, who designed an interactive LED projection based on the molecular structure of oranges. The green particles reacted when you waved your hand or plate across the table, visually and sonically.

Chef Marcus Samuelsson's Pure Leaf Tea Dining Experience








































11 Photos »


Before we embarked on this mind-blowing journey, I had the pleasure of sitting down with chef Samuelsson to discuss how he developed these pillars of taste, how moving to Sweden to live with an adoptive family during the Ethiopian Civil War influenced his relationships with certain ingredients, and what he thinks about the “unicorn” trend in food.
Celebuzz: Let’s start with the basics. How do you define taste?
Marcus Samuelsson: Well tonight we’re going to redefine taste. I think about taste in terms of aesthetic, temperature, texture, and fragrance. When you think about taste in these buckets, which I’ve been thinking about and defining for a long time, it helps you understand the essence of taste and helps you experience it differently. If you have a cold, you can’t smell anything and therefore, you can’t experience the taste. If something is served at the wrong temperature, it’s not going to taste right, especially if you’re talking about tea.
As people who experience a lot of stuff, we have many ways to edit whether we’re going to be excited about something or not and I think that what’s been so fun about working with Pure Leaf is that they have been really, really curious and committed to finding the best craftsperson to take us on the most exciting journey to tell the story of flavors and tea.

CB: Given that you were raised in diverse global settings and later moved to New York City, how have your varied cultural experiences shaped how you think about food?
MS: Globally, you find tea in so many places, whether it’s the procedure of sitting down for tea, or drinking tea, or, in England, where you have high teas. I’ve been fortunate enough to live in many different countries like Japan, so something like Fuji apple is something that I’ve both worked with and experienced. Living in Europe, something like Valencia orange and Sicilian lemons are things that you think about. For me, the poignant experiences were when I went on vacation or when I was studying food. Something like wild blackberries we had in our garden at home in Sweden, so I’ve experienced every ingredient in different aspects of my life.
We’re all part of several communities in which we express ourselves. Breaking bread is one defining the drumbeats of one’s own community. I’m always inspired coming back from Africa about some of the most organic, simplistic ways of hearing sounds and eating food. When I’m in Sweden, it’s more minimalistic, yet the commitment to quality is there. When I come to New York, it’s all of the above on top of each other. This is how people dress, this is how they want to experience things through their sound, and this is how people want to eat together.
CB: How do you stay inventive as a well-traveled chef after finding a place in the industry?
MS: As a chef, you never stop evolving. You’re curious about how you can do flavor combinations that are exciting and interesting. That’s something that Pure Leaf is also committed to. There are easier flavor combinations they could have gone to, but they didn’t. They used bitter sage combined with wild blackberry, which takes a lot of manicured curiosity to develop.
My customers at Red Rooster come from Harlem, New York, and over the world. That customer base has traveled or they explore food online, so they’re very demanding. In Harlem, they’ll tell you right away if they like it or not, which is great. So I get the most inspired by my customers because they decide if they don’t like it and will go somewhere else. I think that’s a very honest relationship you can have because, sometimes, you need to get checked. If you’re committed to having this open dialogue, as humbling as it is, you’re going to get better.
CB: Have you found new ways of incorporating tea into your cooking through your partnership with Pure Leaf?
MS: Tea is an incredible taste enhancer and you can think about it in many ways. If you go to Southeast Asia, in Burma for example, they use tea leaves in salads. Where I grew up, we smoked tea a lot for fish. As we have done with these recipes here this evening, we’ve used these flavors, the core inspiration for the broth and the marinade so you will imagine them and re-experience them in a whole new way.

CB: What are your thoughts on something like the unicorn food trend that sacrifices taste for mainstream likeability and phenomenon?
MS: As a chef, you don’t really think about what’s trendy. You kind of have to think about things in terms of seasonality and really cook based on your own curiosity. Think about how long tea has been around. It’s not a trend, so tea gives you an opportunity to create more and more flavors. I do look at travel patterns because food changes through massive immigration, massive tourism, massive trading, which are things that take longer time than conventional ‘trends.’
Seasonality is really the key to cooking. We’re coming off of heartier stews and bigger meals to brighter spring ingredients, like peas and ramps, which lead up to rhubarb and radishes, then suddenly, you’re in summer. That clock is just a natural beat that nature gives us.
CB: Speaking of which, what are the spring ingredients that you’re most excited about right now?
MS: Think about something as simple as collard greens. Now I might cook them with mustard and I just kiss the mustard with the greens in the pan because it’s lighter. Ramps, of course, if I do something with pesto or something with vinegarette, I’ll char the ramps or pickle the ramps. I want to shave raw asparagus into everything, and that will eventually become corn. We think about the moment we’re in. Eating something like rhubarb when it’s in the height of their season is something that is just rubbery in its off-season. I think that making people aware of those micro-seasons will help them enjoy this collaboration.
Marcus Samuelsson is a chef and restauranteur who has 11 bars and restaurants worldwide, including Red Rooster (Harlem), Streetbird Rotisserie (Harlem), and Marc Burger (Chicago).

There’s another twist in this perplexing mystery.

As the rest of us struggle with getting our crush to return our texts, Making a Murderer’s Steven Avery has gotten engaged — again! — whilst serving a life sentence behind bars for the alleged murder of photographer Teresa Halbach. In an upcoming back-to-back episodes of Dr. Phil, Avery, calling in from a prison phone, talks about finding love again with legal secretary Lynn Hartman.

“I haven’t been in love my whole life. It’s not the same as the others. Everything is all different with her,” he tells host Phil McGraw, explaining that they fell in love when she started writing to him earlier this year. Avery, who met Hartman face-to-face only two weeks ago, adds that he wants to get married if he’s freed. “I want to wait until I’m out and I don’t think that’ll be too long; right around the corner.”
Hartman says, “The first time he told me he loved me was the first time we spoke on the phone.”
Found guilty of first-degree murder in 2007 alongside nephew Brendan Dassey, Avery claims that Dassey’s recently overturned ruling means he could get out of the slammer soon, vowing, “The truth is coming out and sooner or later all the truth will come out.”
Avery gained national attention after a 10-episode docu-series that chronicled and questioned his murder trial premiered on Netflix. Since then, a petition to pardon Avery was set up and Chicago attorney Kathleen Zellner filed a new appeal.
Avery’s interview will air on Oct. 3 and 4.

Good Samaritans Take Down Driver Who Crashed Van into Worshippers Outside London Mosque/n

Members of the public took down the suspect who drove a van into a group of worshippers outside a north London Mosque early Monday, injuring 10 people and killing one in an attack officials have called “sickening.”
Scotland Yard has called the incident a terrorist attack.
The 48-year-old man allegedly drove the van into the crowd on Seven Sisters Road, near a Muslim community center and a mosque in Finsbury Park, shortly after midnight when worshippers had just finished Ramadan prayers, CNN reports.
It was members of the public who wrestled the suspect to the ground and held him down before police arrived, according to CNN. The Imam from the mosque urged the citizens not to harm the suspect, witnesses told the man. He was arrested at the scene on suspicion of attempted murder and the incident is being investigated as a terrorist attack, CNN reports.

Eight people were hospitalized as a result of the attack while two were treated at the scene, Neil Baus, with the Metropolitan Police, said. All of the injured were members of the Muslim community, he said.
Police are investigating whether a man who was receiving first aid before the incident died as a result of the attack, according to the Associated Press.

Witnesses said that the man called out “I want to kill Muslims,” as they tackled him, according to the AP and multiple other news sources.

Adil Rana, 24, told the Press Association that several people were on the ground in the wake of the attack.
“The van was driving towards us to try and basically hit us at speed and everyone was shocked and people were screaming,” Rana said. “The driver jumped out and then he was pinned down to the floor and people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he’s done.”
Eyewitness Hussain Ali described to the BBC the moment that the mosque’s Imam intervened.


Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick: "London has woken up to the news of another appalling attack on our city."
— Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) June 19, 2017

“The leader of the mosque said ‘You do not touch him,’ ” Ali said. “He was sitting and holding him like that, people kept holding him.”
Police said early on Monday that there were no other suspects – and they are sending extra resources to places of worship, especially mosques, as the end of Ramadan nears.
“No matter what the motivation proves to be, and we are keeping an open mind, this is being treated as a terrorist attack and the Counter Terrorism Command is investigating,” Basu said. “This was an attack on London and all Londoners and we should all stand together against extremists whatever their cause.”
The Metropolitan’s Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said, “London has woken up to the news of another appalling attack on our city. My thoughts are with the family of the man who has died and with all those who were injured.”
James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock 
She added, “London is a city of many faiths and many nationalities. An attack on one community is an attack on all of us. Terrorists will not succeed in their attempts to divide us and make us live in fear.”
Meanwhile, Britain held another minute’s silence to remember those who died in the tragedy of Grenfell Tower in west London last Wednesday. Authorities say 79 people are known to have died but that figure is expected to rise.
The incident is the latest traumatic terrorism attack to hit the U.K., following the car and knife attack in Westminster in March, a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in May, and the London Bridge and Borough Market attacks earlier this month.

Celeb Shutterbug Annie Leibovitz Scores Big In Bitter $1 Million Legal Battle/n
Famed photographer Annie Leibovitz scored a huge win in a $1 million dollar lawsuit that accused her of stiffing her former financial adviser, convicted conman Kenneth Starr, to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Now RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that Leibovitz, who shot the infamous Vanity Fair cover of Caitlyn Jenner, has reached a settlement in the case, leaving her on the hook for a paltry $25,000 and ending the bitter legal battle.
READ THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS
Starr, a sketchy financial advisor who worked with everyone from Barbara Walters, Uma Thurman and Liam Neeson, was sentenced to over seven years in prison for fraud after he was found guilty of running a $35 million Ponzi scheme in which he stole millions from his celebrity clients.
Starr, 74, was forced into an involuntary bankruptcy in 2011, and the trustee has been attempting to collect the money from the fraud’s various clients to pay back creditors.
In 2014, the trustee went after Leibovitz, 67, accusing her of owing close to $500,000 for work Starr had allegedly performed for her.
PHOTOS: Nastiest Hollywood Divorces Dragged Through The Legal System
The ensuing lawsuit explained that Starr managed the financial and related personal affairs of Leibovitz from December 2008 through April 2010, including tax preparation work, investment advisory services and other financial-related services.
The trustee alleged that Starr invoiced Leibovitz for the work done from 2009 through 2010, but she never paid up, later insisting she did not owe a dime.
As part of the suit, the trustee also claimed that Starr had paid various people to whom Leibovitz owed money and demanded she be ordered to pay back a total of $1,035,102.89 so that he could use the money to pay back Starr’s many creditors.
Leibovitz fired back at the trustee’s $1 million dollar suit, demanding it be thrown out. The photographer to the stars pointed out Starr was sentenced to prison for defrauding her and other clients.

Leibovitz noted that no other Ponzi schemer has successfully sued his victims for money owed. She also argued the lawsuit should be tossed since the trustee failed to provide any proof she agreed to pay the invoices and no evidence of any agreement she purportedly had with Starr.
Now, the courts have sided with Leibovitz, and on June 8, following years of battling it out in court, the trustee filed docs explaining a settlement has been reached with Leibovitz. According to court documents, she has agreed to pay $25,000 to settle the case.
The trustee said the settlement is considerably low compared to the amount sought in the lawsuit. However, he admitted Starr’s criminal conviction would likely mean a jury would not look favorably upon any of his claims.

Mel B Refuses to Give Stephen Belafonte $4k/Month for Food/nMel B's drawing a line when it comes to footing the bill for her estranged husband's food, clothing and cell phone habits ... calling his  "wish list " a pipe dream. Mel filed docs shooting holes in Stephen Belafonte's request for emergency spousal support. For instance, she says the $4,300 for food and groceries he wants comes to $140 per day, or as she puts it ... a week's worth of food for a typical family of four.

Ditto for his $11k per month on housing -- she points out, he's just staying with friends. Belafonte also needs a new cell phone plan, according to Mel.

As for him crying poverty -- Mel says if he's working full-time at Serafina, and not making a dime, he  "should get a job at a different restaurant.

Sophia Loren Hospitalized/n
This we know: Oscar-winning screen siren Sophia Loren is in a New York hospital. Her publicist confirmed as much to E! Online Friday.             But why she's there is another story--or stories, depending on who's talking.            If you believe New York Daily News gossipmongers Rush and Molloy, then the 63-year-old former pinup is in New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center recovering from a heart attack. The Daily News claims Loren suffered "shortness of breath" Thursday while visiting a plastic surgeon friend.            Meanwhile, Access Hollywood quotes an unnamed source as saying Loren is in the cardiac care unit in stable condition.            But a hospital spokesman tells Associated Press the heart attck story is just "a hot rumor."            And Loren's Los Angeles rep, Beebe Kline, insists the situation isn't so dire. Kline says Loren told her she was going into a New York hospital for a few days for "observation." (What kind of observation, we're not sure--Loren's a fiercely private person.)             As for a heart attack? "If something had happened, I would have heard," says Kline.

 Outrageous New Tell-All Claims Sex-Crazed Bill Clinton 'Violently' Assaulted Women —.../n
Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers were just the tip of the iceberg that could sink Hillary Clinton‘s presidential run! RadarOnline.com has learned that an explosive new tell-all is making outrageous claims about Bill Clinton‘s secret sex life — including allegations of assault.
A former campaign adviser to Donald Trump, Roger Stone, makes the claims in a book, The Clintons’ War on Women, that is being rushed out next month.
“The most vile part of the Clinton story is about non-consensual sex…,” Stone writes in the book. “Clinton would get physical, tearing the clothes off his victims.” The book claims he bit at least three of them on the lip.

A lawyer for Clinton called Broaddrick‘s allegations “absolutely false.”
The “trademark” victim, according to Stone, is Juanita Broadrrick, who charged that Hillary’s husband accosted her at a hotel during his 1978 Arkansas gubernatorial campaign, “‘violently” chomping on her upper lip and throwing her on a bed.
Stone writes, “…Bill bit her lip so hard he almost severed it. Broaddrick said she ‘felt paralyzed and started to cry.'”

“Broaddrick said she will never forget how Clinton calmly donned his sunglasses…He then offered a suggestion for her mangled lip: ‘You better get some ice on that.’ He told Juanita not to worry about getting pregnant because he had the mumps as a kid and was sterile.”
Stone quotes witnesses including a Broaddrick pal who allegedly found her “in a state of shock, her lip swollen, mouth bruised, and her pantyhose torn at the crotch.”
When Hillary learned of the allegations, Stone claims she screamed to aides, “You will never believe what the mother—-er did now…”

“Instead of calling the police, she immediately began covering for her political partner,” the book claims. Stone also cites 14 cases in which Hillary allegedly hired private detectives who “threatened and silenced” Bill’s victims.
“If Hillary intends to build her campaign around an appeal to women, her campaign is built on quicksand,” Stone says. /n
Amanda Stanton Tries To Play Coy About Her Relationship With BiP Costar Robby Hayes — See What She Had To Say HERE!/n

Second time's the charm, right??
Earlier this week, Amanda Stanton stopped by the The Morning Breath podcast to weigh in on the upcoming season of Bachelor in Paradise. The Bachelor spin off made headlines back in June when production was halted over claims of sexual misconduct. While the scandal certainly affected the dating process on the show, it seems many of the contestants still found love while in Paradise.
Related: Eric Claims Rachel's Engagement Is Just A "Rebound"
Miz Stanton, who returned to Paradise for a second time after a disastrous engagement to Josh Murray, has since been linked to JoJo Fletcher's ex, Robby Hayes. In regards to her blossoming romance with the Bachelorette alum, Amanda simply shared: 
"He's sweet. He's really sweet."
Awwww.
However, Robby has yet to meet her girls, Kinsley and Charlie. We're sure Amanda is just taking things slowly this time around, especially since cheating rumors have already hit the couple. ICYMI, Robby was accused of having made out with another girl while at a Zac Brown Band concert. While one insider simply stated that the gossip "wasn't true," another confidant confirmed that the duo is "still dating and have been dating since they got back from Paradise."
Anywho, at one point during filming, Amanda really regretted returning to the ABC hit. She continued:
"When I first got back, I was on the stairs and I was like, ‘What am I doing here?' I like totally regretted coming back."
We mean, the sexual misconduct scandal must've been awful for everyone involved. Still, many of the stars returned to Paradise after Warner Bros. cleared the production of any wrong doing.
In fact, it was the two week break from set which helped Amanda embrace the fun side of the show's dating process. The fashion blogger explained:
"I think after the break I came back and I just had a lot more fun. It's a lot of fun. Since it was so short, nobody really took it as seriously this time."
Fair enough! On whether any of her BiP peers walked away engaged, the mother-of-two quipped:
"I can't say! I don't know."
Although Amanda DID suggest that a few couples may get engaged during the live finale as the pairs have had "time to date in the real world." Oooh, we hope this happens!!
Be sure to catch Bachelor in Paradise when it returns to ABC at 8 p.m. ET.

 Kris Jenner Debuts Fake Baby North On Talk Show, Reveals How Kim Kardashian Hid Under.../n
Kris Jenner debuted her new talk show on FOX on Monday with the type of self-promotion we’ve come to expect from the matriarch of reality television’s first family.
With daughters Kourtney and Khloe in the audience, the 57-year-old momager-turned-host fooled the world — for a few seconds, at least — as she brought out a baby from behind-the-stage.
The oohs and aahs ensued, but as it turned out, the infant was NOT baby North West: The tiny tot belonged to Jenner’s stylist.
PHOTOS: Reality TV’s Top Families
“No, no, no, I couldn’t do that to Kim — that would be kidnapping,” a grinning Jenner told the studio audience. “I get asked all the time, when are you going to show the baby? Kim just has to do that on her own time. Let her have privacy for a little bit. When she comes out, she comes out.”
Still, Jenner wasted little time shedding new details on the birth of her granddaughter, revealing a “Bonnie and Clyde” experience with pregnant Kim, 32, in order to get her to hospital to deliver her first child last month.
“It was actually Father’s Day weekend and I was doing live television, Good Day LA,” Jenner said within minutes of the show’s opening.
“I hate opening up my Blackberry after that because you never know what you are going to get. I get an email from Kim, ‘Urgent!’
PHOTOS: They Really Did Say It! 50 Outrageous Kardashian Quotes
“The backstory is that for Father’s Day she had planned this big surprise for Kanye. He is obsessed with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak from Apple. Kim wanted to get a piece of memorabilia — an Apple mouse, or something like that — that she could get autographed.
“She started researching and could not find anything. So, she just ended up emailing Steve Wozniak, Woz. She says, ‘Can I get something for Kanye?’ He says, ‘Yes, I would love that, let’s hook it up and I will actually drive it to you.’
“They have this huge, fabulous surprise for Kanye for Father’s Day. He has no idea he is going to meet one of his idols, get some signed stuff and have this amazing brunch.
“Cut to, she emails me, ‘Call me urgent!’ That is never good. When Kim says urgent, that is never goodŠ She says, ‘I have to have the baby today. Emergency. Get here fast.'”
PHOTOS:  Kanye West Isn’t Part Of New Keeping Up With The Kardashians Cast Pics
Jenner recounted pleading with the limousine driver — “a complete stranger” — to drive her to Kim’s house.
“In front of Kim’s house there are about 300 paparazzi that live outside,” she said. “They are all on baby watch, because, who knows? The guy take a detour and we get to Kim’s house. The moment I turned the corner, they’re all freaking out.
“I get inside the gates, get inside, get Kim, get her ready to go. We are packing her bags and getting them all into the trunk. This is crazy.”
Jenner said the family had previously orchestrated an “elaborate plan” — complete with “security, the right room, the car, a decoy car and this and that” — to usher Kim to hospital.
But their best laid plans were ruined.
PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian’s Baby Shower
She said, “On the way, I called my girlfriend, Farnaz. ‘We need a decoy car. We need a getaway car. Meet us at this hotel.’ When we get to the hotel, we were going to switch cars. We started to line the whole thing up.
“We go to the hotel, the whole way down to the hotel, she [Kim] is under the blankets and I hear tap, tap, tap. I go, ‘Who are you emailing under the blanket when this is an emergency?’
“She goes, ‘I have got to call Steve Wozniak. He keeps emailing. He’s here. He just got here and I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what to tell him.’
“I said, ‘Could you stop with Woz.’ I said, ‘This is going to wait. We will deal with that tomorrow. It’s all going to be ok. Let’s just get to the hospital.'”
Everything was going perfectly, said Jenner. When they arrived at the hotel, friend Farnaz had the getaway car in position.
PHOTOS: Kris Jenner Shows Off Her Massive Trout Pout
“It is smooth as silk and then all of a sudden, I am about to get out of the car and who do you think is standing at the hotel? Steve Wozniak,” she said.
“Kim was about to pop up (form under the blanket) and I said, ‘Kim you are never going to believe who is here. Steve Wozniak and his wife Janet are standing right there. She goes, ‘Oh my god, oh my god!’
“She hadn’t responded to him and didn’t know he was staying at that hotel. I said, ‘Kim you are going to have to pop up and go to SteveŠ just go and say hi.’
“She gets out of the car like nothing has happened. ‘Hi Steve, how are you? Thanks for coming.’ She is acting like nothing has happened; she is acting like she is at a cocktail party. I am frantic. Farnaz is ready with the getaway car. I kept walking over and saying, ‘We have a meeting.’
“We finally walked over to the car and Kim slides in, blankets, blankets, blankets. Purse, purse, purse. I get in the front and go, ‘Let’s go.'”

Then, Kim, from under the blankets, told her mom: “Mom, hit the floor!”
“I go, ‘What?’ ‘Lay down on the floor,’ she said. I go, ‘We’re in a Mini Coupe, I have a dress on and no underwear. How am I going to get on the floor?’ It was a little, tiny car,” said Jenner.
“I did not ask questions. I hit the floor. This is our life!”
When the trio got to the hospital, Jenner called security and they were all soon parachuted into a “secret garage, down the secret alley, where the wheelchair is waiting.”
She recalled, “Up the private elevator, down through the kitchen, up down, up down. We ended up in a room — and then we had a baby!”
Two days later, on Father’s Day, Jenner laughed as she said: “Guess who was in the room when I got to the hospital? Steve Wozniak!”
Interesting side note: Jenner dismissed two rumors about Kim and Kanye, 36, during the first episode of Kris.
She denied “locking” Kim inside a home until the first baby photos were released and said the couple will not be getting married in Egypt, as had been reported. /n
We Tried It: Cutting Out All Sugar, Gluten, Alcohol and Caffeine for the 28-Day Gut Makeover
/n

 
What It Is: The Gut Makeover is a plan to help nourish your gut, improve your health and lose weight over a 28-day period
Who Tried It: Rennie Dyball, Senior News Editor
Why We Tried It: To see how much torture I can withstand. Also: lose weight and improve my health and all that.
Level of Difficulty: 7. This is not for sissies.
The Plan:
As someone who’s had mild, recurring GI issues for as long as I can remember, the idea of making over my insides is appealing. And I haven’t had much luck losing the last of my baby weight.

Nutritional therapist Jeannette Hyde promises to help on both fronts — and more — in her book, The Gut Makeover, new to the U.S. as of May. In the four-week plan you cut out all gluten, sugar, dairy (certain gut-friendly dairy gets added back in the second two weeks), alcohol and caffeine to heal your gut from the damage that a typical Western diet can do.
An abundance of beige foods–rather than a ton of fruits and vegetables plus oils, nuts and healthy proteins–coupled with processed foods, artificial sweeteners, too much caffeine and too much alcohol can apparently do a number on your system. (Go figure.)
Goodbye for now, dear friendRennie Dyball 
Another fond farewell …Rennie Dyball 
By cutting all of these things out and eating a rainbow of plants and proteins, you can restore the healthy bacteria in your gut, Hyde says, which will result in an overall healthier mind and body. Plus, most people lose 6-13 lbs. in that first month. After the 28 days, you slowly reintroduce the food groups you’d taken out, while incorporating many of the principals in the plan for the long haul. Thankfully, Hyde is not anti-gluten, as long as you don’t have a sensitivity to it. You simply take it out (along with the dairy, sugar, alcohol and caffeine) for the 28 days as a reset for your body.
The basic principal to remember when it comes to this plant-based plan is 5 cups of vegetables and 2 cups of fruits a day. I was lucky if I ate 5 cups of vegetables a week previously. And the more variety the better.
My colorful grocery cartRennie Dyball
The Real Story:
The first few days of The Gut Makeover were rough. Really rough. Hyde suggests phasing out caffeine slowly over the course of a week before you start. So my caffeine withdrawal headaches were, thankfully, pretty minimal, but the fatigue was not. We are talking fight-to-stay-awake-past-4-p.m. tired. And the brain fog that accompanied it was intense. I’d park my car at Whole Foods, where they now know me by name, and not only forget where I’d parked but have no recollection of even driving there! Totally bizarre.
It was only a few days, however, before I started to notice a change. For someone who depended on Lean Pockets and microwave pizzas in a pinch (okay, more like multiple times a week), the idea of cooking from scratch daily was daunting. How is this possible with two small children and a full time job? It was not easy, which leads me to …
The Cheats:
Because I’m pressed for time, I often bought the pre-cut fruits and vegetables at the grocery store to save time on prep. This was not easy on the wallet, to say the least. Neither was what came next.
Making myself three meals a day, every day, quickly became impossible for me, but I have a salad place just down the street with every vegetable you can imagine, plus proteins, for $9 a piece. Not cheap, but still key when you’re pressed for time. I also learned to love sashimi while on the plan and picked that up for dinner when I couldn’t cook.
As Hyde notes in the book, this is not a plan you can do at 80 percent and expect to see results. You have to follow it as close to the letter as possible, implementing new habits — like following a strict 12-hour fast between your last evening meal and breakfast the following morning. I followed the plan like a good little soldier in every way but one … snacking. I asked the author why her plan seems to contradict the prevalent thinking that people should eat several small meals a day.
“The latest science seems to have turned much of that on its head and it was hard for even me to accept what the new research was showing,” Hyde told PEOPLE. “Having gaps between meals gives the gut bacteria a chance to repopulate, so the 12-hour overnight gap is the most important one to implement if you want to eat heartily and lose weight.”
“A gap of 12 hours or more creates a healthier microbiome (more diverse and lots of healthy varieties growing) that then means you extract less calories from your diet overall.”
Cannot argue with that!
Hyde said that it’s more important to keep the 12-hour overnight fast than to skip snacking entirely. I didn’t always snack, and when I did I made better choices. Previously I’d go for popcorn and a yogurt or a Kind bar, but I’ve swapped those for an apple with almond butter or a big handful of mixed nuts and I feel even more satisfied. And I don’t think the healthy snacks when I needed them hurt me too much because …
The Verdict:
I lost exactly 10 pounds in 28 days! And not to sound like an infomercial or anything, but I was truly never hungry. It was the first time, maybe in my life, that I ate real food, and an abundance of it, every single meal, every single day. My GI symptoms all but disappeared, too.
Before and (10 pounds) after!Rennie Dyball
 
I will say I missed coffee every day (sometimes every hour of every day) on The Gut Makeover. The taste, the caffeine boost, even just the ritual of it was something I came to realize was actually an important part of my day. But after this experiment, I’ve learned to be more mindful about it. Coffee in moderation is okay, but the author says that many of us need to rein in our addiction.
On my first day off the plan, I was delighted to find that just a half-caf iced coffee did the trick and, for the first time in my adult life, I didn’t need any sugar in my morning drink. Just a little milk, which was also nice to have again. Even more shocking: I ate the same way, voluntarily, off the plan as I did on it.
I’ve learned to love eating a lot of vegetables, words I never thoughts I’d type, and picked up on great new ways to prepare them, too. The Gut Makeover includes recipes but I also found myself going to friends and websites for new recipes and tweaks.
And while my love affair with coffee never wavered, I did not miss alcohol or sugar — at all — after the first few days. I was as shocked as you are.
A rear view “after”Rennie Dyball
At the end of the day, I’d call this plan a huge success: Significant weight loss, healthy habits to carry forward, less dependency on sugar and caffeine and reduced cravings. Plus, there’s an overall feeling of well-being that I’m now fueling my body with better stuff for it. I’m a vegetable convert now, and proud of it.

Rick Salomon Accused of Brutality, Conspiracy/n
After the March 2008 annulment of his marriage to Pamela Anderson, Rick Salomon has popped up in headlines again for something far more controversial than failing to uphold his wedding vows. 
A suit filed last week in Los Angeles has pinned the 40-year-old hanger-on and his roommate with brutality charges, according to TMZ.
Gertrude Harutunian is an alleged victim of a conspiracy to “hurt and injure” at a party said to be thrown last July at the Hollywood Hills residence Salomon shares with roomie Buddy Segal. 
Harutunian claims she was invited to the soiree where narcotics like cocaine, meth and marijuana were “freely given out,” fueling Segal into a fit of rage.
She claims Segal dragged her by the hair off of a bed, proceeded to strike and hit her before throwing her across the room and into a shower, all while Salomon watched. 
Haruntunian’s requested damages are undisclosed.
Salomon was first famous for dating and marrying Beverly Hills: 90210 starlet Shannen Doherty.  After their marriage was annulled (a theme?), Rick became infamous as Paris Hilton’s costar and distributor of the heiress’s 2004 sex tape, 1 Night in Paris.
TMZ points out an interesting correlation with Salomon’s current residence—it happens to be the same property where the only recorded incident of domestic violence between OJ Simpson and his brutally murdered wife Nicole Brown Simpson occurred.

Casey Kasem's Widow SLAMS His Children With Wrongful Death Lawsuit/n
The widow of Casey Kasem is suing the famous DJ’s children, for what she calls the “homicidal guardianship scam” that ended with her husband’s death, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.
As Radar reported, Kasem, long known as the voice of “American Top 40,” passed away from a form of dementia in 2014, after his adult children voted to pull the plug on their long-suffering father.
But stepmom Jean says Julie, Kerri and Mike never had the right to decide his fate, and is now suing them for wrongful death.
According to court documents, Jean claims the kids made their dad sign a power of attorney agreement back in 2007, when he was “under duress” while recovering from surgery. They then allegedly kept that document a secret for the next six years, until they finally revealed it to gain control over Casey’s care.
PHOTOS: You Can Sue For That? The 53 Wackiest Lawsuits
The lawsuit claims on June 1, 2014, the kids forced Casey to a hospital far away from his home, in a different county, for a “medical evaluation.”
“Defendant Kerri Helen Kasem kept Casey Kasem entrapped in St. Anthony Hospital, when there was no medical basis for doing so,” the suit alleges. “Casey Kasem was then kept at St. Anthony’s hospital for an unauthorized ‘overnight observation.’”
But when Jean tried to take her husband home the next day, she was denied. On June 3, Jean’s lawyer claims the family, using their power of attorney, “unilaterally and immediately began withholding Casey Kasem’s hydration, nutrition, and all proactive medical care.”
Jean and daughter Liberty were then BANNED from even entering the hospital, and only given five minutes to say goodbye to Casey before being escorted out.
PHOTOS: Drugs, Lawsuits, Sex & More! Prince’s Wildest Scandals & Rumors EXPOSED
It was the last time Jean would ever see her husband alive.
According to the lawsuit, Jean is suing for unspecified damages.
Radar readers know Jean has had a long-standing feud with Casey’s kids. Kerri even told authorities that her father’s wife of 34 years subjected him to elder abuse, after a move out of a California hospital to a private home in Washington left him with life-threatening bedsores.
“We have statements — and so do the police — from nurses about Jean and the way she allegedly treated her husband,” private investigator Logan Clarke told Radar. “When Jean took Casey out (of the facility), she was told ‘You cannot disconnect him from his feeding tube — If you do, he will die!’ The tube was surgically implanted in his stomach, so she took the feeding machine.”
PHOTOS: Janice Dickinson Stays Silent Over Bill Cosby Lawsuit
Nursing home workers let her take the machine “because it was the only thing that would keep Casey alive,” Clarke said.
Investigators were never able to examine his remains, since Jean shipped his body out of the United States to Norway, where it was eventually buried.

No meet-and-greet on the steps of the hospital for Jimmy Fallon.Resorting to more common ways of introducing one's newborn baby to the world, the proud papa posted a photo of his 2-day-old daughter on Instagram today."I would like to introduce... Winnie Rose Fallon," the Late Night host wrote. Winnie, his first child with wife Nancy Juvonen, was born Tuesday.

"Welcome, everybody, to Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. I'm your host, Dada," he joked during Wednesday's monologue, back in LOL action after having only missed one night of work to attend to baby business."I'm emotionally drained. I'm a father of a beautiful baby girl, she's so cute. Her name is Winnie Rose Fallon," the new dad revealed, "and she's so cute. She's 5 pounds, 9 ounces. "I got down to the ounce—that's how I weigh myself as well. I've gotta lose a couple of ounces."And no, he hasn't forgotten about that other kid born across the pond just one day before his own daughter. "Yes, William and Kate, we'll definitely set up a playdate—stop bothering me!" Fallon sighed. "I saw the invitation on the easel, yes!"

help from that psychic dolphin in the '90s cult flick Johnny Mnemonic? Just like that. 5. Luminos! Emma Watson Gets a Spell Cast On Her: As a child Ila (Watson) is tragically made barren. Good thing Grandpa Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) .../n
Moviegoers flocked to see Paramount's epic telling about one of the Bible's most well known prophets, Noah. Russell Crowe is the quite carpenter armed with a mighty ax. Big on spectacle and thankfully, a layered performance by Crowe, the film is directed by Darren Aronofsky who first gained attention for cutting off Jared Leto's arm in Requiem for a Dream. The film also stars Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, Ray Winstone, Logan Lerman and Anthony Hopkins.Either way, we've come a long way from Ned Flanders singing that "Arky Arky" song to Homer Simpson. Here's what you can expect when you aboard the ark:1. Leniency on Biblical Accuracy Equals Rock Angels: There's been plenty of controversy over Hollywood making a full-scale film about one of the most treasures sections in the Book of Genesis. Noah receiving help from fallen angels that look like they're from Middle Earth certainly takes poetic license. (Nick Nolte supplies on the voices for the fallen.) Verdict: Go with it.

2. Dark Noah: The Black Swan of the Seas: First brought to the screen in 1928 film Noah's Ark, nearly every version as been animated, humorous and not at all morally gray. Co-writer and director Aronofsky (The Wrestler) took a very different approach: seeing it as the first end-the-world story. Noah as played by Russell Crowe is so dedicated with completing his task—to let the Creator reboot the Earth—that he's willing with do away with humanity altogether, including his own family. A scene in the woods where Noah makes a life and death decision is horrifying. Like Natalie Portman's Nina Sayers, Noah is focused solely on the perfect execution of his task, no matter the cost. 3. Epic Flood Scene Delivers:.With a production budget estimated at $125 million, the size of the ark and the intensity of great flood are massive. Production designer Mark Friedberg was tasked with building it by hand according to biblical specifications. Most chilling, however, are the fates of those who didn't get onboard

4. Visions From the Creator More Effective Than Bill Cosby's God Voice: One of Cosby's most memorable stand-ups was the voice of the God speaking to a modern day Noah. ("I want you to build an ark!" "Riiiight.") Presented as wordless dreams, Crowe experiences the sensation of drowning and much more. The mystery of what exactly happened between Adam, Eve, the snake and that apple are parsed out like a riddle to be solved. Remember when Keanu Reeves needed help from that psychic dolphin in the '90s cult flick Johnny Mnemonic? Just like that.5. Luminos! Emma Watson Gets a Spell Cast On Her: As a child Ila (Watson) is tragically made barren. Good thing Grandpa Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) has the healing touch. No wands required.6. Contrived Melodrama Should Have Been Left Behind: After the incredibly visceral flooding of the world two plot strands need to be addressed before the final credits roll. Without spoiling, one is Biblical yet holds no suspense while the other is fabricated, feeling like some deleted scenes from Braveheart. Before that Noah impresses.

 William & Harry Mourn Princess Diana's Death In New Documentary: It's Still So 'Raw'.../n
In a new heartbreaking documentary Diana: Our Mother, Her Life and legacy, Prince William and Prince Harry share their most intimate memories of their mother, including their last phone calls with her and the instant they learned of her 1997 death. As RadarOnline.com has learned, the two royals have finally come clean about their grief over Princess Diana‘s death, 20 years after the fatal car crash.
“It’s still raw,” Harry, 32, opened up saying, as he and William flipped through old childhood photos of them with their mom.
Speaking of the love he had for his mother, William said: “I’m grateful that love still feels there.” Harry agreed, saying, “It was that love that even if she was on the other side of a room, as a son you could feel it.”
Heartbreakingly recalling his last phone call with her, Meghan Markle‘s royal boyfriend sadly claimed: “If I’d known that was the last time I’d speak to my mother, the things I would have said to her… looking back on it now it is incredibly hard.”

As Radar readers know, Diana died in a horrific car crash as she was chased by photographers in Paris. Her lover Dodi Al Fayed died with her. Harry and William were with their father in Scotland at the time. Harry was 12 and William was 15.
“I remember just feeling completely numb, disorientated, dizzy,” said William. “You feel very, very confused. And you keep asking yourself ‘Why me?’ All the time, ‘Why, what have I done? Why, why has this happened to us?'”
While the public bashed them for not returning to London immediately after her death, Harry claimed he was very thankful his grandmother put their health before their public image at the time. William agreed, adding: “I think it was a very hard decision for my grandmother to make. She felt very torn between being a grandmother [to him and Harry] and her Queen role.”

They also shared that Queen Elizabeth, 91, used to hide the newspapers from their castle so that William and Harry wouldn’t see the news written about her mother’s shocking death.
“Back then, obviously, there were no smartphones or anything like that, so you couldn’t get your news, and thankfully at the time to be honest, we had the privacy to mourn and collect our thoughts and to have that space away from everybody,” William said. “We had no idea that the reaction to her death would be quite so huge.”
Now, as he raises his own children with Duchess Kate Middleton, 35, William, 35, claimed he tries to talk to George, 4, and Charlotte, 2, about Diana in order to remind them that there were once two grandmothers in their lives.

“We’ve got more photos up around the house now of her and we talk about her… it’s hard because obviously Katherine didn’t know her so she cannot really provide that level of detail,” he said.
Speaking of how difficult it was for him to walk next to his mom’s casket during her funeral at such a young age, Harry previously stated that he didn’t think “any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances. I don’t think it would happen today.” In the documentary, however, he claimed that he was glad he ended up participating and making his mother “proud.”
“Looking back on it now I am very glad I was part of it,” Harry said.

Emily Ratajkowski's "Blurred Lines" Debut Was Because of This Man He photographs some of the most beautiful (and most famous) women and men in the world. Steve Shaw is the founder and creative director of Shaw & Co—a media.../n
He photographs some of the most beautiful (and most famous) women and men in the world.Steve Shaw is the founder and creative director of Shaw & Co—a media company that's home to a number of publications (with one film media outlet on the way, Circus Magazine, launching later this year), but the company is, arguably, the most known for a modern gentleman's magazine that's developed somewhat of a cult following among civilians and celebs alike called Treats! Magazine.In his very first issue was Jason Statham, and since then he's featured the likes of Emily Ratajkowski, Olivia Culpo, Scott Eastwood and so many others. Robin Thickeactually went from being on the magazine's cover to using the publication as a personal casting agency for his wildly popular hit, "Blurred Lines"—hence EmRata's involvement.So clearly, Steve has some wisdom to share.What was your first job?  I left school at 15 and started working in a photo studio that photographed mail order catalogs in Manchester. I was an assistant making tea for everybody, sweeping the floors and cleaning up. I did that for two and a half years, until I was 18, then I started my own business.

How did Treats come to be? Having dealt with so many art directors...you do the shoot, they pick the worst pictures, then they make them smaller and retouch them badly (and on crap paper). So I said to some photographer friends, I'll give you 20 pages, full frame, big format and amazing paper, would you shoot with me for free? They said yes. Most photographers just wanted to shoot girls with no restrictions, no clothes basically. Treats is a fashion magazine just without a ton of fashion in it. One of my closest friends from the UK was visiting me, went into my office one day when I wasn't there and saw all my boxes of film. He's looking at all the photographs and says, "you've shot so many treats." You should do a book with all these girls and call it Treats. That's how it got its name.Who was the first celeb you ever shot for Treats? Jason Statham—he was in the first issue. A mate of mine and I asked if he'd do it and he said yes, which was amazing. He didn't know what the magazine was going to look like. He said they were the best photographs he'd ever had. For a while, I was the only photographer he wanted to work with.Who are your biggest celeb fans? Jennifer Lawrence saw a copy and said she would be in it, and Robin Thicke was a big part of it—also a huge fan.

What's a typical day like for you?Juggling production, photo shoots, lots of emails and, of course, casting beautiful models all day.What's the best part about your career?I get to work with some incredibly talented photographers from around the world. Ones whose work has inspired me.What's the most daring career risk you've taken?Selling my house to create the magazine.Who are your career heroes?Helmut Newton, Tom Ford, Mark Zuckerberg.

What's the best piece of advice you've ever received?My father told me to trust in my instinct & treat others how you would want to be treated (no pun intended).If you could photograph anyone, who would it be?Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. She's the epitome of class, beauty, and intelligence. She's a woman who is dynamic and hysterically funny.

Finish the sentences below.Today for lunch I had…a green juice.The first website I log onto every day is…treatsmagazine.com!The last thing I Googled was…Charles Saatchi.My usual coffee order is…English breakfast tea.If I wasn't doing this job, I'd be…bored.List five things on your desk right now…Manuka honey, bills, a NU Muse calendar, too many business cards and my laptop.The book I'm reading is…Whatever You Think, Think the Opposite by Paul Arden.Issue 12 of Treats! Magazine comes out July 13th, and will also be available on digital copy here with extra pages included.

The View -- Whoopi Goldberg Takes Shot at Barbara Walters During Heated Test Show /nRosie O'Donnell got into a heated showdown over abortion with CNN's S.E. Cupp during a 'View' test show taping with Whoopi Goldberg ... who ended up taking a thinly-veiled shot at Barbara Walters. Production sources at  "The View " tell us Cupp -- who's vying for the conservative role on the show -- had a  "nasty " debate yesterday over the Australian couple making headlines for asking their surrogate to abort a Down syndrome baby.  We're told things escalated when Whoopi jumped in and asked Cupp if she ever had to make a decision about abortion. That shut everyone up momentarily ... until Rosie chastised Cupp, saying she didn't want another Elisabeth Hasselbeck.Here's where Babs comes in. After the taping ... Whoopi -- in front of producers and several potential replacement hosts -- said she'd been  "working with a cranky 85-year-old woman who's mad about everything for 2 years, and I need a break. "Hard to tell who Whoopi was really upset with -- Rosie or Cupp -- but the shot at Barbara was undeniable.As for Cupp ... doesn't sound like she left on Rosie's good side -- but then again ... that may be exactly what  "The View " needs./n
Mel B Sued By Nanny Lorraine Gilles for Defamation/nMel B's former nanny is filing a lawsuit against the singer, claiming she told lies about her in the divorce case against Stephen Belafonte. TMZ has learned the lawsuit centers on declarations Mel B filed in which she claims Belafonte and Lorraine Gilles told her they had an affair and that Lorraine was pregnant with his child. Mel B also claimed Gilles had an abortion. Mel B goes on to accuse Gilles and Belafonte of pilfering money from her. In another declaration, Mel B claims Lorraine has control over her sex tapes and might disseminate them. There are numerous exhibits and pictures in the lawsuit which Gilles believe will convince a jury Mel B's allegations are a pack of lies. It's interesting ... generally a person can't be sued for what they say in court papers, but there's an exception in California family law cases when someone makes a claim against 3rd parties who are not involved in the litigation. Lorraine Gilles is a 3rd party in the divorce case./n
Look Away, Kanye! Kim & Ray J’s Hottest Home Movies Leak/n
Kim Kardashian’s 2007 sex tape is the bestselling of all time, but for years, some of her most intimate moments were locked away and uncovered – until now! Watch Kardashian suck face and get down and dirty with then-boyfriend Ray J in wild home movies uncovered exclusively by RadarOnline.com.
Kardashian and the R&B singer brother of Brandy Norwood filmed their infamous tape during an October 2003 getaway to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.
In these never-before-seen outtakes from the trip, obtained by Radar, there’s plenty of evidence of the fiery chemistry that would make them both millionaires.
Sucking face and groping each other across town in the footage, they openly brag to the camera about their upcoming exploits.
During one dinner, Ray J brags, “The dessert was off the chain and the real dessert is about to really be off the chain.”

“We’ll get to that later, so stay tuned,” Kim giggles to the camera. “Girls gone wild!”
In another clip, she openly grabs Ray J’s crotch as the couple dance in front of a restaurant crowd, prompting an employee to openly joke about her going for his “jewels.”
Later in the evening, their dance-floor makeout session gets so hot, a bystander approaches Ray J and says, “I don’t know you but you’re the man! You’re the luckiest man around.”
Kardashian seems more than comfortable with an audience.
Indeed, despite her later claims insisting that she had nothing to do with the sex tape’s release, Kardashian seems to know that the footage is intended for outside viewers.
PHOTOS: Family Affair! Kim, Kendall & Kylie Bare All In See-Through Lace
Complaining in one shot, “I don’t like the angle I’m in!” Kim laughs as Ray J admits, “I’m putting this on the DVD.”
Four years later, the resulting film would be released by Vivid Entertainment, catapulting Kim and her Keeping Up with the Kardashians family to world superstardom.
Kim and her family have always denied that they had anything to do with the release of the tape. Just weeks ago, mom Kris Jenner called the tape “devastating,” and “one of the most horrific things that we, as a family, went through.”
But in the video, all Kim could think about was her young romance.

Asked what she wanted to record for posterity, she cooed, “I wanna say that I have the best boyfriend in the world who took me to Cabo on my birthday,” later swearing, “I promise on Kendall and Kylie, I will never cheat on Ray J.”
They ultimately broke up in 2006 – amid rumors that both had strayed.

When Bloggers Attack: Top 10 Hated Celebs/nThe folks over at Bumpshack got together with some of their fellow bloggers at Allie is Wired, Celebrity Smack, PopBytes, Nosy Snoop, Hot Momma Drama, Gone Hollywood, and the Pink Meat Companyto put together a  "Top 10 Most Hated Celebs " list. Most hated at least to these bloggers anyway. Celebs with music projects are sprinkled throughout the list.   Paris Hilton, whom many bloggers like myself love to hate, came in at #1. This is an obvious choice. Indeed, they call Ms. Hilton  "Hollywood's most famous slut. " Ouch! Even though it is easy to not like Paris, I find myself coming full circle and bet she'd be fun to hang out with. I'm sure Travis Barker can vouch for that. Right behind her at #2 is her former pal and sometimes singer Lindsay Lohan. Linds is also a likely candidate to be near the top of these kinds of lists. But, unlike Paris she'll get no love from me or from the folks who made the list. They scorch old firecrotch with this zinger:  "At this point, there's really no difference between Lindsay, Paris and one of those 'blow up sex dolls.'  " A crack like that could draw blood from even the biggest of ego. Maybe Lindsay will do a Paris-like, this stuff  "hurts my feelings " confessional.  The Spederlines hit the list with K-Fed at #4 and Brit Brit in 6th. These always astute bloggers hit the nail on the head as to why we hate K-Fed,  "he was smart enough to marry one of the richest and sexiest (at the time) women in the world. Yep, that pretty much sums up why I don't like him. Jessica Simpson and Michael Jackson round out the musical entries on the list by filling the #8 and #10 spots, respectively. The bloggers felt MJ's  "resume " spoke for itself, but did take some time to explain why Jess made the list. Apparently, Nick Lachey is viewed as a good guy and these folks feel Jess blew it with him pointing out that now  "men in Hollywood only want in her Daisy Dukes and not her heart. " Would Bam Magera agree? See the full list here./n
The Royals Recap: Princess Eleanor Gets Caught Between Jasper and Beck While Liam Struggles With His Brother's Return Meanwhile, Liam wasn't prepared to completely cut Kathryn out of his life, especially after she sent him a text a.../n
It's so good to be king, but who is the real one?The palace was abuzz with chaos on Sunday's all-new episode of The Royals as Prince Robert (Max Brown) prepared to make his public debut on the balcony alongside his family after his presumed death. As the country speculated about the transition of power and his future queen, the resurrected monarch attempted to reconnect with his old love, Kathryn (Christina Wolfe), who was still grappling with her feelings for both Robert and Liam (William Moseley).Meanwhile, Princess Eleanor (Alexandra Park) had relationship drama of her own after an arrogant ex-boyfriend strolled back into town and challenged her romance with Jasper (Tom Austen).Keep reading for tonight's recap!

Princess Eleanor received quite the surprise when she was woken up from bed by her old flame Beck (Andrew Cooper), who graciously greeted her with a plate of crispy bacon. Although he was in town to celebrate his best friend's homecoming, he was also eager to rekindle their relationship. However, Eleanor quickly cooled him off with the news of her new boyfriend. He angrily stormed out of her room, but not before Jasper caught him leaving on the security camera!

Meanwhile, Liam wasn't prepared to completely cut Kathryn out of his life, especially after she sent him a text asking to talk. He went over to her apartment where she revealed Robert had messaged her to meet. "We didn't do anything wrong," Liam reassured her. But Kathryn still felt incredibly nervous. "I'm so worried I'm going to say the wrong thing and just mess things up between you two," she admitted. "I don't want to get between brothers." Robert then arrived outside on his motorcycle to whisk her away for a private rendezvous. "I'm sorry," she told Liam as she left.

Queen Helena (Elizabeth Hurley) attempted to coerce King Cyrus (Jake Maskall) into letting Robert have the prime position on the balcony during the public celebration. "Take this moment and secure your legacy as the wise steward who held the royal family together in the terrible months after Simon's death and the return of the rightful heir," Helena advised him. "The only alternative is for you to be the guy who tried, and most definitely failed, to tear this family apart. Robert should stand front and center." Cyrus reluctantly agreed to the queen's wishes. "I see your point," he conceded. "Robbie's great, and it's the right thing to do."Despite that agreement, Cyrus soon after gave an on-camera interview in which he blatantly denied Robert's claim to the throne. "The kid is legally dead, and we're a nation of laws," he said. "Never in the history of this country has a sitting king been dethroned, unless it was on the battlefield. Well then, the battlefield it is." Game on!

Later, Jasper confronted Eleanor about Beck's visit in her bedroom. She promised that she kicked him out and guaranteed him Beck was only back in the palace for Robert. "I told him that I have a boyfriend, but if you like, I can put a lock on my door or perhaps wear a chastity belt?" she joked.But Beck eventually learned from Robert that Jasper was the mystery man who had stolen Eleanor's heart, and once he had that information he decided to fight dirty. "A sir is what I am, my birthright," he told Jasper. "You, on the other hand, what do you have a right to? You're not good enough for her. Don't get above your station."

Robert had taken Kathryn to a secluded area away from the public eye. It was also the location where they shared their first kiss. "I know it wasn't a happy thing being my secret," he told her, confessing, "I had a lot of time to think when I was away, time to really understand what matters, imagining days like this. It really helped me to get through it all. I don't know if you're seeing anyone, and I don't have any right to ask you, but I bloody well missed you, Kay."Liam went back to visit Kathryn after her date with Robert. They both agreed he needed to know the truth. Liam thought it would be best coming from him. "No matter the fallout, it should be me that tells him, brother to brother," he said. "The sooner, the better."

When Eleanor found out about Beck's insult toward Jasper, she immediately defended her man's honor. "Class isn't about who you are, Beck," she said. "It's about how you act. All of this means nothing without the behavior to back it up. Have some grace, a--hole!"Nevertheless, Jasper was still feeling insecure. "I'm not too good for you, I am perfect for you," Eleanor told him. "And, you are for me. So, get all those other voices out of your head and listen to me." She also decided to give him inspiration for his next love letter with a sexy striptease in the throne room.

Helena was stressed out over Cyrus' refusal to cooperate, so Robert came up with his own plan to smooth things over and move forward without drama. "With father gone and Lucius too, I was hoping for some guidance from you," he told his uncle. "This is a highly unusual situation, and I don't have experience in such matters. I genuinely value your opinion."Cyrus suggested they let the courts decide who should be king, and Robert agreed if it could be kept private. Robert later gloated to Helena that he had persuaded Cyrus into a privy council by making him think it was all his idea. "I have faith in England," he said. "And more importantly, I have faith in you, mother."

Liam was almost at his breaking point as the family prepared to take the balcony together. He was still dealing with being pushed back into his brother's shadow, and now he also had to come clean about his relationship with Kathryn. As he knocked back another gulp from his flask, Beck came over to taunt Jasper once more. "Maybe address his royal highness as such next time," he scolded. "Know your place."Liam overheard and finally lost it. He charged at Beck and tackled him to the ground before Jasper had a chance to intervene. As soon as the scuffle was broken up, Robert pulled Liam aside. "I don't know what Beck said or did to deserve that, but he is not my brother. You are," he said. "So, what can I do for you, brother? Do you not want to go out there? Should I tell them that you're ill?"

"No, I can do this," Liam replied. "It's what I was born to do."

Nicholas Sparks -- Sued By School Headmaster -- He's A Racist, Homophobic, Anti-Semite/nScott Schwimer, Sparks' entertainment lawyer, tells TMZ, “As a gay, Jewish man who has represented Nick for almost 20 years I find these allegations completely ludicrous and offensive.” Sparks' lawyer for this case, Theresa Sprain, adds,  "We deny these allegations. " Nicholas Sparks ﻿is a homophobic, anti-Semitic racist who ironically also disrespects Alzheimer's patients ... according to the Jewish ex-headmaster of Sparks' Christian school.Saul Hillel Benjamin claims in a new lawsuit -- obtained by TMZ -- he was hired to run the Epiphany School for Global Studies founded by Sparks in 2006.Benjamin says he began complaining to the author of  "The Notebook " and others ... the school had virtually no African Americans -- 2 out of 514 students.  Benjamin claims Sparks responded,  "Black students are too poor and can't do the academic work. "  Benjamin also says Sparks got incensed when he [Benjamin] met with the NAACP North Carolina chapter, telling the headmaster to  "engage only in private and less visible contact with African Americans. " The lawsuit goes on ... claiming Sparks ignored bullying claims by gay students and even lent support to a student group that wanted to enact a  "homo-caust.

Here Are The 35 Questions Taylor Swift's Potential Jurors Had To Answer In Court/n

Was there an assault or not? This is the question at the center of Taylor Swift's trial.
Back in 2015, radio host David Mueller sued the singer claiming he lost his job when, he says, her security team wrongfully accused him of groping her at a 2013 meet-and-greet backstage at the Pepsi Center in Denver.
Related: Taylor & Joe Alwyn Hide From The Paparazzi!
A month later, the Love Story musician countersued, claiming he "intentionally reached under her skirt, and groped with his hand an intimate part of her body in an inappropriate manner, against her will, and without her permission."
Fast forward to Monday, jury selection for the trial began where all parties including Swift — dressed in a white dress and black jacket — were in attendance. According to the Associated Press, the DJ had his "back turned to Swift, who sat at a nearby table with her mother, Andrea Swift, and their attorney."
Awk-warrrrrrrrd.
A total of eight jurors will be selected from a pool of 60, and each were asked 35 questions, focusing on whether they are fans of Swift and whether they saw the photo of Mueller and the now-27-year-old. Each side believes the snap will determine if an inappropriate touch occurred.

Paranoid George Clooney Hires Newborn Twins Their Own Bodyguards/n
George Clooney is willing to pay anything for every security measure possible to protect his and Amal‘s newborn twins, Alexander and Ella . Find out how far the actor has gone to ensure nothing will ever happen to them.
According to the Daily Star, George is writing one check after another to amp up security at his $15 million-dollar mansion in Sonning, Berks.
So much so that the 56-year-old has hired each of the twins’ their own bodyguards to follow their every move — inside and outside the house. The new “baby bouncers”, who were even ordered to stand guard in the nursery, are reportedly costing the couple over $318,000 a year.

“Fatherhood was a long time coming for George so he’s not risking his brood coming to any harm,” a source told the publication. “The baby bouncers are just the start.”
Insiders also revealed that the Ocean’s 11 star demanded a $127,000 security system be set up that has a web of lasers covering their property.
“He and Amal have really spoiled the twins,” the source added. “There’s been so much work done on the house already for them.”

However, Clooney’s reasons to fear danger for their new family members may have merit since his attorney wife has been the focus of terrorists threats for years due to her increased visibility.
During an interview in February, Clooney admitted how Amal’s career will change now that they have children.
“We decided to be much more responsible , to avoid danger,” he told the French magazine Paris Match. “I won’t go to south Sudan anymore or the Congo, Amal will no longer go to Iraq and she’ll avoid places where she knows she isn’t welcome.”

Bobby Brown Asks Media to Not Speak With ‘Unauthorized Members of the Family’/n

Bobb Kristina's aunt Leolah Brown claims she's doing "just fine" and even opening her eyes

Bobby Brown, father of  Bobbi Kristina Brown, issued a new statement to the media yesterday (Feb. 13, 2015), regarding the updates being distributed from family sources.
He called out family sources, in particular Jerod Brown, for providing unreliable information to the media, and asks that they not be believed.
Ever since Brown was found facedown and unresponsive in her bathtub 2 weeks ago (Jan. 31, 2015), several “sources” have spoken to the media, but those reports have either been conflicting or, now we know, inaccurate.

Bobby Brown’s lawyer Christopher Brown issued a statement saying,
At this time it is requested that the media cease speaking with unauthorized members of the family. The integrity of the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina must remain uncompromised.
Various members of the family have provided media interviews, however, none of them are approved visitors to see Bobbi Kristina.
None of them have firsthand knowledge of Bobbi Kristina’s treatment and the medical staff at Emory University Hospital has not communicated with them.
In particularly [sic], Jerod Brown aka Jerod Carter aka YF Kennedy, continues to makes statements and appear on television, however, he has not had any communication with Bobby Brown or the Houston family. He must be disregarded.
Please do not attend any ‘meet and greet’ organized by Jerod Brown as he is unable to provide access to Bobbi Kristina or information on her condition. This is a criminal investigation and we do not need this side show.
Bobby Brown then added, “We continue to request privacy in this matter. We thank everyone that supports Bobbi Kristina and God is hearing our prayers.”

Bobbi Kristina Brown has remained on life-support for nearly two weeks since her drowning incident. Brown is holding on to hope that his 21-year-old daughter (with late ex-wife and legend Whitney Houston) will recover, however her condition has remained unchanged and she remains unconscious.
Nick Gordon, Bobbi Kristina’s partner who was previously believed to be her husband, has also spoken out amidst Jerod Brown’s statements that he was barred from the hospital from the family.
According to People, his lawyer said, “In response to reports that Nick Gordon is taking legal action, he would like it to be clear, he is not. Mr. Gordon’s only concern is the recovery of Bobbi Kristina. He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon.
“Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.”
Gordan reportedly is at the center of the criminal investigation of that Saturday morning when Brown was found unresponsive in the bathtub.

Kris Jenner Gets Dragged for Knowing Nothing About the ACLU/n

WTF happened?!

On a night when so many things went wrong, Kris Jenner added the cherry to the shitstorm sundae that is the 2017 Academy Awards by publicly proclaiming her ignorance on live television.

While giving her fashion commentary during E!’s red carpet coverage on Sunday night (Feb. 26, 2017), Jenner let it be known she knew nothing about the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization that advocates human rights and is currently working overtime in the face of President Donald Trump’s Muslim ban, when she questioned the blue ribbons many celebrities were wearing in support of the non-profit.
Giving her critique of Oscar nominee Ruth Negga’s red Valentino gown, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star quipped, “What is the little blue thing she has there?”

— Lizzy Kahn (@lizzkahn) February 27, 2017

“This is the first one I’ve seen,” Jenner remarked after host Giuliana Rancic explained to her its meaning and directed her an article about the pin.
The momager was then promptly dragged by Twitter for, well, not reading up on current events that affect many minorities in America.

Rancic, who experienced backlash in the past for ignorantly presuming that Zendaya smelled of Pachouli oil for wearing dreadlocks on the red carpet, was also roasted for blasé and dumbed down explanation.
“It’s all about um, human rights.” Giuliani Rancic could not say more than 2 words about the ACLU ribbon to a clueless Kris Jenner. #Oscars

Giuliana Rancic trying to explain the ACLU blue ribbons at the Oscars to Kris Jenner: “it’s about people’s rights and stuff.” Ohhhhhh 💔
— Molly Hirschbeck (@MollyHirschbeck) February 27, 2017


The ACLU’s official Twitter account even responded to Jenner’s comment, writing,”It’s a ribbon that says you stand for people’s rights, @krisjenner!”
A source later told Radar Online that Jenner “absolutely flipped out when the cameras stopped rolling,” saying, “Kris accused producers of trying to sabotage her. She actually went on to say that it was their fault that they did not inform her of what the blue ribbons signified.”
Aside from Negga, celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Karlie Kloss, Busy Philipps and Moonlight director Barry Jenkins were seen sporting an ACLU ribbon at the awards ceremony. At an Oscars after-party, newly-minted Academy Award winner Emma Stone was also spotted with a blue pin on her second outfit of the night (she was previously wearing a small gold Planned Parenthood badge on her Givenchy gown).

Mad Madge! Madonna Throws Daughter Mercy The Bday Bash From Hell/n
Sleepyhead Madonna went to bed during her daughter’s weekend-long birthday party — leaving angry guests on their own to feed themselves, an insider told RadarOnline.com.
The Material Girl, 58, invited friends to her Hamptons estate for a sleepover to celebrate adopted daughter Mercy turning 11, a guest told Radar.
But before long, the source said, Madonna disappeared into her bedroom — and let her guests go hungry while the children blasted “unruly” music!

Finally, at 9:45 p.m. on the second night of the sleepover, a guest stormed up to Madonna’s bedroom.
“My daughter’s starving! Those kid’s downstairs are starving! And the chef tells me he only takes orders from the lady of the house!” the guest shouted, according to our spy.

Within minutes, Madonna ordered up dinner — but her French Caribbean chef served a kosher meal that “was horrible,” the guest claimed.
In the end, several parents took their children to a local diner!

Former Mexican President Drops The F-BOMB On CNN Over Trump's Fucking Wall — Watch!/n

This week, it was revealed that Donald Trump had a tense phone call with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto back in January over — what else? — who would pay for his stupid wall.
According to leaked transcripts, Nieto stood firm that Mexico wouldn't be footing the bill for Trump's golden campaign promise, which caused President Manchild to beg and whine like a little baby.
Well, Trump's lucky he wasn't speaking with Nieto's predecessor, who would have been a LOT more forceful in refusing to pay for the border barrier.

Vicente Fox made his thoughts about Trump's "fucking wall" clear once the phone call was made — but now that the conversation has reached the public eye, the former president of Mexico felt the need to reiterate his colorful words.
During an interview with CNN on Friday, host Alisyn Camerota asked Fox whether Nieto was forceful enough on the matter — to which he bluntly replied: 
"Well you could use my words, ‘We'll never pay for that fucking wall.' That makes it more clear."
Ha! They definitely heard him loud and clear on the CNN set.
Related: Anthony Scaramucci Audio Released!
Fox continued to explain that Mexico paying for the wall made no political sense, and just showcased Trump's dishonesty (and/or stupidity). He added:
"But it's still who can think about a country paying for a wall that is going to be built in the neighbor's territory. Why should Mexico pay for the wall? What's the reason? We don't need a wall. If Trump wants to build a wall he has to go to Congress and he has to tell the truth to U.S. taxpayers that they're going to pay for that."
*Sigh* Just add it to the fucking list…
Watch Fox shock CNN with his expletive-filled response (below).

UPDATE 2:06 pm et-
Simpson addressed the panel one final time, asking to be given parole.

____________
UPDATE 1:47 pm et –

He continued, saying: “I’m not trying to make an excuse now. They were there because of me [about the armed men.]”
Simpson angrily defended himself, saying: “I’m no danger of pulling a gun on anybody. I never have in my life. I never have been accused of it. Nobody has ever accused me of pulling any weapon on them. Bruce knows I would never do that. I never have.”
____________
UPDATE 1:12 pm et-
Simpson spoke for the first time, telling the parole board why he decided to rob the men at gunpoint and steal the memorabilia.

The disgraced football star is appearing before the Nevada Board of Parole via satellite from the Lovelock Prison on Thursday, July 20, 2017 at 1 P.M. ET asking to be released from lockup after serving nine years behind bars and RadarOnline.com will be livestreaming the proceedings.
Orenthal James Simpson was arrested in 2007 for felony armed robbery and kidnapping after he and group of men stole some of his sport memorabilia at gunpoint in a Las Vegas hotel room. He was found guilty and sentenced to 33 years in prison in 2008, with the possibility of parole in nine years.

Inmate No. 1027820 at Lovelock Correctional Facility in Nevada will have a hearing on Thursday and the four-member board will deliberate in private and then vote in public if he should be released from prison.
The only people allowed to speak during the hearing will be victims, direct family members of victims, Simpson, and his representatives.
The four members must unanimously agree to release Simpson and if they do he could be set free from prison in October, 22 years after being found not guilty for the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.

O.J.’s late ex-wife and Ronald were found brutally slaughtered outside Nicole’s Brentwood condo, with her head almost completely severed from her body. The Juice was arrested and tried for the murders but a Los Angeles jury found him not guilty after a 10 ½ month trial on October 3, 1995.
The former USC football star was defended by a legal dream team including Robert Kardashian and Johnny Cochran, who stunned the country when he had Simpson try on the gloves the prosecutor claimed he was wearing when he killed Brown Simpson and Goldman. Simpson couldn’t get them on, saying “they don’t fit,” and Cochran told the jury “if the gloves don’t fit, you must acquit.”
Simpson’s parole board hearing cameras will begin to broadcast at 12 noon E.T. and Radar will be livestreaming the proceedings.

Warning! Spoilers ahead!

The documentary is over and the reality show has begun on this season of American Horror Story but the plot twists and grisly deaths show no signs of stopping. After all, we learned last week that all the house’s visitors die, except one before it’s all over.
Not long after Rory (Evan Peters) was stabbed to death by the spirits of the murderous nurses, Sidney (Cheyenne Jackson) and his crew are attacked by Agnes (Kathy Bates), in full-Butcher mode. Honestly, she pretty much dominates this episode.

We soon learned that Dominic (Cuba Gooding Jr.) really returned to the haunted house to serve as the cast’s antagonist and is planning to record his misdeeds with a hidden body-cam.
What really set this installment in motion was Agnes’ attack on Shelby (Lily Rabe), prompting Lee (Adina Porter), Audrey (Sarah Paulson) and Monet’s (Angela Bassett) excursion to find help. But just about everything that could go wrong did, including an appearance from the pig man, the revelation of Sidney and Rory’s deaths, oh, and another attack from Agnes and her giant cleaver.
The trio of women land in the home of he pot-growing Polks who are indeed cannibals. Like in the documentary, Audrey and Monet are forced to eat bits of their friend.
Back at the house, we learn that Matt (Andre Holland) only returned to the Roanoke home to see the Wood Witch (Lady Gaga) again, who he confesses to love before getting bludgeoned to death by his estranged wife. As Dominic and Shelby attempt to come up with a plan, Agnes shows up outside raving like the Butcher…that is until the real Butcher (Susan Berger) shows up with her ghostly band of colonists.

Before the actual Butcher sinks her own cleaver in the devout impostor’s head, Agnes cowers and says, “I’m sorry, I just wanted to be on TV.”
Will this low-key critique of reality TV continue as this season wraps up? And now that we know Bates isn’t the season’s baddie, does that honor fall to Berger? Or is another insidious villain still waiting in the wing?
Until next week!

 Woman Claims Fox Host Eric Bolling Sexually Harassed Her: He Called Me 'Dr. McHottie'.../n
In a lengthy post, former Fox guest Caroline Heldman claimed she was sexually harassed by now-suspended host Eric Bolling, RadarOnline.com can report.
44-year-old Associate Professor of Politics at Occidental College in Los Angeles said that while she made “hundreds” of appearance on Fox between years 2008 and 2011, Bolling constantly made advances on her, both on and off air.
As Radar reported, Bolling, 54, was suspended last week from his co-hosting role on The Specialists for allegedly sending photos of his genitals to various female colleagues.

“My only surprise is that it took this long for people to come forward about Bolling’s behavior, which has been wildly inappropriate for years,” wrote Heldman.
She then stated that Bolling often called and texted her after shows to talk or to apologize for his behavior on camera, only to do it again after her next appearance.
During one appearance in 2011, the host referred to her as “the great Dr. McHottie.”
Said Heldman, “I pushed back with ‘Mr. McSexist,’ but I shouldn’t have had to. This on-air behavior was perfectly acceptable to Fox executives at the time.”

Heldman stated that he once offered to fly her to New York to “have fun,” and that the one time she agreed to see his office, he immediately told her it was his favorite place to have sex.
In her post, Heldman added that she was not the first woman to receive such inappropriate behavior from him.
“There are a lot of great people working at Fox, many of whom I admire and respect to this day, but there is also a culture of sexual harassment that has not fully been addressed,” said Heldman. “I have faith that, given recent decisions to fire and suspend perpetrators, the new management will effectively shift this culture.”

Bolling denied all claims of his relationship with Heldman, as his attorney Michael Bowe told DailyMail.com on Monday: “Mr. Bolling never had any interactions with Ms. Heldman of a sexual nature, and any such accusation would be false and defamatory.”
A Fox News spokesperson told Radar in a statement: “Eric Bolling has been suspended pending the results of an investigation, which is currently underway.” In regards to the alleged incident with Heldman, the network added, “We are investigating this matter and all claims will be taken into account.”
Heldman previously accused producer Woody Fraser, 82, of pressuring her into sex. He too denied the accusations.

 D.C. Murder Suspect 'Feels He Was Definitely Set Up,' Lawyer Says –– Shocking New.../n
The suspect in last month’s murder of a Washington D.C. family and their housekeeper thinks he was framed, according to his new attorney.
Sean Hanover, who began representing Daron Wint this past weekend in the May 14 deaths of Savvas, Amy and Philip Savopoulos, and Vera Figueroa, told ABC affiliate WJLA that his client feels like others have made him the fall guy in the gruesome deaths.
“I think it’s fair to say that he feels at this time that he was definitely set up,” the attorney said, adding that Wint, who could be deported if convicted, “believes that once people begin to understand who else was out there and what was going on, they’re going to see him in a very different light.”

Hanover was hired by Wint’s family Saturday and represented him during a Tuesday hearing. He said a full survey of the DNA evidence at the scene is crucial in the case, after Wint’s DNA was picked up off a pizza crust, leading to his arrest.
“We don’t know what other DNA evidence exists — we’ve only learned thus far about the pizza — let’s see what else is there,” he said.

After Tuesday’s hearing, Hanover said Wint was “encouraged about the case” and “feels good that justice will be served.”
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Wint, who once worked for Savvas Savopoulos, has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of the four victims, whose bodies were found in the family mansion that was later set ablaze. Authorities have said that they do not believe Wint acted on his own in the gruesome crime.
The case returns to court July 2. /n
Madonna Turns 3.3 Miley's Old/nAdmit it, two things you never thought would happen -- Madonna turning 50, and her celebrating the cherished moment with husbore, Guy Ritchie. Our spies were inside Madge's half-century soiree last night at Volstead, a private party nightclub in London's west end. They say about 90 people showed up for Madge's surprise party -- and she was actually surprised -- including her three kids (who came in through the back). Thousands of red roses were everywhere, her table had a caviar-filled crystal ball on it, and sushi, quail eggs, watermelon martinis and giant bottles of Krug Rose champagne were served.At one point Guy stood up and gave a lovey-dovey speech about her. Madonna followed (refusing a mic because it was too impersonal), and spoke about how much she loved her loyal friends -- then went on a diatribe about Kabbalah that made people lose interest. Imagine that. The shin dig lasted until 3 AM.  See Also      Happy Botoxday to You, Madge      Keizer vs Madge      Madge Ghost Writes The Whip/n
Billy Bush Talks Tape Scandal For The First Time: 'I Wish I Had Changed The Topic'/n
Billy Bush has spoken out for the first time about the controversial Access Hollywood tape with Donald Trump, which ultimately got him axed from his TODAY show slot as Trump rose to become the country’s new president.
“I will admit the irony is glaring. [Trump] has his process for his participation [in the tape], and I have mine. I had to turn this into a positive,” he confessed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday.
PHOTOS: Sorry, Not Sorry? Billy Bush STILL Hasn’t Apologized To Nancy O’Dell
The disgraced TV host added that he wished he tried to change the subject when Trump began saying he could “do anything” to women as a famous star, even “grab’em by the p***y.”
“Looking back on what was said on that bus, I wish I had changed the topic. I wish I had said: ‘Does anyone want water?’ or ‘It looks like it’s gonna rain.’ He liked TV and competition. I could’ve said, ‘Can you believe the ratings on whatever?’ I didn’t have the strength of character to do it.”
Later, Bush threw Trump under the bus, slamming the prez’s excuse of “locker room talk.”

“I’m in a lot of locker rooms, I am an athlete, and no, that is not the type of conversation that goes on or that I’ve participated in,” Bush told the publication.
When asked if he’d heard from Trump in the wake of the scandal, Bush said no.
“I don’t think I’d interview Trump. It would be a spectacle,” he said of the possibility of another one-on-one with Trump. “In television, we love a spectacle, but I’ve come too far and learned too much. There are others that I’d rather interview, like Emmanuel Macron of France.”

 Babs Behind Bars? Jenelle Evans Calls Cops On Her Mom For Drinking While Watching Son.../n
.



Radar told you first! In a sneak peek for this week’s Teen Mom 2, Jenelle Evans called the police on her mother when she feared she was passed out drunk while watching her son. RadarOnline.com exclusively broke the news of the incident in June.
In the clip, Jenelle’s mother Barbara Evans refused to let her see her son Jace on Cinco de Mayo because she had plans with her friends.
“When David [Eason] was inside he saw her drinking wine and David took pictures from far away,” Jenelle, 25, explained to a producer. “I went in there and I was like, ‘Hey you were drinking and now you’re about to drive’ and she’s like, ‘I had one sip of my wine they just put it on the table.’ I was like, ‘That’s drinking!”
When Jenelle went to her house to confront her again, she didn’t answer the door.

“I ended up calling the police when I was there,” she explained. “The police came and I was like, ‘I don’t know if my mom is passed out and the kids are there. He knocks on the door, she opens it and says, ‘I don’t want her on my property!”
Although the police report obtained by Radar is from May 12, the incident is similar.
“We received a call that there was concern about the welfare of the children in the home,” Boiling Springs Lakes Chief Brad Shirley told Radar at the time.
He added that “an estranged time for visitation with Jenelle’s son” caused the fight.

Barbara explained to Radar, “Jace did not want to go with her. I told Jace and another grandchild to just hide in the house. She came over and banged on my garage and windows for a full hour. She was going ballistic. I thought, ‘Jesus Christ, she’s going to break my windows.’”
Jenelle then called the police. When they arrived around 8:30 p.m., Barbara told her to get off her property.
“We made contact with Grandma immediately and determined this was a civil matter and that the concerns needed to be taken to the judge,” Shirley told Radar. “This was nothing law enforcement needs to get involved with, it was a custody dispute.”

I lost like thirty-some pounds already."As for how much baby weight she gained, she confessed, "I was 202 pounds when I had my son. But I'm tall, so it didn't look like it."Speaking of weight, Rose says three-month old Sebastian is "Fat! He's a little fat boy. He's a little munchie."Daddy Wiz says their little one "dances a lot." "I played him his voice back the other day and he heard it and he started smiling," Wiz added. "He's full of himself."So are more kids in the couple's future?

Looks Like The First Lady Of Japan Pretended Not To Know English So She Wouldn't Have To Talk To Donald Trump!/n

Hahahaha… hahaha.
Reports are surfacing on Thursday suggesting the First Lady of Japan, Akie Abe, pretended not to know English so that she wouldn't have to engage in conversation with Donald Trump! We can't say we blame her, if true!
Let's back up.
In a new interview with The New York Times, POTUS told Maggie Haberman that he had a bit of an awkward dinner at this year's G20 summit in Hamburg because he was seated next to Mrs. Abe for hours, and she "doesn't speak English."
In fact, Donald said she doesn't even know how to say "hello"!

But, thankfully for the Internet, we have proof that Akie not only knows English, but she's extremely well-versed!
Here she is giving a keynote address at the High-Level Symposium on Coastal Resilience a few years ago (below): 



This is truly just brilliant! We're fans!

Michael Phelps put his best fin foot forward, but he's still in a bit of hot water. The most decorated Olympian of all time faced his greatest challenge yet when he decided to race three different sharks in honor of Shark Week. For the Discovery Channel special Phelps vs Shark: Great Gold vs Great White aired on Sunday, the 32-year-old gold medalist traded in a pool for the colder coast of Cape Town, South Africa to test his award-winning speed. In order to more fairly compete with the sea creatures, Phelps swam with a monofin, which would help him simulate the style of a shark. While they did try to level the racing field as much as possible, viewers took issue with the fact that the athlete wasn't actually racing next to the sharks. As had been revealed prior to the special, Phelps would face off against sharks superimposed next to him with the help of CGI technology.  "Clearly, we can't put Michael in one lane and a shark in the far lane. We have to do simulation," Dr. Tristan Guttridge explained. "We'll use our speed data that we've [collected] in all our testing."

So, how did those speeds compare? He managed to swim 50 meters in 18.7 seconds, outpacing the reef shark by 0.2 seconds, but trailing behind the hammerhead, who finished in 15.1 seconds. As for the great white, in a 100-meter race, Phelps finished only two seconds behind and, at times, was swimming faster. However, the cold proved to be almost as challenging as the shark itself. "Before I dove in, I knew how cold it was going to be, and I knew that for me, as a swimmer, we don't swim in this, and it basically just shocked your entire body," he said. "I have this little tiny wetsuit on, so it's absolutely freezing."

Despite his impressive performance, fans honed in on the fact that Phelps was racing his opponents from across an ocean. "THERE'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A SHARK NEXT TO HIM I QUIT IT'S ALL BEEN A LIE," one viewer quipped on Twitter. "Call me crazy but I thought they were gonna put Phelps up against a real shark not a simulation. I feel robbed," another remarked. Nevertheless, while Phelps usually goes for the gold, we'd say silver is just as impressive—especially when up against a great white. Meanwhile, after the reactions on social media, the Discovery Channel released the following statement:"In PHELPS VS SHARK we enlisted world class scientists to take up the challenge of making the world's greatest swimmer competitive with a Great White. The show took smart science and technology to make the challenge more accessible and fun. All the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn't a side by side race. During Michael's pre-show promotion, as well as within the first 2 minutes of PHELPS VS SHARK, this message was clear and we are thrilled with the audience and the engagement around the world."

Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie Are Never, Ever Getting Back Together!/n

Searching for any reason to believe that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie could somehow save their marriage?
Then you were probably thrilled when recent reports suggested the two had put their divorce on hold and were trying to reboot their relationship! But alas, it looks like the Brangelina train is heading full speed to Divorceville and there's no turning back!
Video: Is Angelina Still Interesting To You?
Sources connected to the couple tell TMZ that the divorce is forthcoming, as both sides are hashing out child custody and property settlements.
The insiders said the reconciliation rumors were completely fabricated — specifically the false claims that Brad cleaned up his drinking problem to impress Angie.
In actuality, it's reported the War Machine star made an effort to get clean so he could  get joint custody of his kids!
The image rehabilitation came after the Maleficent actress made damaging allegations against Brad, claiming he was abusive to their kids — another reason why the two aren't looking to reconcile.
R.I.P. forever, you beautiful power couple.

'Big Brother' Winner Mike 'Boogie' Malin LOSES Extortion Case /n "Big Brother " winner Mike 'Boogie' Malin got voted out by a California appeals court, which just ruled his claim that a business partner and her lawyer tried extorting him was ridiculous.Shereen Arazm sued her former business partners Boogie and Lonnie Moore, claiming they siphoned money away from their restaurant, Geisha House.  Before filing the lawsuit, Arazm's lawyer, pit bull Marty Singer sent Boogie a demand letter, essentially saying if they didn't ante up quickly ... all the sordid details would surface in a suit.Boogie sued Singer for extortion, but today the California Court of Appeals scoffed at the claim and threw it out.  The court said Singer's letter was par for the course in lawsuits -- making a claim to settle, or else.Bottom line -- Boogie's extortion claim was bogus.  Boogie also accused Singer of illegal wiretapping and computer hacking.  Those accusations remain part of the ongoing case./n
'Iron Man' -- One Good Suit Deserves Another/nRobert Downey, Jr.'s   "Iron Man " suit was a shameless copy, kind of like a designer ripping off a Vera Wang wedding dress ... so claim 2 guys who now say Marvel and Disney jacked their suit.  Artists Ben and Ray Lai claim in a new lawsuit they came up with a design in 2001 depicting a  "futuristic, armored, and weaponized " body suit and featured it in their  "Radix " comic book. The following year they say Marvel hired them to work on various comics.   The Lai's point out ... the original  "Iron Man " suits from the comics -- created in 1963 -- were simple spandex that had minimal armor. But fast forward to 2008, when the first  "Iron Man " movie was released ... they say Robert Downey. Jr.'s suit was a dead ringer for theirs. And they say to add insult to injury, Marvel used almost the exact same pose from their book for the  "Iron Man " 2 and 3 posters. They're suing Marvel, Disney and others ... and they want all profits attributable to their design./n
Diana Overheard Dirty Prince Charles' Phone Sex With Camilla/n
Princess Diana overheard Prince Charles having dirty phone sex with his longtime mistress Camilla Parker Bowles before Di’s tragic death.
And incredibly, she said her then-husband, the heir to the British throne, was sitting on the toilet while talking to Camilla!
That’s the shocking new revelation marking the 20th anniversary this month of Diana’s death in 1997 in a Paris car wreck.
PHOTOS: The Royal Family Revealed: Secrets William, Kate & Harry Don’t Want You To Know
According to The Sun, in footage filmed five months before Di’s death, in March 1997, a BBC cameraman heard Di’s allegations about Charles—and is only now disclosing what he wrote in his diary about it.
In seven interview sessions, Diana reportedly explained how she caught Charles speaking with Camilla and claimed Camilla was the “raunchier of the two.”
The unidentified cameraman, whom Diana had summoned to the Palace, kept a diary of the recordings in which he wrote: “She caught Charles and Camilla de flagrante after listening in to his phone calls.
PHOTOS: Prince William Taking Paternity Leave And 24 Other Things You Didn’t Know About The Royal Birth
“In one, Charles was sitting on the toilet seat when she caught him.”
In another shocker, Diana said she “would do everything possible to make sure Charles never became King.”
The cameraman allegedly had noted of her oldest son, “She wanted William to succeed to the throne when the Queen died. Diana clearly saw her role as the power behind William.
PHOTOS: Kate Middleton–From Sexy To Sophisticated
“She had this somewhat romantic idea of being a king-maker, the mother behind the monarch.”
But it wasn’t to be. Princess Diana’s stunning death at age 36 on August 31, 1997 is being marked by a slew of TV specials, as Radar has reported.
New death anniversary bombshells have included Diana in tapes saying that Charles only wanted sex once every three weeks during their troubled marriage that she believed was ruined by Camilla.
In 2005, the Prince finally married his longtime mistress Camilla after years of not being able to quit her.

Oh, and she's also famous for this.
And this.
…And this.
Bye bye, Stacey!!!
As for Will, he was a longtime ABC pundit and has been a conservative columnist for decades, before he moved over to FOX News in 2013.
Now, Will is gone at the network, too — and perhaps it's no accident considering The Donald tweeted this about him a few months ago (below): 

George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2016
Hmmm…
Rollins is also gone from the network — he had been a long-time Republican strategist and was the most sane of this bunch of un-renewed contributors… which may not be saying very much.
In their places, FOX has handed out a contributor contract to former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, Nigel Farage.
And yes, Farage is the guy behind Brexit. Heckuva job there, FOX News!
But seriously, Stacey, good riddance!!!

 Chicago Academic’s Dead Body Found In Trunk Of Bali Cabbie, Teen Daughter & Boyfriend.../n
Tommy Schaefer and Heather Mack Friday were charged in Bali, Indonesia in connection with the murder of Mack’s mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack, after the woman’s half-naked remains were recovered from a blood-soaked suitcase in a taxi parked in front of the St. Regis Bali Resort earlier this week.
The couple was officially charged two days after they were taken into custody as suspects in the gruesome killing, Bali deputy police chief Brig. Gen. Gusti Ngurah Raharja Subyakta said, noting that authorities decided to do so after a review of the crime scene, as well as interviews with eyewitnesses.
Officials said that 18-year-old Mack and 21-year-old Schaefer called the cab, stuffed the suitcase containing the dead body in the trunk, and entered the hotel, falsely telling the driver they’d be back. After hotel staffers noticed blood leaking from the suitcase, they directed the cab driver to the police, where the chilling discovery was made.

The couple told authorities that a gang had killed von Wiese Mack, then took them hostage for a prolonged period before breaking free, according to Denpasar Col. Djoko Hari Utomo, adding that neither hotel staffers or the cab driver corroborated their alibi.
The Indonesian defense attorney appointed to oversee the couple, Haposan Sihombing, said Mack or Schaefer “were not cooperative” and did “not respond to many questions” in their interrogation.
As we previously reported, von Wiese Mack was a prominent name in the Chicago academic community who once worked with the late Ted Kennedy. Back in the Windy City, where all three lived, authorities have uncovered more than 86 documented incidents of strife between the mother and daughter from 2004 until 2013. The mother and daughter were seen on hotel security camera in Bali arguing in the lobby of their hotel, authorities said.

Ida Bagus Putu Alit, Denpasar’s coroner, said that results of an external exam on the late woman’s body indicated a violent struggle between von Wiese Mack and her assailants.
“We found scars on both forearms and the broken left-hand fingernail,” Alit said. “That indicated a resistance in a fight.”
In Indonesia, a murder conviction could lead to the death penalty, via a firing squad. /n

 Rachael Ray's Brother Defends Her For Missing Aunt's Funeral To Work, Insists.../n
When Rachael Ray‘s family gathered in upstate New York on December 5 for the funeral of her tragically deceased aunt, Geraldine Scuderi, the TV chef was miles away, filming her show in NYC.
But now, Rachael’s brother, Emmanuel “Manny” Ray is speaking out exclusively to RadarOnline.com to defend his sister’s actions, insisting: “She works very hard.”
Manny was at Scuderi’s wake and funeral in Ticonderoga, NY, last week, and tells Radar, “There was no one that was upset” that his famous sister skipped the ceremonies due to prior work commitments.
“It’s sad that Rachael’s getting dragged into this when she really has nothing to do with it,” Manny says. “She works very hard, and not only does she work for herself, but everyone she cares about. The people that work for her, the people around her, including [Geraldine’s] family. She’s been very good to them and I’m sorry they’ve decided to degrade it for this.”

The Rays’ cousin and Scuderi’s daughter, Gina Mesnick, told the National ENQUIRER that she blamed the Ray family for her mother’s death, and said she doubted Rachael had “shed a single tear” over Scuderi’s death.
Manny says of the family drama, “It’s touchy. I know that Gina is the one who kind of sparked this whole thing. It’s upsetting.”
“There were actually apologies made to us from certain people at the funeral [for the public backlash],” he reveals.

Still, Manny says, “We love them dearly, and this is just one of those things that families go through.”
Scuderi died on the day after Thanksgiving while house-sitting at Rachael’s mom’s house in upstate New York. Mesnick told the ENQUIRER, who first reported the story, that her mother went outside to feed the birds in the late afternoon and couldn’t get back inside the locked home. After hours in the freezing temperatures, her body was found in the driveway the next day. /n
WATCH: Here’s the Alternate ‘Sex and the City’ Opening Credits You’ve Never Seen Before/n





                    Sarah Jessica Parker Says She Would 'Love' to do 'Hocus Pocus 2' and 'Sex and the City 3'
                







Someone make this happen!

                    Wait, Did Sarah Jessica Parker Just Hint There Might Be a Third 'Sex and the City' Movie?
                







Oh. My. God.

 MORE >>





Though Sarah Jessica Parker’s tutu in Sex and the City’s opening credits is one of Carrie Bradshaw’s most iconic outfits, it nearly didn’t make it on the air.

According to creator Darren Star, an alternate opening was shot which featured the TV fashionista in blue as she trips over the sidewalk when she sees an ad for her column on the side of a bus. The footage, which was shot in March 1998 near Manhattan’s Plaza Hotel, was never shown — until now.
“There were two wardrobes. One was the tutu, and we did one pass where Sarah Jessica was wearing a blue dress and didn’t get splashed; instead, she trips when she sees the ad,” Star told Entertainment Weekly, who first got a hold of the 35-second clip. “In my mind, it was a nod to The Dick Van Dyke show, but we didn’t use it. It’s in the archives.”



A post shared by SJP (@sarahjessicaparker) on Mar 31, 2017 at 5:46am PDT


Costume designer Patricia Field said they shot Parker in various outfits because “it was very difficult for the producers to understand the tutu.”
Though Field and Parker were all for the tutu, which was found in a $5 bin on a showroom floor and recreated into four versions, Darren wanted to make sure they had other footage to show to execs in case it got nixed. In the end the showrunner believes sticking with the frilly frock was a good decision. “It was such a brilliant choice because, in a way, Carrie’s dancing through her life in New York,” he said.
Parker slipped back into the memorable number in the 2008 film when her character was seen cleaning out her closet. When word got out the alternate opening credits had surfaced online, the actress shared the video on Instagram writing, “Lost footage.
The alternate and never used title sequence from ‘SATC’ A really nice memory.” Watch the original opener — below.

Wanda Sykes Reveals Breast Cancer Diagnosis, Double Mastectomy/n
Add Wanda Sykes to the growing ranks of those who've battled cancer.The comedian revealed in an interview on Ellen, airing Monday, that she was diagnosed with breast cancer in February and underwent a double mastectomy, saying she didn't want to take any chances of a recurrence."It sounds scary upfront, but what do you want?" Sykes said matter-of-factly.And, the way she tells it anyway, the story of how her cancer was discovered is quite the hoot.

"I was having a breast reduction, actually," Sykes told Ellen DeGeneres."I had real big boobs, and I just got tired of knocking over stuff. Every time I eat...Oh, lord. I'd carry a Tide stick everywhere I go. My back was sore, so it was time to have a reduction. It wasn't until after the reduction that, in the lab work, the pathology, that they found that I had DCIS [ductal carcinoma in situ] in my left breast."I was very, very lucky," she continued, "because DCIS is basically stage zero cancer. So I was very lucky. But cancer is cancer. I had the choice of, you can go back every three months and get it checked. Have a mammogram, MRI every three months just to see what it's doing. But I'm not good at keeping on top of stuff. I'm sure I'm overdue for an oil change and a teeth cleaning already.  I have a lot of breast cancer history on my mother's side of the family, which I didn't know about."Instead, she opted for a bilateral mastectomy.

"Do you want to wait and not be as fortunate when it comes back and it's too late?" Sykes said.Despite her avid support for breast cancer awareness and fundraising, the Curb Your Enthusiasm player also said that she wasn't sure about opening up about her  struggle because she didn't want to become a "poster girl" for the  cause."How many things could I have? I'm black, then lesbian," she  explained jovially. "I can't be the poster child for everything! At  least with the LGBT issues we get a parade, we get a float, it's a  party. I was real hesitant about doing this because, I hate walking. I  got a lot of walks coming up!"So far, at least, Sykes is a poster girl for a great attitude.

Damon Dash is a wanted man.A warrant is out for the music and fashion mogul's arrest for failure to pay nearly $350,000 in child support to ex-wife Rachel Roy , a source confirms to E! News. The drama comes a week after Roy obtained full custody (with visitation rights for Dash) of their two daughters and secured a three-year restraining order against him. They divorced in 2009 after roughly four years of marriage.Since the warrant is civil and not criminal, it's only enforceable in New York, where the custody issues are playing out. So if police catch up with Dash in the state, he can be arrested and compelled to appear in court, where he'll face a possible six months in jail if he doesn't pay up.

Dash can completely avoid the possibility of jail time if he pays the $341,999.16 he owes Roy.Reps for Dash, who has not been responsive to requests for comment regarding these legal matters, could not be reached. The Roca-A-Fella Records co-founder also did not show up to hear the judge's custody ruling in person earlier this month. Roy is being represented by attorney Donnell Suares.Bossip was first to report on the latest divorce drama.A couple of weeks ago, Roy and her girls, 15-year-old Ava and 8-year-old Tallulah, made the stylish scene at the Los Angeles premiere of the documentary Dior & I, about the creation of creative director Raf Simon's first haute couture collection for the famed fashion house.

Minnesota Dentist Who Killed Cecil the Lion Returns to Work Today, Continues to Face Angry Protesters The Minnesota dentist who hunted and killed Cecil the Lion returned to work on Tuesday. Dr. Walter J. Palmer resumed his dental practice at.../n
The Minnesota dentist who hunted and killed Cecil the Lion returned to work on Tuesday.Dr. Walter J. Palmer resumed his dental practice at his Bloomington, Minn., office at around 7 a.m. in an attempt to resume his life and career following the global backlash to his involvement in killing the beloved lion in Zimbabwe. However, the presence of protesters, animal activists and media made sure his return was anything but business as usual.According to USA Today, angry protesters shouted at the dentist as he made a beeline for the front door of his office, and photographers and videographers made sure to document the moment. Bloomington police were called to the scene to ensure that the crowd didn't get out of hand and Palmer was able to enter his office safely.

Palmer closed his office in late July—a few days after the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force identified him as the man responsible for hunting and killing 13-year-old Cecil, who was part of an Oxford University research project and wore a GPS collar.Palmer, a sport big game hunter, reportedly paid $55,000 to participate in the hunt with professionals Theo Bronkhorst and farmer Honest Ndlovu. The trio first shot Cecil with a bow and arrow, but when that didn't kill him, they tracked him down 40 hours later and shot him with a gun. After trying and failing to destroy the GPS collar, they skinned and beheaded the beloved lion.

The gut-wrenching news of Cecil's death prompted worldwide outrage. Many celebrities took to their social media handles to publicly slam the dentist and speak out on behalf of the famous lion. PETA president Ingrid Newkirk even suggested Palmer be "extradited, charged and, preferably, hanged."The dentist issued a letter of apology to his patients, admitting his regret in the animal's death and saying he "had no idea that the lion I took was a known, local favorite, was collared and part of a study until the end of the hunt."Though he still believes everything about his hunting trip was legal, he added, "I deeply regret that my pursuit of an activity I love and practice responsibly and legally resulted in the taking of this lion. That was never my intention."

Dr. Conrad Murray Defense Expert Admits To Propofol Being Given To Beagle Dogs/n
By Jen Heger – Radar Legal Editor
Dr. Conrad Murray‘s star defense witness at the Michael Jackson death trial, Dr. Paul White, admitted that lawyers for the embattled cardiologist commissioned a study in which Beagle dogs were given Propofol, RadarOnline.com is reporting.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Murray’s lawyers were forced to abandon the theory that Michael Jackson had orally ingested the Propofol because test findings found that it was highly unlikely that someone could die from ingesting Propofol. 
Under blistering questioning from Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, Dr. White said, “The testing was done on the Beagles last summer. It was a negative study, and the results were never published.”
PHOTOS: Key Players In The Trial Of Dr. Conrad Murray
PETA has demanded a federal investigation into the Propofol testing on the dogs. PETA (the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organization), filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Monday alleging “cruel drug toxicity tests on beagles commissioned by the defense team of Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician now on trial for his alleged role in Michael Jackson’s death.
“PETA asserts that if attorneys from Flanagan, Unger, Grover & McCool did commission the tests for the drug propofol – the toxic effects of which have been extensively studied in dogs and humans – those tests were likely conducted in violation of the federal Animal Welfare Act’s prohibition against tests on animals that duplicate previous experiments. PETA has filed a complaint with the State Bar of California as well.”
Read PETA’s Letter To The USDA Demanding A Full Investigation
Walgren was relentless in questioning Dr. White about giving Propofol outside of a hospital setting. 
“Have you ever administered Propofol in someone’s bedroom?” Walgren asked.

“No I have not,” White said. 
“Have you ever heard of someone doing that prior to this case?” the DA asked.

“No I have not,” White stated.
Dr. White admitted to being paid $11,000 for his work on this case so far. Dr. White is going to be the final witness for the defense. It’s anticipated that Dr. White will be on the stand for the remainder of the day.

Whether she's working on the big screen or on a Broadway stage, Glenn Close has proven to be a true star.But before she became a Hollywood success story, the actress experienced a childhood very few can imagine. Turns out she spent part of her childhood in a religious cult known as the Moral Re-Armament."You basically weren't allowed to do anything, or you were made to feel guilty about any unnatural desire," Close explained in the new issue of The Hollywood Reporter. "If you talk to anybody who was in a group that basically dictates how you're supposed to live and what you're supposed to say and how you're supposed to feel, from the time you're seven till the time you're 22, it has a profound impact on you."It was her father, Dr. William Taliaferro Close, who first joined the cult. Unfortunately, it wasn't until Close enrolled at the College of William & Mary when she could escape. 

"I would have dreams because I didn't go to any psychiatrist or anything," she explained. "I had these dreams, and they started with betrayal, a sense of betrayal, and then they developed into me being able to look at these people and say, ‘You're wrong. You're wrong.' And then the final incarnation of those dreams was me being able to calmly get up and walk away. And then I didn't have them anymore."Despite the fragile state of mind, Close said the cult never tried to lure her back. Instead, she was able to follow her dreams and live a fulfilling life on her own terms.Back on Broadway in Edward Albee's "A Delicate Balance," Close believes her success is attributed to her ability to forgive the cult, even if it prevented her from experiencing a normal childhood."I always thought, the way life works, the burden of forgiveness is on the child," she said. "That's the way it goes. Forgiveness is probably the most revolutionary concept there is right now in our world. Because without forgiveness, you just perpetuate what has been before. You [have to] say, ‘It's going to stop with me.'"

Lakers' Lou Williams Cuffed In Vegas ... 'I Did Nothing Wrong' /nTMZ Sports has obtained footage of Lakers guard Lou Williams handcuffed by police and slammed up against a cop car in front of a casino in Vegas ... but the NBA player insists he did NOTHING wrong.  We've learned ... Williams was detained in front of The Cromwell hotel and casino on the Vegas strip in the early hours of September 13th ... after the Mayweather vs. Berto fight.  Witnesses at the scene tell us, Williams was involved in an altercation with  "a large man " -- and cops rushed in to break it up. We're told Williams adamantly denies being involved in a fight.  Williams was handcuffed and slammed up against a police car -- but the Las Vegas Metro Police Department tell us they have NO RECORD showing Williams was formally arrested that night.  We spoke with Lou's agent Wallace Prather III who tells us,  "Apparently there was an issue that [Lou] wasn't involved in, which is why they didn't arrest him. "  "If Lou was fighting in public in Las Vegas they would have arrested his ass ... he wasn't fighting anyone. " Eventually, cops released the cuffs and Williams was sent on his way.  We reached out to the LVMPD for an explanation -- but we haven't gotten one yet. /n
Politics, Paranoia, & Clowns! Let Your Fear Fester By Watching The Official American Horror Story: Cult Trailer!/n

We can blame Donald Trump for a lot of things — the heightened division of America, contentious relations with other world powers, and now… the rise of a clown-worshipping cult run by Evan Peters!
At least, that's what we took from the first full trailer for American Horror Story: Cult!
The clip finally dives deep into the latest season of Ryan Murphy's anthology series, with a closer look at Sarah Paulson (reprising her role as Paranoid Terrified Woman), Cheyenne Jackson (playing the resident seemingly-put-together-put-probably-crazy Therapist), and Billie Lourd (playing a spooky babysitter we'll call Lana Del Grey). Twisty the Clown makes a subtle cameo, too!
Video: Watch The Creepy AHS: Cult Opening Credits!
It all starts in Michigan on 2016's election night, when Trump's win triggers a crippling phobia for Ally Mayfair Richards (Paulson) — her fear of clowns.
Things don't get better when Paulson and her wife (newcomer Alison Pill) hire Winter Anderson (Lourd) to take care of their son — because Winter is secretly working with Kai Anderson (Peters), who is hellbent on using fear to get people to "set the world on fire."
Ch-ch-check out the trailer for AHS: Cult to see what political horrors await you!

'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' Director Allegedly Attacked by Ex, Shows Face Bruises/nTobe Hooper -- director of the iconic horror film  "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre " -- got beat up by his ex and has the bruises to prove it ... according to new legal docs. The 74-year-old was allegedly attacked by 36-year-old Rebecca Hodges 2 weeks ago, and was left with a battered face. Hooper claims there was another altercation in April where Hodges also punched him in the face. According to the docs ... the 2 used to date and live together, and Hooper's accusations against Hodges were enough to get a judge to order her to stay 100 yards away from him. We tried to contact Hodges ... no luck so far./n
Krystle Campbell ‘Loved People’ And Was ‘Always Smiling’/n
Krystle Campbell of Medford, Mass., has been identified as the second fatal victim in Monday’s bombings at the Boston Marathon.
As Campbell’s family comes to grips with their unbelievable loss, they want to remember her as the woman she really was — the funny and loving 29-year-old who would do anything for her family and friends.
“She was a very loving, happy person,” her grandmother Lillian Campbell told Celebuzz exclusively.
“She loved people and she loved to talk to people. She was a happy-go-lucky girl.”
Lillian remembers the selfless granddaughter who lived with her — and nursed her back to health — for a year and a half.
“When I was sick, she took care of me,” she said. “Any time I called her, she was here. She would take off work then go back to work.
“She volunteered to anyone who needed help. She loved people and would go out of her way for them.
“She was my No. 1 granddaughter. I have three grandchildren, but I was close to Krystle. She would always come over unannounced, even if it was for 5 or 10 minutes. She made the time to see me.”
The last time Lillian spoke with Krystle, who worked as a manager of nearby restaurant, was last Thursday.
“She didn’t mention the marathon, but she went every year and she looked forward to it – and then this had to happen to her.”
“We used to have such good times together as a family, laughing and carrying on.”
Krystle’s father, William Campbell Jr., she said had to identify her body today.
According to Yahoo! News, Krystle was waiting at the finish line alongside a friend Karen Rand, to cheer on her boyfriend, who was running the race.
“My daughter was the most lovable girl. She helped everybody, and I’m just so shocked right now,” William told Yahoo! News. “We’re just devastated. She was a wonderful, wonderful girl. Always willing to lend a hand.”
Now, Krystle’s grandmother is more concerned for her grieving son.
“I’m just worried about him because he’s not a well man,” Lillan said. “He’s been laid-up and not able to work. And she’s very close to her father. I don’t know what he’ll do without her. She’d do anything for him. She was so good to her mother, father and brother.”
However, Lillian is comforted to know that all Americans are mourning alongside her family.
“It hasn’t sunk in to me yet, except when I see her picture,” she said.
“The minute they see her face on TV, they’ll know Krystle. She looks so happy. She was always smiling.
More than 170 people were wounded in the explosions that tragically took three lives, including first victim, 8-year-old Martin Richard.
The third victim has not yet been identified.

Susan Sarandon: My Sexual Orientation Is 'Up For Grabs'/n
Susan Sarandon won’t be held down by labels — especially when it comes to her sexuality.
The 70-year-old made a shocking confession during an interview with PrideSource, admitting: “My sexual orientation is up for grabs, I guess you could say.”
Later, she divulged juicy details of her steamy affair with gay actor Philip Sayer, whom she met on set of 1973 film The Hunger.

“I did at one point have a very successful and very loving and wonderful affair with a man who then wasn’t with another woman after me, and that worked out fine!” the actress, now starring in Ryan Murphy’s Feud series, shared.
“I don’t think you had to declare yourself as rigidly as you do now in terms of having to declare yourself almost politically about your sexual preference,” she added.
Though she was previously married to Chris Sarandon from 1967-1979, had two sons, Jack Henry and Miles Guthrie, with long-term partner Tim Robbins and shares daughter Eva with Italian filmmaker Franco Amurri, Sarandon has also had a string of affairs with iconic stars like David Bowie and most recently Jonathon Brocklin.

“I’m a serial monogamist, so I haven’t really had a large dating career. I married Chris Sarandon when I was 20, and that went on for quite a while — each of my relationships have,” she told PrideSource.
“I haven’t exactly been in the midst of a lot of offers of any kind. I’m still not! I don’t know what’s going on!”

Tom Brady Wipes Out After Sharing Cute Video of Daughter Vivian, 4, Learning to Ski/n
Tom Brady may have the football skills in his family, but Vivian Lake is the ski pro.
The 4-year-old daughter of the Super Bowl LI champion quarterback and wife Gisele Bündchen showed off her skills on the slope in a video Brady, 39, shared to Instagram this week.
“That’s my girl! Pizzaing when she’s supposed to pizza, French frying when she’s supposed to French fry,” the proud dad captioned the clip, which features a background audio track of an instructor from a season 6 episode of South Park giving basic instructions about the sport.
“NOT having a bad time!!” added Brady, continuing to reference the show.

 If you french fry when you're supposed to pizza, you're gonna have a bad time! Trust me!!!

Brady followed up the clip with one of himself attempting a jump, wiping out in the snow in slow-motion.
“If you french fry when you’re supposed to pizza, you’re gonna have a bad time! Trust me!!!” he jokingly captioned the video, which cuts to the South Park instructor’s famous lines after the sports star’s fall.





 It’s hard to believe a week has passed since SB51. It’s hard to believe the game is only 60 minutes. It's harder to believe I've been a Patriot for 17 years! What happens on that field with my teammates, in front of our family and fans, is almost impossible to describe. It’s mythical for me, and yet it’s real. And it’s why I’ll never stop as long as I’m able. #ROS

The father of three — he and Bündchen, 36, also share 7-year-old son Benjamin Rein, while Brady is also dad to son John “Jack” Edward Thomas, 9 — has admitted that while he considers himself somewhat of a disciplinarian with his kids, he’s a lot softer when it comes to his little girl.
“It’s too hard — she’s too cute, and she just says, ‘Dad, please?’ and I say ‘Okay,’ ” he confessed to PEOPLE in October of disciplining Vivian. “My wife always says, ‘You gotta be tougher on her!’ and I say, ‘I can’t.’ “

Why The Bachelor Met Black Lives Matter: UnREAL Producer Says 'It Would Be a Shame to Be Too Scared to Do It'/n
Tragedy rocked UnREAL this week, making Lifetime’s satire of reality TV just another instance of art colliding with life to devastating effect.  
And while some shows have chosen to delay topical yet potentially controversial episodes in the wake of recent shootings that have drawn attention to race relations in the United States, UnREAL decided to face racism, violence and discomfort head-on in Monday’s episode.  
Spoiler warning: For those who haven’t watched the latest episode of UnREAL, plot details will be revealed.
The end of “Ambush” unflinchingly expressed the horror and anger of the cast and crew of Everlasting, the Bachelor-esque reality show-within-a-show, after the show’s first black suitor Darius (B.J. Britt) saw his friend Romeo (Gentry White) shot by an inexperienced police officer who was questioning them for taking a joy ride with two contestants.  
Stemming from a tragically terrible decision by off-the-rails producer Rachel (Shiri Appleby), who misrepresented the innocent drive in a call to police, the incident’s parallels to many recent events across the country is not lost on creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro and writer Ariana Jackson.  
“I definitely was like, ‘Oh s—,’ ” Shapiro says in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the episode’s reflection of all-too-recent headlines. “And then [my next thought was], ‘I hope we got it right’ because it’s such a crucial issue right now, and I feel really scared to be on the frontlines of it.”   
Says Jackson, “It would have been great for this episode to have been irrelevant by now. It’s hard to think about these real-life events in the context of what we want for our show. I wish it was last year’s problem and it felt dated by now.”  
B.J. Britt (as Darius, left), Freddie Stroma (as Adam) and Shiri Appleby (as Rachel) on UnREALLifetimeAs the team behind UnREAL began plotting season 2, Shapiro and her staff knew having a black suitor on Everlasting would offer up many opportunities for dialogue – but it also surfaced some fear and tension. When the outline for “Ambush” was pitched, they decided to embrace that discomfort.  
“I said, ‘I’m really scared and it makes me totally uncomfortable, but I think it’s worth doing,’ ” says Shapiro. “Where we landed as a [writers] room is that it’s better to do it than not do it and it would be a shame to be too scared to do it.”

Jackson, who is African American, admits she worried the episode might turn into “whitesplaining” but says the team was committed to having an honest conversation: “Everybody in the room was so willing to talk for days and weeks on ends about this stuff – really get into it and not only talk about it, but listen.”   
She continues, “We had really long discussions about all of it, and there were moments that got really tense and uncomfortable but at the end of the day everybody was actually hearing each other and we got to a place where we were able to tell this story.”   
Shapiro and Jackson emphasize that Romeo’s shooting links directly back to Rachel, an upper middle-class liberal white woman who made a rash decision without understanding the context or consequences for two black men. It was an innocent mistake, sure, but also an arrogant and possibly fatal one, and this sort of passive ignorance can be problematic when confronting and attempting to reconcile the issues surrounding police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement.  
“From the start, one of the important ideas is that Rachel has always been able to talk her way out of a traffic stop and so it didn’t occur to her that Darius wouldn’t be able to talk his way out of one. She didn’t realize what it meant to be a pretty little white girl,” says Shapiro, who reveals that the show did consider having Darius himself fall victim to the accidental shooting.   
Jackson explains further, “She’s gotten to know this guy and she sees him in a very different light, and I think it’s hard for people to understand that in our country right now any black body can be seen as so threatening in this kind of situation. People still have this idea of, ‘Well, they must have been kind of thuggish or they must have done something to warrant this kind of treatment,’ but the point is that we are at a place where that’s not necessarily true.”  
Says Shapiro, “That’s why we choreographed the pullover in the episode the way we did – that in a split second, a police officer who’s fearing for his life, when given the choice of a white woman [Rachel] running at him from a bush or a black man [Romeo] coming around a car, is always going to decide that the black man is more of a threat.”  
But the people behind UnREAL chose to put forth an alternative ending to so many of this situation’s real-world proxies: “It’s important that Romeo doesn’t die,” says Shapiro. “I feel like we’d probably be having a different conversation if he did.”  
UnREAL airs Mondays (10 p.m. ET) on Lifetime.

Gigi Hadid Posts Sexy Video to Confirm She'll Be Walking the Victoria's Secret Runway for a Third Time
/n

Third time’s a charm! It’s official: Gigi Hadid will be back walking the runway at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show this year.
Last week after models were spotted heading to the casting call in New York City for this year’s VS Fashion Show and a slew of newbies and returning favorites later revealed they made the cut, the Internet started buzzing. Why? Because a few major (non-Angel) names were missing from the list, including Gigi, who walked the show the past two years.

But today, Gigi silenced that speculation when she announced on Instagram that she would return to the runway another time.

“Forever and ever and ever a dream come true to be asked back to the VS Show !!! 🙌🏼
Thank you my friends @ed_razek @10magazine @johndavidpfeiffer @monica.mitro for another unforgettable opportunity; every aspect makes me feel like a dreaming kid again 🕊🕊🖤 (as shown here at last year’s fitting, by @jeromeduran)! ☁️ @victoriassecret #VSFS2017,” she captioned the post.

A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Aug 28, 2017 at 12:05pm PDT


Just this weekend, Gigi’s younger sister and fellow model Bella Hadid revealed that she too will be strutting her stuff down the catwalk at this year’s Victoria’s Secret show, after she made her debut last year infamously walking alongside her ex The Weeknd as he performed on stage.

“I feel so crazy humbled to get the opportunity to be a part of this show again… ” Bella captioned an Instagram post Saturday. “Walking into the offices this year i felt so happy, healthy, and honored.. I can’t wait for another incredible experience!!! Congrats to all of the beautiful ladies I will be walking beside. I can’t wait! Xx 💕🌸.”
During last year’s exciting show, when the Hadid sisters walked the show for the first time together, Gigi graduated to a whole new class of Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show models by getting her wings. Though she hasn’t been named an official Angel, it’s possible that her wings fittings will be even more momentous this year.
Of course, in typical mom fashion, the girls’ mother Yolanda Hadid had to make an appearance last year in Paris to support both her girls at the fashion show. And yes, she most definitely was a #proudmama.

A post shared by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid) on Nov 30, 2016 at 2:01am PST


“17 years after I photographed my ‘ANGELS’ today is the day that they will be walking in the fashion show together,” Yolanda captioned a throwback Instagram photo of the sisters posing wearing white angel wings.
By now we know most of the big-name models to expect to see walk the VS Fashion Show this fall, with one major exception: Gigi and Bella’s BFF Kendall Jenner, who walked the show with wings over the past two years. Only time will tell if Kris Jenner will join Yolanda Hadid in the confetti-flecked front row.

Jenelle Evans‘ baby daddy Nathan Griffith is taking their nasty custody battle from the courtroom to Twitter! After the Teen Mom 2 dad accused Evans and her fiancé David Eason of abusing their son Kaiser, Evans exclusively revealed to RadarOnline.com her side of the disturbing allegations.
“Every time we get Kaiser he is rather sick, has finger-like marks on [his] back,” Griffith wrote in now-deleted tweets. “[He’s] petrified when you mention David’s name.”
He explained that when he tries to talk to Evans about the issue, she “refuses to take any measures to co-parent Kaiser.”

“Kaiser used to love the water, but [now] Kaiser is petrified of the water. Why?” the rampage continued. “Kaiser told me he fell off the boat! Am I worried? Yes I am petrified!”
Griffith then claimed that Evans threatened to call CPS to accuse him of beating Kaiser, 3.
“[It’s] truly astonishing,” he said of the threat. “I love my child to death.”

But Evans, 25, exclusively told Radar that she is the one who contacted Griffith regarding their son.
“Nathan is upset because I simply asked him and his mother if Kaiser has been spanked this past weekend,” she wrote. “Nathan claimed no, but then claimed, ‘I’ll spank him if and when I want cause I’m his father.”
She continued that she is “highly against” physical punishment and that she will be speaking to her lawyer.

“Nathan is stressing out and is on some sort of rampage against me for asking a simple question,” she wrote. “He’s trying to turn it on David.”
This isn’t the first time the exes accused each other of abusing their son.
In May, Evans posted a photo of Kaiser with bruises on his arms.

Griffith tweeted in response to the photo, “If anyone dared lay a physical hand on either one of my kids, it would be hell on each real freaking quick.”
Evans told Radar that while he did have bruises, the marks weren’t from abuse.
“He scrapes his arms on the stones on the driveway because he runs all the time,” she clarified at the time.
Griffith currently has supervised visits with the 3-year-old.

Knife Found On O.J. Simpson Property Is NOT The Murder Weapon/n
Cops have confirmed RadarOnline.com’s report that a single blade knife allegedly found by an off-duty police officer on O.J. Simpson‘s property is not the murder weapon used to kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.
LAPD traffic officer George Maycott claimed that a construction worker at Simpson’s Rockingham house gave him a single blade knife a few years after the 1994 slayings and he held onto it until this year. He turned the knife over to the authorities who tested the blade for any evidence that it was linked to the double-homicide, but according to NBC News, law enforcement sources have now decisively ruled out the knife as the murder weapon.
Two weeks ago, Radar first reported that the knife could not possibly have been the weapon that was used in the brutal killing.

“Absolutely no way this is the knife!” Mike Gilbert, Simpson’s former agent, told Radar exclusively, pointing out that the weapon that killed Brown Simpson and Goldman “was a Swiss Army knife.”
“Plus there is NO way O.J. would have left the knife there,” Gilbert explained.
“He would have told me to go and get it. He would have drawn me a map and told me where it was. He would have been so afraid while he was in jail that the LAPD would have gotten another search warrant and found it. He couldn’t have dealt with the stress of it being there. And he would have gotten rid of it after he got out.”

Jane Fonda Is Auctioning Off Her Wedding Dress and Opal Engagement Ring from Ex-Husband Ted Turner/n
Tibrina Hobson/Getty
 
Jane Fonda is a fashion icon. How many 78-year-old women can pull off head chains, cutouts and crop tops? (Not many.) And now a few pieces from the actress’s collection are going up for sale in a new auction this September, which includes various art, jewelry, her wedding dress to Ted Turner and, yes, a leotard from her workout video days.
Julien’s Auctions will host the event titled, Property from the Collection of Jane Fonda, on September 23. Most notably, the sale includes her wedding dress and engagement ring from Turner, the cable-television tycoon and CNN founder, which are each estimated to each sell between $2,000-$4,000.

Her gown from their Capps, Florida, ceremony was a high-neck Victorian-inspired long-sleeve dress, while her engagement ring was an opal design set in 18-carat yellow gold between two round diamonds from Tiffany’s in Beverly Hills. Tiffany’s Peter Schneirla told EW that an opal is an “unusual” choice for an engagement ring, except when it is a birthstone, because opals have a long reputation for bringing bad luck.
The pair divorced in 2001 after ten years together and in Fonda’s petition stated that the marriage is “irretrievably broken” and there is “no hope of reconciliation.” In an interview with the New Yorker in 2001, she explained the differences that drew them apart.
“He knew my daughter was having a baby and it would take me away from him. He needs someone to be there one hundred percent of the time,” Fonda shared. “He thinks that’s love. It is not love. It’s babysitting. I didn’t want to tell you this. We went in different directions. I grew up.”

 Secrets Suppressed? Rupert Murdoch Tries To Have Angelina Jolie's Ex-Stunt Double.../n
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie‘s secrets could be saved from being spilled in a courtroom if Rupert Murdoch prevails in having a phone hacking lawsuit tossed, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The British-based former stunt double of Jolie, Eunice Huthart, launched legal proceedings against Murdoch’s media empire in June, alleging her mobile phone messages were intercepted by the now defunct News of the World and The Sun newspapers.
As scandalous as those charges were, her initial filing also revealed salacious details about how Jennifer Aniston‘s then-husband Pitt secretly checked into a hotel with Angelina Jolie — posing as a married couple.
In any trial, the love life of the famed couple and how they carried on a secret romance on the set of the 2005 film Mr. & Mrs. Smith would inevitably be subject to exploration.
Read The Motion To Dismiss
But in a lucky break for Pitt and Jolie, Murdoch’s News Corporation has formally asked a judge to dismiss the suit, arguing Huthart, a British citizen and resident, should have filed the claim in the United Kingdom.
“Plaintiff’s claim too should proceed in the UK, if anywhere,” lawyers for News Corporation write in documents obtained exclusively by RadarOnline.com.
“Plaintiff does not allege that any of the claimed tortious acts occurred in the United States nor that the U.S. entity engaged in wrongdoing… the Court should dismiss the complaint on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.”
The documents also reveal that if the lawsuit is dismissed in Los Angeles and Huthart opts to refile in England, News Corp won’t object to any potential legal statute of limitations which may have since lapsed.
PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Best Kept Secrets
A judge is expected to rule on the matter in a hearing scheduled for January 6, 2014.
Huthart is also the godmother of Pitt and Jolie’s daughter Shiloh.
The legal maneuver comes at the same time that the alleged architects of the phone hacking system, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, face criminal charges in a British court.
On Thursday, it emerged the pair also carried on an illicit affair.

A prosecutor revealed how their affair was uncovered by police who searched Brooks’ home and found a letter – “intelligent, elegant and well-written” – she wrote to Coulson in 2004.
“You are my very best friend, I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you, we laugh and cry together,” Mrs Brooks wrote. “Without our relationship in my life I am not sure I will cope.” /n
Gavin Rossdale Is Dating Model Sophia Thomalla Following Gwen Stefani Divorce/n





                    Gwen Stefani Calls Gavin Rossdale Split 'Months and Months of Torture'
                







It's no secret that Gwen Stefani's divorce with Gavin Rossdale was a rough one.

It looks like Gavin Rossdale is off the market again.

A year after finalizing his divorce with Gwen Stefani, the Bush frontman is said to be dating German model Sophia Thomalla.
The couple first sparked relationship rumors in April when they were photographed sharing a kissing in London’s Primrose Hill. According to Us Weekly, Rossdale, 51, and Thomalla, 27, recently took their romance to Indianapolis’ Iozzo’s Garden of Italy, where they were seen sharing a “romantic meal” on May 11.

Thomalla is the first woman Rossdale has been linked to since his split with his wife of 13 years. As previously reported, the singer and Stefani, 47, broke things off in 2015 after it was discovered that Rossdale allegedly had an affair with his children’s former nanny, Mindy Mann.
“[Divorce] was completely opposite to what I wanted. Really not … but here we are,” he told The Sun’s Fabulous magazine in January. “Apart from death, I think divorce is one of the hardest, most painful things to go through.”
Rossdale and Stefani — who has been dating country crooner Blake Shelton for over a year — continue to be co-parents to sons Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo, 3.

Unlike most of Hollywood, new parents Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford have given their newborn daughter a fairly normal name.

While attending the premiere of Suffragette, Mulligan, 30, revealed the name of her new baby and explained the surprisingly low-key way on how she picked the name with her Mumford & Sons frontman husband.
“[Her name is] Evelyn,” the actress told Entertainment Tonight. “[We] just came up with it.”
Previously, Mulligan confirmed she gave birth to a daughter on the The Graham Norton Show, saying, “It is a girl and she’s three weeks old.”
Though word of the parents expecting their first child together got out in June, Mulligan and Mumford, 28, never confirmed the pregnancy until after their baby was born. A source told E! News at the time, “Carey has given birth to a healthy and happy baby. She is just enjoying this time with her family and close friends.”

Britney Spears' Infamous Attack Umbrella Hitting Auction Block/nThe green umbrella Britney Spears unleashed on a paparazzo after shaving her head in 2007 is hitting the auction block ... and at a decent price, if you've got thousands of dollars laying around.  Daniel Ramos, the pap whose car Britney clubbed with the thing, says he's ready to part with the piece of pop culture history since he thinks Brit Brit's in a good place.

Last week's collection of great new tunes.

Looking for new tunes? We’ve got you covered.

So much new music is released each week that it’s impossible to hear it all. Not that you’d want to; a lot of it isn’t so hot. But let us help simplify your search for new sounds with a roundup of the week’s 11 best new songs. Trust us. We have good taste. (And check out last week’s collection if your hunger has still not been sated.)
Note: Unfortunately, due to the fact Lemonade is streaming exclusively on TIDAL (and now, apparently, Pandora), we are unable to provide stream embeds for the Beyoncé songs mentioned below. But do yourself a favor and just go support the best album released in 2016 so far if you haven’t already.
Beyoncé – “Hold Up”
It’s nearly impossible to pick a favorite song off of Beyoncé’s flawless sixth album Lemonade, but “Hold Up” absolutely ranks in the top three. In this song, which I can almost guarantee will be her next single, Bey’s sings about infidelity in a way that’s fun to listen to. – Jelani
Meghan Trainor – “Better” (ft. Yo Gotti)

While Meghan Trainor’s new collab with Yo Gotti is unexpected, it nevertheless makes for an excellent song. It’s completely different from her usual poppy “retro” sound, in a great way. I’m surprised to hear myself say that I’m looking forward to more of her new songs, given my appreciation for the oddly addicting “No,” and now “Better.” – Kaitlyn
Beyoncé – “6 Inch” (Feat. The Weeknd)
Almost every track on Lemonade stands out on its own way; it is very difficult for me to pick one (or even a few) favorite(s). My favorite track changes minute-by-minute, but currently I feel compelled to give props to the sexy “6 Inch,” featuring The Weeknd. If you choose to listen to Lemonade as a straightforward narrative — woman believes her husband is cheating on her, confronts him, confronts her own hurt and anger, threatens to leave him, begins a personal journey towards forgiveness and redemption, achieves closure, and transcends —  “6 Inch” comes at the point in the story where the woman has seemingly chosen to leave her man and is on the prowl (for something: The Next One, self-empowerment, maybe both). The very end of the song — “You always come back to meeeeeeeeeee” — brings about the turning point of the album; it is the very moment where Beyoncé ditches the “boy, bye” chapter and begins her introspective journey towards understanding, discovery, freedom, and, ultimately, happiness. On an album full of moments, that turn is one of the most powerful. – Matt
Blink 182 – “Bored to Death”





Blink 182 has a new band lineup (so long, Tom Delonge) and a new album (their seventh) coming out, entitled California. “Bored to Death” is our first taste, and it’s incredibly reminiscent of their music from the mid-2000s, i.e. my youth. And that’s not a bad thing at all. – Kaitlyn
Calum Scott – “Dancing on My Own”

I am a huge fan of Robyn’s “Dancing On My Own,” so when I heard about Calum Best (from Britain’s Got Talent) and his cover of the hit, I was quite skeptical. He gives the song a sparse makeover, simply accompanied by a piano and some very emotive vocals. He really has a great voice and it suits the arrangement of the song extremely well. You’re going to have this one on repeat. – Michael
Beyoncé – “Sandcastles”
This song will forever remind me of the catharsis that I felt upon my first listen of Beyoncé’s Lemonade after experiencing the turmoil, whether fact or fictitious, of the infidelity in her marriage with Jay Z. The vocals are raw, exuding the the fragility of love, the vulnerability of the human heart, and the forgiveness — both internal and external — that comes as a result of accepting each others’ scars of imperfection. TL;DR: it made me cry. – Mia
Clare Maguire – “The Valley”

I chose Clare Maguire’s “Elizabeth Taylor” for inclusion in this feature a few weeks ago, and now, if “The Valley” is indication, her upcoming album Stranger Things Have Happened will be a homerun. “The Valley” trades “Elizabeth Taylor’s” sullen, minimalst piano balladry for a dusky, soulful march, more Feist than Lana Del Rey. But its sweeping chorus will lift you up from the valley floor to the very top of the mountain. – Matt
Come back next week (and not a moment before then! JK!) for another batch of fresh music.

Katie's Big Slim-Down For Tom - And Wedding?/nCould it be that Katie Holmes has gone through a dramatic weight-loss regimen to get herself in shape so she can pour herself into a wedding dress? According to a report this morning, her baby daddy /fiance Tom Cruise has been  "eager " to get Katie to get fit, and that evidently she's done him proud. "Katie has lost a lot of weight. A lot, " tells an observer to MSNBC's Jeannette Walls.  "I've heard that Tom was eager to get her back in shape. Looks like she made him happy. And then some. " The prevailing buzz, of course, is that a TomKat wedding is imminent, and Cruise's rep Arnold Robinson has maintained all along that the pair will be getting married sometime this fall. Oh, Really? Janet and Justin Conspire Even though Janet Jackson hasn't exactly shown piles of affection recently towards Justin Timberlake, her partner in crime in the famous  "wardrobe malfunction " of the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, a report this morning suggests that she and Justin are cooking up a big surprise reunion as a publicity stunt.According to Page Six, the two pop idols' camps are in talks to get the pair together in  "some sort of big, live show like the Grammys or the Oscars. " The pair, as Janet has been saying recently as she promotes her new album  "20 Y.O. ", haven't really talked since that fateful day, and Janet also told Oprah that she was none too happy that Timberlake didn't stick up for her after the deluge. Both star's reps denied any knowledge of a reunion. Ashton Finishes First and Second At Weekend B.O. Whether playing a cartoon deer or a Coast Guard rescue swimmer, Ashton Kutcher reeled in the audiences this weekend, as both new releases featuring him (or at least his voice) finished at the top of the box office. The animated comedy  "Open Season, " also featuring the voice of Martin Lawrence, finished first, with a debut take of $23 million.  "Season " was the first release for fledgling Sony Pictures Animation.Meanwhile, Disney's  "The Guardian, " in which Kutcher co-stars with Kevin Costner, opened with a healthy $17.7 million weekend. Last week's top finisher,  "Jackass Number Two, " dropped to third place with $14 million, giving the prankster pic a ten-day total of $51.5 million. And another debut, the comedy  "School for Scoundrels, " opened in fourth at $9.1 million. Overall, the top 12 movies brought in $85.1 million, up 13 percent from the same weekend last year.  Party Favors: Ivanka Heats It Up With Lance? ... Martha May Need To Get (New) Hip ... Some Dude Pays $21,000 for Dinner with Petra It's an unlikely match, but young business tycoon Ivanka Trump could be cyclist Lance Armstrong's latest conquest, if Page Six is to be believed. Ivanka's been out in LA shooting the latest edition of  "The Apprentice " and will be the new spokeswoman for Tiffany, and lips are flapping that the pair are dating ... Martha Stewart could be headed for the operating room after the current season to replace a bum hip, according to a source in Lloyd Grove's column. But Stewart's rep says,  "There are no plans for surgery. She has a torn muscle, and she's waiting for it to heal. " ... Supermodel Petra Nemcova may have had boyfriend James Blunt by her side, but, report Rush & Molloy, that didn't stop a couple of Wall Street guys from getting into a fierce bidding war over her. The winner ended up shelling out $21,000 for dinner with the beauty, who's donating the sum to the Happy Hearts Fund, her charity that helps children who have suffered in natural disasters, just as she did in the 2004 Asian tsunami.

92-Year-Old Harriette Thompson Becomes Oldest Woman Ever to Finish a Marathon/n
Harriette Thompson has done it again! The 92-year-old cancer survivor just ran her 16th marathon and broke another record.  
Thompson, of Charlotte North Carolina, completed the Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon in San Diego on Sunday, making her the oldest woman to finish the 26.2-mile race, NBC Washington reported. (She snagged the title from Gladys Burrill, who was a younger 92 when she completed the Honolulu Marathon in 2011.)  
“I’m amazed that [people are] interested,” Thompson, who is a two-time cancer survivor, told reporters after her race. “I just feel I don’t deserve this, but I’m enjoying it.”  
According to Runner’s World, she crossed the finish line with a time of 7 hours, 24 minutes and 36 seconds – and lots of supportive cheers from a crowd of race-watchers.   
“Every year I write to my friends and say, this is my last year,” she said. “And then I do another one.”  
Thompson told the press that she ran it for her son, a captain in the Navy who was recently diagnosed with cancer. She also explained that she trained beforehand, while keeping in mind, “If I did it before, maybe I can do it again.”  
“I just don’t think of myself being that unusual. I have a lot of people saying what an inspiration I am. That’s nice to hear, good for something at this age,” she said, adding that she hopes she can continue running.  
Thompson has now run the San Diego race 16 times. Last year, at the age of 91, she set a record for a woman 90 or older when she finished in 7 hours, 7 minutes and 42 seconds. (She said the attention made her feel like a queen for a day!)

After her completion of the 2014 Rock ‘n’ Roll run, Thompson told Newswire that there is no age limit when it comes to physical activity.  
“You’re never too old to do it,” she said at the time. “I started my first marathon at 76.”

PRESIDENT OBAMA
“Your issue on President Obama’s Inauguration is a keeper and a treasure I’ll save for my grandkids”
Marlene Kohl
Penn Valley, Pa.
Thank you for showing the impact of our new President on all Americans, regardless of color. So much of the media have only taken a look at the effect on the African-American population. While I appreciate the impact this historic event has had on them, all of us—red and yellow, black and white—now have a new President and real hope for change.
Julie Yack
Colorado Springs, Colo.
I thoroughly enjoyed all of the pictures of Michelle Obama during the Inaugural festivities. However, I was disappointed that there was only one small shot of Jill Biden, waving goodbye to the Bushes’ helicopter. I really wanted to see what Mrs. Biden wore to the balls. When I went online there were many photos of Mrs. Biden wearing a stunning red dress. She is a beautiful woman and I think you could have featured more pictures of her and the Vice President.
Sue Charpie
Wheaton, Ill.
We lost our fashion icon Princess Diana more than 11 years ago. With Michelle Obama, we now have a new trendsetter to guide us. Bravo to the First Lady!
Sue Kelson
Dallas, Texas
How wonderful—Obama has taken office. Now can you please try to have at least one issue without the newest “American Idol” in it? Kindly remember, not all your readers voted for him.
Kimberly Wigley
Chesterton, Ind.
Will someone please tell former First Daughter Patti Davis that her negative rants about the misery of life with the Reagans in the White House are so boring and unattractive? We’ve had to listen to her whine and complain for too many years; she really needs to move on.
Liz Steenbeeke
Puyallup, Wash.
FLIGHT 1549
In a week filled with spectacle and miracles, the one achieved by Captain Sullenberger and Co-pilot Skiles on the Hudson River, saving all 155 people aboard, was magnificent. They’ll be my requested pilots from now on.
C.V. Roberts
Martin, Ga.
I don’t understand why you devoted almost an entire issue to Inauguration parties, concerts and styles, yet only three pages to one of the greatest survival stories this country has ever seen—the “Miracle on the Hudson.” It appears your priorities need adjusting.

PASSAGES
I was very surprised to see such a small article on the death of Ricardo Montalban. He opened the door for so many Latino actors over the years. And his presence was one of grace, dignity and character. He deserved a longer tribute from your magazine.
Cecelia Hernandez
Torrance, Calif.
THE OBAMA EFFECT
President Obama and his family are creating their own stimulus package for everything from volunteerism to ice cream. On Jan. 20 the Peace Corps’ online applications doubled over the same day the year before. A source tells PEOPLE that J. Crew, which made the girls’ Inaugural coats, had a 400 percent increase in online sales for its children’s clothing line Crewcuts. Marvel Comics’ latest Spider-Man, which features Obama, sold out within hours and is on track to be their best seller in 15 years. For January, Ben & Jerry’s changed “Butter Pecan” to “Yes Pecan!”—a riff on Obama’s theme “Yes, We Can.” Says Alliance CEO John Eckel, a marketing expert: “He’s a rock star.”
Correction
In our Feb. 2 issue, we should have attributed the song “At Last” to songwriters Mack Gordon and Harry Warren, rather than singer Etta James.

Aaron Hernandez's Girlfriend Indicted On A Perjury Charge In Murder Case/n
Former New England Patriot star Aaron Hernandez‘s girlfriend has been indicted on a perjury charge in connection with the murder of his friend, Odin Llyod, RadarOnline.com is reporting.
According to the New York Post, a grand jury indicted Hernandez’s girlfriend Shayanna Jenkins on Friday for a single count in relation to the investigation of the killing of Lloyd, as well as his cousin Tanya Singleton on a charge of conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact.
Llyod was found shot to death in North Attleborough, Mass., on June 17.
A grand jury also indicted Hernandez’s associate, Carlos Ortiz, on an accessory to murder charge.
PHOTOS: Inside The Aaron Hernandez Crime Scene
Prosecutors claim Ortiz and Ernest Wallace was with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, and Wallace was also indicted on a charge of accessory to murder after the fact. He has pleaded not guilty and been ordered held on $500,000 bail.
Hernandez, 23, plead not guilty to the murder of Lloyd and is being held without bail.
In jailhouse letters exclusively obtained by Radar the former footballer opened up to a fan about how much he would miss his 9-month-old daughter, Avielle.
“I miss my little girl terribly an (sic) my biggest fear of all is she won’t daddy,” Hernandez complained to pen pal Collin Imm, who supplied a copy of the letter exclusively to Radar.
PHOTOS: Celebs Involved In Murder
“She said daddy (for the) first time or should I say ‘Da Da’ and (I) had to hear it from jail.”
Before Jenkins was indicted on Friday, authorities alleged that she “made overt attempts to hide evidence, render assistance for suspect to elude law enforcement and to hinder and mislead” the investigation. /n
 Michael Jackson’s Forgotten Fortune: Secret Art Collection Uncovered & Valued At.../n
By Dylan Howard – Senior Executive Editor, Star magazine
Michael Jackson secretly left behind an almost billion-dollar secret art fortune that is now at the center of an international tug of war, Star has exclusively learned.
The never-before-seen collection would have insured the King of Pop’s surviving children were looked after for life. But in a startling twist, the secret vault has been sold out from underneath them, at a ‘bargain basement’ price, relatively speaking.
Lawyers running the late Thriller singer’s estate are moving to block the $87.7 million sale to an undisclosed international businessman, in a desperate attempt to return the incredible treasure to Prince, 13, Paris, 12, and Blanket, 8, and their guardian, Jackson’s mother Katherine.
In an astonishing appraisal of the 182-pieces, obtained exclusively by Star, the “rare intact major collection” was valued at a whopping $902.52 million, with “an invaluable pedigree for future sales in the international art market.”

“Michael’s mystique in life combined with this exposure of his wonderful fine art creations following his tragic death will escalate the value of these works and the popularity of his artistic vision worldwide,” appraiser Eric Finzi, a certified member of the International Society of Appraisers, wrote in a document obtained by the magazine.
“I do not think we have begun to see the true value of this fine art yet.”
The loot is so valuable that it’s worth almost more than Jackson’s other assets combined, including copyrights to his pop hits and the Beatles’ catalog, which he purchased in 1998 for $47.5 million.
Jackson, who was once famously called “a millionaire who lived like a billionaire,” built the extensive collection of sculptures and sketches that he drew while being taught by an Australian artist, Brett-Livingston Strong, who was a close friend.
Strong and his advisors orchestrated the deal recently, Star has learned.

In a letter sent to the artist, Dr. Tohme Tohme, Jackson’s last business manager and spokesperson, paved the way for the sale, transferring over the collection of artwork — free of charge — “to keep, sell, copy, exhibit and to use in whatever way you wish.”
“Michael wants you to know he is truly grateful for the loyalty you have shown him over the years, and he views this as a small token of appreciation for your continued friendship and artistic partnership,” Dr. Tohme wrote in the hand-signed letter, dated November 17, 2008, obtained by Star.
But now legal experts are now examining the validity of the document concerned that it could be a fake.
They also have questions over Jackson’s knowledge of the purported agreement.
“Michael’s signature nor his initials are inked on the document that purports to gifts hundreds of millions of dollars to Strong, at a time when Michael was swamped in debt,” a source close to the Jacksons told Star.
“It doesn’t make sense that he would give it up.”

The insider added: “Michael’s mother and his children were the dearest thing to him in his life, so it beggars belief that he would not want them to benefit from this collection, financially.”
Complicating matters, the source close to the Jacksons said Dr. Tohme has refused to swear an affidavit confirming the letter was true.
He was asked to do so by Howard Mann, the controversial Toronto gambling entrepreneur who is Katherine Jackson‘s business partner, Star has learned.
While Mann refused to comment when contacted about the deal, it’s emerged he was bidding for the collection against Guy Laliberté, the former street performer who founded Cirque du Soleil and went on to become a billionaire. Neither man was successful.

The collection is as bizarre as the rest of the singer’s turbulent life and includes intricate designs for chairs, gates, sculptures and elaborate doors he dreamed of installing at Neverland, Jackson’s former home (and amusement park and zoo), located 125 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
Each item tells a story about Jackson and throw light on mysteries which have puzzled fans for decades.
Star uncovered:
* Sketches of Jackson’s own feet doing his signature move from ‘Billie Jean’, the Moonwalk, now one of the best-known dance techniques in the world. Those original drawings have been valued at $600,000 each.
* His fascination with the number 7. In a series of artworks, Jackson sketched the numeral — which coincided with the star’s three biggest albums — “Thriller,” “Bad” and “Dangerous” — each producing 7 top 40 hits. Jackson was also the 7th of 9 children.
* Recreations of the Statue of David and Dying Slave, the masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture by Michelangelo.
* His first work of art, “We the People,” on Presidential archival paper. It’s said to be worth $3 million, according to the appraisal.
* An interesting political relic: The U.S. Presidency Seal signed by President Ronald Reagan. Jackson had visited the White House on May 16, 1984.
* After that visit, Jackson sketched ‘The White House Doors’ — a drawing appraisers have estimated is worth at $3 million.
* Sketches of Martin Luther King, President Abraham Lincoln and President George Washington, worth in all, more than $8.1 million, it’s suggested.
* A self portrait emblazoned on a plaque to be the feature of an entrance to a theater at Neverland. There’s also an image of what Jackson titled the ‘Peter Pan Magic Gate.’
* Hand-signed sepia prints of ‘The Book,’ reputed to be the only portrait he ever posed for. The portrait depitcs Jackson dressed in red velvet holding a journal of thoughts and sketches.
* Sketches of the plane with which the Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved controlled flight. Jackson was said to have been fascinated with how the Wrights were able to fly. In a 2007 visit to the the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space and American Indian museums, he lingered over the actual 1903 Wright Flyer.
The collection also includes a rocking chair made by one of President John F. Kennedy’s White House staffers for the president’s use in the oval office during his term in office.
The chair was presented to Michael by Walt Disney’s brother, Roy E. Disney.
PHOTOS: Stars Arrive At World Premiere Of This Is It
The art was created at a top secret and inconspicuous airport hanger at Santa Monica Airport in California, Star has learned.
“The successful bidder put down a payment of $37.7 million to secure the art and agreed to pay a further $50 million upon receipt of a release from the estate,” an insider close to the deal told Star.
“That’s what raised the red flag — the release has not been forthcoming and it’s ignited this tug of war.“

LeRoy Neiman, Popular Sports Artist, Dies at 91/n
LeRoy Neiman, the prolific artist whose dynamically colored paintings and sketches celebrated heroic figures of sports, entertainment and the good life, died Wednesday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, his publicist confirmed to PEOPLE. He was 91.  
“His wife [of more than 50 years] Janet and some loved ones were at his bedside,” the rep said.   
Cutting an eye-catching figure with his wide mustache and long cigar, Neiman was a larger-than-life yet approachable figure who epitomized the magazine with which he had a long association, Playboy – both in his personal style and that of his art.  
Born LeRoy Runquist in St. Paul, Minn. (Neiman was his stepfather’s name), the aspiring artist began his career in Catholic school, drawing ink tattoos on the arms of his fellow students. Drafted into World War II, he served as a cook in mess halls he decorated with his murals.   
After studying and then teaching at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, he began his distinctive style by using quick brush strokes with the enamel paint that was being tossed out by a building janitor, reports The New York Times.  
The Playboy association began in the mid-’50s, when Hugh Hefner’s magazine was still new and the two men met in Chicago. Once the publisher saw Neiman’s canvases with their energetic depictions of boxers and nightlife denizens, a professional marriage was born.   
Not only did Neiman go on globe-trotting expeditions for the magazine – he covered many an Olympic game – but he also devised the “Femlin,” the barely dressed cartoon figure who populated the Party Jokes page.  
“I’ve had a lucky life,” Neiman told the AP in 2008. “I’ve zeroed in on what you would call action and excellence. … Everybody who does anything to try to succeed has to give the best of themselves, and art has made me pull the best out of myself.”  
Venus and Serena Williams at the U.S. Open, by LeRoy Neiman (2002)Philip Boroff/Bloomberg News/Getty Even so, like the fantasy artist Thomas Kincaid, who died this past May, Neiman’s bank account was much larger than his critical reputation. (So large, in fact, that he was a generous benefactor to arts groups and schools, including a 1995 donation of $6 million to Columbia University’s School of the Arts to endow the LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies, according to The Times).  
Not that critical disdain seemed to rankle Neiman. “I can easily ignore my detractors and feel the people who respond favorably,” he told the AP.  
In terms of commercial popularity, says The Times, Neiman ranked along with Norman Rockwell, Grandma Moses and Andrew Wyeth.

Édgar Ramírez on Jumping Out of a Window to Survive an Avalanche on the Set of Gold: 'I Landed on a Goat'
/n

Édgar Ramírez jumped out of a window to escape an avalanche while filming Gold in the jungles of Thailand and fortunately for him, a goat was there to break his fall.
The Hands of Stone actor recounted the harrowing tale during a recent sit down with PEOPLE Now, where he revealed no one involved with the shoot — including the goat — was injured during the ordeal.
“Yeah there was an avalanche, there was a tree avalanche, when we were shooting in a little hut, this little cabin in the jungle,” the actor remembered.
He said he heard the whooshing sound of the avalanche first, and then noticed that the Thai consultants working on the film had begun screaming “in horror.” Finally, when Ramírez and others realized debris was landing on the roof of the hut, he said, “We had to jump out of the cabin, and I landed on a goat.”
He reiterated that no actors, crew members or goats were injured at the time.
Gold, also starring Matthew McConaughey, hits theaters nationwide Jan. 27.

Prince William, Kate Middleton and Prince Harry all gathered outside the Westminster Abbey on Wednesday (Apr. 5, 2017) to pay tribute to the four people killed during the London terror attack last month.

Attending on behalf of the entire royal family, the trio laid a wreath with a handwritten message reading: “For PC Keith Palmer, and all those who have served our community so valiantly. Your legacy is our way of life. William.”
During the multi-faith service, William also read a bible passage from the Gospel of Luke. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge and Harry lit candles in remembrance of the lives that were lost.
The memorial took place just two weeks after Khalid Masood drove a vehicle into a crowd of people at the Westminster Bridge before fatally stabbing a police constable near the Houses of Parliament. Several surviving victims from the incident also attended the service.
Previously, William met with the London Ambulance Service paramedics who treated injured victims. His father, Prince Charles, later visited patients in King’s College Hospital following the attack.

'RHOBH' Star David Foster Mourns Death Of Longtime Confidant, Singer Natalie Cole/n
Amid his own struggles following the demise of his marriage to ailing Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster, music producer was hit with another blow Jan. 1 when he lost his beloved friend, Natalie Cole.
As Radar reported, Cole died at age 65 of congestive heart failure. Foster, a music producer who has known Cole for more than 25 years, took the news of her passing especially hard. “[I’m filled with] profound sadness,” he told People Magazine, adding that he had trusted Cole, “with secrets [he] wouldn’t tell anyone else.”
He reflected on their earlier years recording together, and their collaboration on the hit song, “Unforgettable.”

“We had no clue it would strike a chord with anybody. We certainly didn’t think it would get on pop radio,” he remembered. “It was a monster hit.”
The 67-year-old musician also marveled at the enduring quality of her voice, even as her health began to deteriorate. “Her voice was always silk,” David said. “Even in the last few months when she lost a bit of power, her voice was still silky.”

According to the lawsuit, filed yesterday in NY, several employees have lodged complaints about Nancy's  "offensive " behavior ... including one time in 2009, when she barged into a meeting and  "pointed to each [attendee] and said, 'PENIS, PENIS, PENIS, PENIS' and then walked out.

"Archie Comics claims it hired an outside firm to investigate the allegations -- and the company recommended Archie cut ties with Nancy ASAP. Now, Archie wants a judge to grant an injunction -- barring Nancy from returning to the office ... and preventing her from representing the company at the upcoming Comic-Con in San Diego.Attempts to reach Nancy were unsuccessful./n

Samuel L. Jackson Blasts Ben Carson Over Slave Ships, 'Muthafukka Please!!!'/nSamuel L.

" Jackson fired back,  "Immigrants? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAFUKKA PLEASE!!! " He buttoned up the tweet with a hashtag that's a barely veiled  "Uncle Tom " reference.  OK!!

Harrison Ford Spends Star Wars Day with a Good Book /nHarrison Ford's idea of the perfect May the Fourth -- curling up with a novel. You'd think Han Solo would log some air miles flying his plane, helicopter or the Millennium Falcon on Star Wars Day ... but instead he hit the Brentwood Market while clutching the book,  "News of the World. " It's not even a sci-fi novel for cryin' out loud -- it's set in 1870 northern Texas! Maybe Harrison's just reading up for a future movie role, but we think Chewie would be highly disappointed. Then again ... Han's dead.  Spoiler alert?/n

Cold Blooded! Jodi Arias' Grandmother Dies — How She Dissed Her Family/n
Jodi Arias is a cold hearted person, even when it comes to her own family!
The convicted killer is serving a life sentence at the Perryville Prison in Arizona. RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that her grandmother has died, but although inmates are allowed to request special visitation or even to leave the maximum security prison for funerals, Arias didn’t even try!
Her grandmother, Wilma Caroline Allen, passed away on April 25, 2016 and her memorial service will be held on May 14, 2016 at the Girdner Funeral Chapel in Yreka, California.
PHOTOS: See 25 Photos Of Evidence That Got Jodi Arias Convicted Of Murder
“Inmate Arias did not request a contact visit with her grandmother [before her death] and did not request permission to travel to California for her grandmother’s funeral,” the Arizona Department of Corrections Public Information Officer told Radar. “Consequently, there were no requests approved or denied.”
Arias is currently not allowed to have contact visits after committing a disciplinary infraction as Radar exclusively reported. She called a guard a “c**k-blocker,” and was punished by losing contact visit privileges for at least 180 days, beginning February 9, 2016.
Arias was hardly estranged from her grandparents. She even lived with her them when she was arrested in 2008. Her grandfather’s gun, a .25 caliber handgun, was reported stolen just a few days before Alexander was shot with the same caliber weapon. Arias’s videotaped interview about the firearm with Detective Flores was played for the jury on Day 6 of her first trial.

“We’re just playing games here … That gun was in your possession … What did you do with the gun?” Flores asked her.
“I don’t have a gun … I’ve never seen it … I don’t even know what a .25 looks like,” Arias said.
Flores pointed out to Arias that the cabinet where the .25 caliber gun was stored at her grandparent’s home had several other guns that were left untouched, an odd coincidence considering Alexander was killed with the same caliber gun.

During her testimony Arias claimed that remembered shooting Alexander but that she was in a “fog” after that, and did not remember what she had done with the gun. During her sentencing, she lashed out at the judge and Alexander’s family and said she recalled more from his murder and stated that he was “alive” when she slit his throat.
In another cruel move, after Arias slaughtered Alexander, she sent his grandmother a bouquet of flowers and a note expressing her sympathies over his death, despite that fact that she herself had stabbed him 29 times, shot him in the face and slit his throat. During her testimony, Arias said Alexander’s grandmother was the only family member she had met and it would have been “worse” if she hadn’t sent anything. /n
 Comic Jim Norton On Paris Jackson: 'How Do You Expect Mental Stability Growing Up.../n
SiriusXM’s The Opie & Anthony show has chimed in on Paris Jackson’s suicide attempt, doubting the 15-year-old’s sincerity to end her life and raising issues with her unconventional upbringing with the Jackson family since her father Michael’s 2009 death.
“How do you expect mental stability growing up in that f***ing nuthouse?” show member Jim Norton asked Thursday (possibly referring to the family’s well-publicized internal upheaval last summer when grandmother Katherine was whisked away to an Arizona resort, leading to court proceedings that granted cousin T.J. partial custody).
PHOTOS: Paris Jackson Shares Images From Her Schoolgirl Life
Co-host Anthony Cumia was even more blunt in his assessment of the venerated show biz clan, calling them “mental patients” and imploring listeners to “stop with this f***ing hero worship of the dumb Jackson family,” while calling Paris “the new Wacko Jacko.”
The comedy show also called into question how sincere Paris’s attempt to kill herself was, as host Gregg “Opie” Hughes said, “I think over 90 percent of the people [who fail in suicide attempts] are not trying to kill themselves.
PHOTOS: Paris Jackson’s History Of Suspicious Slashes On Her Wrists
“Cause if you’re really trying to kill yourself, there’s so many other ways to do it,” he said. “It’s more you’re screaming for attention — the people that are really trying to kill themselves, they’re the ones jumping off the f***in’ bridges, shooting themselves in the head, hanging themselves knowing that’s its pretty tough to get out of, jumping off the top of a building, walking in front of a train — that’s all way past the, ‘I’m just looking for attention s**t.'”
Their insights come with some heavy life experience, as Norton, 44, admittedly slashed his wrists at 18, saying the drastic move was “for attention” and not an earnest attempt to end his life.
“It was not a true suicide attempt,” the outspoken New Jersey-born funnyman admitted. “I forget I got the [scars] sometimes, it’s embarrassing.”
PHOTOS: Paris Jackson Through The Years
Elsewhere, another comic with a past history of suicide attempts, Artie Lange, send a kind tweet regarding Jackson’s attempt, referring to her quoting the Beatles classic Yesterday prior to the tragic turn.
The Dirty Work star tweeted to the troubled teen, “Paris Jackson. Stay Strong. Make the next Beatles song you quote be ” Here Comes The Sun “. My prayers are with you!”
The Opie & Anthony Show airs weekdays on SiriusXM at 6 am ET.

favorite reality hits, it tackled feminism and the scary manipulation and mental illness you don't usually see on reality shows—what UnREAL creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, a former Bachelor producer, calls "a female Breaking Bad.&q.../n
Lifetime's UnREAL, all about the behind-the-scenes drama of a fictional Bachelor-esque dating show called Everlasting, is going somewhere The Bachelor has not yet dared to go: They're having a black suitor. While ABC's dating competition has notoriously stuck to a very similar type of guy over its 20 seasons (read: white), the cast and producers of UnREAL are excited to tackle race this year."We're not afraid to do anything," says star Constance Zimmer, who plays the manipulative reality producer Quinn. "It's actually really exciting because I do feel like the second season for us means we can kind of go darker. And we can maybe go a little bit further than we might've been afraid to in the first season."Season one went pretty deep. Although it might've sounded like a fluffy, fun show about one of your favorite reality hits, it tackled feminism and the scary manipulation and mental illness you don't usually see on reality shows—what UnREAL creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, a former Bachelor producer, calls "a female Breaking Bad."Shapiro tells E! News that while season one focused on feminism, season two will explore the intersection of feminism and masculinity—all while having a discussion about race through the lens of Everlasting's black suitor.

"I think one thing we've been talking a lot about in the room is who owns their narrative? And the complications of Rachel and Quinn being these white women who decide they're going to take on the race issue on their very complicated, pretty crazy show," she says. While Quinn will love the ratings attention, Rachel (Shiri Appleby) will want to have a serious discussion about race in America."We definitely have different voices in the room representing different points of view on this," she continues, "but I think it's a really complicated issue and that being PC about it sometimes stops us from making progress because we're all too scared to talk about it. It's such a compelling issue in our time right now...and that's something we're passionate about talking about even though we're scared of talking about it."And yes, she is worried about messing up. "I'm terrified! But I just really think we should do it," she says. "I think it's really important."Although a new season of Everlasting means an all-new cast (on the show-within-the-show), there will be at least one familiar face. "There might be one really handsome guy. He might have an accent," teases Shapiro.While she insists that every storyline needs to begin with Rachel or Quinn, it makes sense to bring Freddie Stroma's hot British suitor, Adam, back after his relationship with Rachel ended so abruptly. "That obviously left on a pretty unresolved note for Rachel," she says.Season two of UnREAL returns to Lifetime this summer.

'NCIS' Star Mark Harmon Snubs Ailing Sister/n
Mark Harmon plays a good guy on his hit NCIS crime drama, but in real life the TV investigator is a coldhearted jerk with a history of chasing skirts, insiders tell RadarOnline.com.
The 65-year-old former UCLA quarterback, who plays Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs on the world’s most-watched drama, is far from the “fair-minded hero he plays on TV,” says a source.
“Mark can be a total jerk!”
Currently, his dirt-poor sister Kristin Nelson, 72, is recovering from a serious illness in Los Angeles after being released from a Santa Fe hospital. But Mark has so far refused to visit her or to even pick up the phone.
PHOTOS:Mark Harmon’s Heart Attack Nightmare — NCIS Star Not Photographed In Public For 250 Days
“Kristin is nearly destitute,” a source spills. “She got a small inheritance from her mother who died in 2012, but that money’s virtually gone now.
“Mark is worth millions. He won’t kick in a penny to help her out.”
The star’s bitterness stems from the late 1980’s when he tried to take away Kristin’s kid using the power of his pocketbook, celebrity and high-powered lawyers — only to mysteriously drop his lawsuit under suspicious circumstances.
PHOTOS: The Top 20 Reality TV Paychecks Revealed
In 1987, the former St. Elsewhere star and his Mork & Mindy wife Pam Dawber hauled widow Kristin, whose husband was pop star Ricky Nelson, into court on claims she was doing drugs around her son Sam.
Kristin vehemently denied it under oath.
She still might have lost her child, but Mark shockingly dropped the suit at the 11th hour just before Pam, who was secretly four weeks pregnant with their first child, was to be grilled about her own drug use. Pam insisted she didn’t do drugs.

At the time, Kristin’s lawyer claimed Mark’s decision to drop the case was “unconditional surrender.”
Months later, Pam was crushed by the murder of Rebecca Schaeffer, her 21-year-old co-star in the hit sitcom My Sister Sam.
She was gunned down at the door of her L.A. apartment in July 1989 by a crazed fan who’d paid a private investigator to get her address.
“Pam took Rebecca’s vicious murder very hard,” says a source. “To her and Mark, it was truly like a death in the family.”

Mark believes death stalks him because months later, on March 15, 1990, his dad Tom, a Heisman Trophy winner and World War II hero-turned-sportscaster, suffered a massive heart attack after winning a golf tournament at Bel-Air Country Club. He was rushed to UCLA Medical Center, where he died.
“Losing his father in an instant like that, when he seemed the picture of health, still rattles him to this day,” said our insider.
“For a time in 2015, at seemingly the height of his fame on NCIS, he seriously mulled calling it quits to be with Pam and their two kids.”
Amazingly, family man Mark is also hiding a wild womanizing past. As a young actor, he plunged into sizzling affairs with a bevy of Tinseltown beauties. His list of conquests includes Knots Landing starlet Donna Mills, singer Karen Carpenter and Flamingo Road co–star Cristina Raines!
At the time, Mills described Mark as catnip to women, gushing: “Forget Mel Gibson. Whenever I see Mark, I think to myself, ‘Your place or mine?’ ”
Even Mark confessed while playing rakish Dr. Robert Caldwell on St. Elsewhere, “Women would come up to me and show me their breasts and ask for my opinion. And I gave it to them!”

Looks like Ashley Tisdale is a Swiftie once again!
As we previously reported, the High School Musical alum seemingly took shots at Taylor Swift's latest diss track, Look What You Made Me Do. Uh oh!

In a series of since deleted tweets, the 32-year-old wrote: 

"Music is supposed to bring us together. It's supposed to unite us. When we have artists targeting each other for the sake of controversy… The art suffers. When will try to stop bringing each other down and start lifting us up when we live in a world that's doing exactly that?"
So shady!
While Miz Tisdale attempted to down play the drama by claiming the posts were not "about one person," the controversy clearly hasn't subsided for the former Disney darling as she made quite the online gesture on Monday. Following the release of the Look What You Made Me Do visual, the industry vet posted:

Blake Lively has nothing but wonderful things to say about Woody Allen.The actress has come to the controversial director's defense before, and during her latest interview with Hamptons magazine, she continued to gush about Allen and her experience working with him on her upcoming film Café Society, which costars Jesse Eisenberg, Steve Carell, and Parker Posey."[Woody] creates a very pleasant set where everybody's just happy to be there and happy to be making a movie, and happy to be a part of film history," she said. "For him to have that confidence in you almost gives you the confidence in yourself to just go with the flow. And those are the moments that he really likes, the found moments, the moments that aren't written but just happen."

She continued, "It's really cool to work with a director who's done so much, because he knows exactly what he wants. The fact that he does one shot for an entire scene—[and] this could be a scene with eight people and one to two takes—it gives you a level of confidence because when he's got it, he knows he's got it."Lively added that Allen will give his actors free rein to improvise in scenes, which can be a daunting task. "He also is really encouraging as to why he cast you, so he'll say, 'Say the dialogue that's written and then you can improvise for a while.' And his dialogue is so specific, and it's speaking in a 1930s dialect and [with period] references, so it's intimidating to think, Oh, let me just improvise there and hope that my words blend seamlessly alongside Woody Allen's. Which they clearly wouldn't and don't. But he's very empowering."

What Sophia Bush Wishes She Could Tell Her 20-Year-Old Self About Beauty
/n
Credit: Michael Simon
Sophia Bush‘s career got a jump start when she dropped out of the University of Southern California at age 21 to join the hit TV show One Tree Hill, and it hasn’t slowed down since. And while she admits she’s been fortunate to have a steady job in TV for the past 13 years, for a while, the star struggled with taking time for herself until she started working on her latest series, Chicago P.D. 
“For me, having a conversation about self-care and taking some of the pressure off is deeply important right now. I wish I had known prioritizing myself was okay earlier on,” Bush told PeopleStyle at the Unlock Your bold launch event celebrating Listerine’s new collection of guided meditations on the Inscape app. “I started going to set 30 minutes earlier than they needed me so I could sit in my trailer by myself after hair and makeup, put my headphones in and do a meditation app.”

Even simple, small moments, like taking 30 seconds during her lunch break on set to freshen up created a snowball effect towards positive, healthy change in the star’s life. “I take 30 seconds to reset while I swish Listerine. [It’s] matter of professional courtesy — which is especially important for my interrogation scenes — and also a small moment of mindfulness for me,” she said. “You don’t have to move to Bali for six months and become a yogi to feel centered!”

Bush also revealed that at 34 years old, she’s reached a point in her life where she doesn’t stress about what anyone thinks of her choices fashion-wise, especially noting her bold hot pink monochromatic look at the SAG Awards this past January.

“I don’t take fashion all that seriously. Don’t get me wrong, I love it, but I don’t think it’s rocket science. I don’t think we’re going to break something in the universe if no one likes my look,” Bush said. “[When I was younger], I wish I hadn’t been so nervous about making sure everybody liked me.”
The risks she’s taking are already paying off. The star said she was quite proud to be one of the women that paved the way early on for the pink eye makeup trend, which was created by makeup artist Patrick Ta for the award show. “Now everyone is wearing pink!” Bush said. “I was like, ‘Patrick Ta! You and me started a trend!'”

 Reality Check! Former Danbury Inmate Says Diva Teresa Giudice Needs An Attitude Adjustment.../n
The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice will be locked away in prison for more than a year. How will the TV diva survive? According to a former inmate of the same correctional facility, she needs a serious reality check!
“My advice to Teresa is to maintain as low a profile as possible,” former long-term Danbury inmate Beatrice Codianni tells RadarOnline.com exclusively.
“If the other inmates are picking on Teresa, which they might do because of her celebrity status, do not do anything that will get you more time in there,” says Codianni, who served a 14 year sentence at Danbury, Connecticut’s federal prison after being convicted on racketeering charges.
PHOTOS: Top Earning Real Housewives
“I just hope she just keeps her focus and doesn’t let anyone say or do anything to her that will get her upset and set her off because the first thing they will take away from her are her visitation rights.”
Joe Giudice, 43, Teresa’s husband of 43-years, was sentenced to a 41-month prison stint that will begin after Teresa’s release. The unusual scheduling was arranged to accommodate the couple’s four daughters Gia, 13, Gabriella, 9, Milania, 8, and Audriana, 5, and Codianni says that Teresa’s children should be her primary focus right now.
“When her Joe and the girls come to visit, Teresa needs to make sure to tell her kids something positive about her stay. She needs to let them know she is okay by saying that she has made friends, or saw a beautiful sunset. She needs to comfort the girls so they are not more traumatized than they already are by all of this.”

“She must think about her family life while she is inside Danbury and she needs to concentrate on keeping herself and her family together through this,” says Codianni, who is now the Managing Editor for Reentry Central, a leading national website for information related to re-entry into society and related criminal justice issues.
“Teresa Giudice has a date and she has an out,” she adds. “A lot of women in there do not have that. She needs to just do whatever they tell her to do so she can get the he** out of there.”

Mama June Shannon’s Trainer Shares the Workout Routine that Helped Her Achieve Her Weight-Loss Goals/n

Is she faking it?

 MORE >>





Mama June Shannon’s trainer Kenya Crooks offered a look at the workout routine and the diet changes that helped the Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star slim down to a size four.

Mama June, who underwent bariatric weight-loss surgery after losing some weight on her own, enlisted the help of Crooks to make positive improvements in her day-to-day lifestyle. The trainer told Women’s Health that he began by asking the reality star what she wanted to improve and “make sexier.”
“I believe language is very important when trying to help a client. I never say ‘What don’t you like about yourself?’ because that’s negative and defeated language,” Crooks said. “Mama June wanted to lose weight and tone up at the same time, so that was the mission.”
They worked out together two to three times a week, either in person or via Skype. Elbow crunches, reaching sit-ups, and Russian twists with a medicine ball were some of the key core exercises that were included in the routine, which you can find at the top of the page.

As far as Mama June’s diet was concerned, Crooks said that he stressed lean meats, vegetables, and fruits.
“When you decide to lose weight, you have to be a little selfish and focused all the time,” Crooks adds. “Mama June is a giver, and it’s hard for her to say ‘no’ sometimes. I had to remind her that this is her time. I had to say, ‘You can’t be everything to everybody else and be nothing to yourself.’ Once she gave herself permission to put herself first, she was fine.'”

Teresa Giudice’s Lawyer Blasts Claims She’s Cheating on Husband Joe: ‘This Is the Embodiment of Fake News’/n
Even though Teresa Giudice is separated physically from her husband, Joe, as he serves out a 41-month prison sentence, the reality star insists she has remained faithful.
Despite recent reports claiming the Real Housewives of New Jersey has stepped out on Joe as he serves time for bankruptcy fraud at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey, Teresa’s lawyer James J. Leonard tells PEOPLE that speculation about any estrangement or infidelity between the spouses, both 45, is “the embodiment of fake news.”
Leonard says “manufactured” stories about the parents of four “all sizzle and no steak. Sadly, Teresa is used to this. She and her family have been a target of these types of attacks for years.”
A source close to the show also tells PEOPLE “There’s no truth in [any suggestion of] an affair.”
Leonard adds that the couple “speak every day” and that “Teresa saw Joe two weeks ago and will be seeing him this weekend for Father’s Day. “
RELATED VIDEO: Joe Giudice Reveals Post-Prison Plans with Wife Teresa: ‘We’ll Be Spending a lot of Time in the Bedroom’

 
The Giudices were both convicted of bankruptcy fraud in October 2014 and allowed to serve time separately. Joe’s prison stint came just months after Teresa was released on Dec. 23, 2015 after a nearly 11-month sentence.
In October of last year, rumors of Joe’s infidelity continued to spread on an episode of RHONJ when boutique owner Kim D. resurfaced the allegations — suggesting Joe had been unfaithful to Teresa during her 11-month prison stay with a mysterious “blonde” and a number of “brunettes.”
But speaking exclusively with PEOPLE in February 2016, both Teresa and Joe denied the allegations, and the RHONJ star vowed that her husband had an implicit trust that when he went to prison, she would be faithful to him.
“I have single friends so if I’m going to be out and if there’s people around us and if there’s men around us, I’m not going to be like, ‘Oh my God, stay away from us, I’m afraid somebody is going to take a picture of us.’ I’m just going to live my life,” Teresa said at the time. “Joe trusts me, he knows I’m faithful, I know he’s faithful and that’s all that matters.”
“We’ve been married 16 years. Listen, we’re both devoted to each other, and I don’t have a collar around his neck,” she added. “If we didn’t want to be around each other we would both go our separate ways.”
Teresa has been married to Joe since 1999 and shares daughters Gia, 16, Gabriella, 12, Milania, 11, and Audriana, 7, with the businessman.
FROM PEN: Andy Cohen’s Pick For The Most Absurd ‘Real Housewives’ Business Ever

In the time since the couple was sentenced to each serving time in prison, they both have functioned as single parents while caring for their girls.
This past September, Teresa told PEOPLE that while it’s emotionally difficult to be apart from Joe — who is not a citizen of the United States and could be sent back to his native Italy at the end of his prison sentence — her children are managing to carry on.
“They’re doing good,” she said of her daughters. “I’m sure it wasn’t easy, but a little easier because they went through it with me so they know what to expect. But they miss him tremendously, they always say we miss dad. They miss him. You can feel his absence, our family’s definitely incomplete without him.”
“What keeps me busy is my girls. I swear, that’s what makes the days go by. If I didn’t have them, I’d probably go crazy,” she admitted. “Then I would really think about him 24/7 and it wouldn’t be easy. That’s what he said, too: ‘That’s what got me through the day was the girls. They kept me busy.’ And that’s how I am, I’m going through the motions of each day. I just can’t wait for each day to pass by for him to come home.”
The Real Housewives of New Jersey returns to Bravo this summer, and Teresa’s second memoir, Standing Strong, will be available this summer.

 'Unexplained & Sudden': Officials Say No Drugs Found At Peaches Geldof Home,.../n
We’ve got all of Tuesday’s latest developments in what authorities are calling the “unexplained and sudden” death of Peaches Geldof at just 25, right here on RadarOnline.com.
‘No Drugs’
Police, squashing rampant media speculation, said no drugs were recovered at the socialite’s home, nor a suicide note. The mother-of-two — her young sons Astala Dylan Willow and Phaedra Bloom Forever are 23 months and 11 months, respectively — had no physical marks on her person, officials said. The U.K. Sun reported that coroner’s officials are examining whether the premature death can be attributed to natural causes.

Last Public Sighting, Social Media Correspondence
Geldof’s last foray into the limelight came at a London fashion show earlier this month for Tesco’s F&F brand. On Sunday between 5:58 PM and 6:17 PM local time, Geldof posted seven shots of her family to her Instagram, four of her infant son Phaedra, the last one of she and her late mother Paula Yates, titled, “Me and my mum.”

The Last Interview
Geldof, in her last interview, vowed to be a committed mother to her two sons, words that rang especially powerful after her mother’s drug overdose death in 2000. “I am not about to let them down, not for anyone or anything,” she told Mother & Baby in the chat, which was centered on the attachment parenting craze she had fully embraced. She said that her newfound parenthood gave her a strong sense of identity. “Becoming a mother was like becoming me, finally. After years of struggling to know myself, feeling lost at sea, rudderless and troubled, having babies through which to correct the multiple mistakes of my own traumatic childhood was beyond healing. I felt finally anchored in place, with lives that literally depend on me, and I am not about to let them down, not for anyone or anything.”

‘Beyond Pain’
The late model’s famous father Bob Geldof issued a statement on behalf of the family, saying, “Peaches has died. We are beyond pain. She was the wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us. Writing ‘was’ destroys me afresh. What a beautiful child. How is this possible that we will not see her again? How is that bearable? We loved her and will cherish her forever.” The latter was signed by Bob, Jeanne, Fifi, Pixie and Tiger Geldof. As we previously reported, the English fashionista was found at her home in Wrotham, Kent Monday.

Khloe Kardashian's Ex James Harden Tells All On Rocky Relationship/n
James Harden “didn’t like all the attention” that came along with dating Khloe Kardashian, which he claims ultimately led to their split last year.
In a new interview with Sports Illustrated, the 27-year-old revealed new secrets of the pair’s high-profile relationship, sharing that it wasn’t his bag.
“I feel like [the attention] was for no reason,” the Houston Rockets said. “I wasn’t getting anything out of it except my name out there and my face out there, and I don’t need that. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t me. I don’t need pictures of myself when I’m driving my car. Who cares? What shoes am I wearing? Who cares? Where am I eating? Who cares? It was unnecessary stuff that I think trickled down to my teammates. I had to eliminate that.”

As Radar readers know, Harden and Kardashian split in February 2016 after eight months of dating. Soon after their breakup, 32-year-old Khloe threw Harden under the bus on her now-cancelled show Kocktails With Khloe, claiming that he cheated on her.
“He sought me out, he wanted to be committed…then wasn’t committed,” Khloe revealed in the juicy new video.
The reality star explained that she offered not to be monogamous when they began dating, due to their complicated schedules and long distance relationship, but Harden wouldn’t have it.

“I was like ‘Great, this guy’s in it for the long haul,” Khloe said. “‘Let’s do it.’ [Then I] found out he wasn’t,” she revealed, adding that she has “the receipts to prove it.”
As for Harden, the athlete told Sports Illustrated that he’s happy to focus solely on his career right now. “I’m not worried about anything but hooping,” he said. “And that may be why I’m having this kind of success.”

Prince's Tragic Death Spurs Ugly Feud: Family Members To Fight Over Fortune/n
Sadly, Prince‘s tragic death has not brought his loved ones together in mourning. Instead, his family members are beginning to feud over the music icon’s reported $300 million fortune, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
A will for the late singer — who was discovered dead  in an elevator at his Minnesota estate on Thursday morning at just 57 years old — has not turned up, leaving his siblings scrambling for a piece of the massive “Purple Rain” pie, sources claim.
“There will be a fight,” the insider tells Radar.

Prince’s parents, John Nelson and Mattie Shaw, who split when their famous son was just 10, have also passed away.

New month, new hair.

Cara Delevingne debuted a seriously white-hot ‘do when she stepped out with pal Kendall Jenner over the weekend. Hitting the town for Paris Fashion Week, the model was spotted rocking a platinum blonde layered bob, which contrasted her signature bold, brown brows.
The 24-year-old was last spotted with golden tresses. The word’s still out if this new color is for the runway or a new movie role, or if Delevingne is just having some fun with hair dye.

Nicole Curtis Rallies Fans to Support a Friend's Daughter Battling Cancer: 'This Is a 9-Year-Old That Should be Playing and Laughing'
/n
Known for saving old houses, HGTV’s Nicole Curtis is now focusing on saving a young life.
The Rehab Addict star has been speaking out on social media about a 9-year-old girl named Tessa who’s suffering from stage 4 Neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that occurs most often in infants and young children, according to BeatNB.org.
“We are asking for prayers and for support for our friends because this is the hardest thing we’ve ever endured,” Curtis tells PEOPLE of her passion for the cause. “No child should have to suffer the likes of cancer.”
The TV host and author was first introduced to Tessa through the girl’s father, Bobby, who is now Curtis’ lead builder. Hearing about his daughter’s illness, Curtis, a mother of two, explains, was incredibly difficult: “I kept it together and walked until I was out of sight and then ran to my truck,” she writes in a post on Facebook. “I cried and cried. That moment still hits me like a ton of bricks.”

Eager to help, Curtis offered to give the profits from the sale of a home she’d renovated to Tessa’s family. She met Tessa for the first time at the open house for the property, which she says had record attendance of over 4,000 people. Later, the family — also including Tessa’s mom Karin, her sister Marley, 3, and her 6-month-old brother, Jay — received a home makeover from Curtis, which appeared on two episodes of her HGTV show. She and others involved in Tessa’s efforts also came together to organize a community yard sale, a T-shirt drive and a #welovetessa hashtag campaign, as well as a crowd funding effort to raise funds and awareness for the family.
Curtis isn’t the only celebrity to stand behind Tessa, either. On the “Team Tessa” Facebook page, a post featuring a screenshot of the young girl FaceTiming with Katy Perry thanks the pop star for, “making Tessa’s dream come true.”

She ain’t yo average chick.

Beyoncé fans are in an uproar after a photo of the singer’s wax figure at Madame Tussauds in New York City went viral. The statue — which was recently put back at the venue after a stint at another location, according to the museum’s Twitter — received much backlash for supposedly looking nothing like the “Hold Up” songstress.
Many fans criticized Madame Tussauds for lightening Bey’s skin and thinning out her signature curves. “This is a melanin-defunct, lipless, thickless Bey,” one Twitter user wrote.
Needless to say, the Beehive was not kind…

Authorities ID Another Victim of ‘Killer Clown’ John Wayne Gacy: ‘My Brother Somehow Ran Into Him’/n
A 16-year-old boy who had left his Minnesota home bound for Chicago 41 years ago has been newly identified as a victim of serial killer John Wayne Gacy — the “killer clown” who murdered at least 33 teenage boys and young men between 1972 and 1978 in Illinois’ Cook County.
According to a statement from the Cook County Sheriff’s Department, 16-year-old Jimmy Haakenson last spoke to his mother on Aug. 5, 1976, and told her he made it to Chicago.
Haakenson was among the eight unidentified victims recovered from a crawl space in Gacy’s home in 1978, officials announced Wednesday. They believe he may have been killed within weeks of leaving home.
Investigators said Gacy — who had performed at children’s parties as “Pogo the Clown” — killed the 16-year-old, but they know little else about Haakenson’s death.
Dozens of bodies were found stacked in Gacy’s residence outside Chicago, and recent advancements in DNA technology have helped investigators close a long-lingering missing persons case that had gone cold.
Authorities said that Haakenson’s nephew, curious about his uncle, learned of the department’s efforts to identify Gacy’s victims and reached out to investigators to supply his DNA.

Gacy was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 young men — some of whom he tortured or sexually assaulted after he lured them to his home — and he was executed by lethal injection in 1994.
Haakenson is the second of Gacy’s eight unknown victims to be identified. Investigators have spent the last six years attempting to bring closure to the families of men missing from the area, who may have made the fatal mistake of crossing paths with Gacy.
The eight bodies were exhumed and DNA samples were taken from the families of missing men. The first body identified was William Bundy, a 19-year-old construction worker from Chicago.
Officials said Haakenson’s family were relieved to at last know his fate. They will be traveling to Chicago to mark his unnamed grave, which reportedly has the phrase “we remembered.” Haakenson’s mother, who passed away in 2005, suspected her son may have been among Gacy’s victims, according to authorities.
“This man was a horrible monster, and my brother somehow ran into him,” Haakenson’s older sister told the Pioneer Press. “Somehow, on the bus or on a street corner, just being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Six bodies remained unidentified.

For every Jennifer Hudson, there’s a William Hung, and on Thursday’s edition of American Idol documenting the show’s Los Angeles auditions, many of the oddballs featured vied for the title of this season’s “What were they thinking?” contestant.
Tynisha Roches, a 25-year-old Hoboken, New Jersey native, belted out a cringe-worthy rendition of Frank Sinatra’s My Way, then began singing a second song (Whitney Houston’s And I’m Telling You I’m Not Going) when judge Randy Jackson picked up and left the room. Of course, a singing Roches followed him, prompting Jackson to call for security, who hauled her out.

Julia Roberts and longtime co-star George Clooney will soon share something special in common: He too will be a parent to twins. The actor's wife Amal Clooney is pregnant with a baby boy and a girl, who are due in June. Roberts said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Friday that she has given George advice about parenthood but did not say what she told him."It's gonna be so fun. They are a great couple and I think they don't need advice from me or anybody else," she said.She did, however, paint a 100 percent accurate picture of what parenthood is like for the first few weeks."Also, you know, nobody's there with you at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're just going, 'What am I doing? Where did they come from and when are they going?'" she said. "And then you sort of, you get through it and you figure it out and everybody does and it's a trial and error and a whole lot of tears and it's amazing."

E! News had previously learned the Clooneys plan on raising their children in the U.K., where Amal has lived for years and where the couple owns one of their homes. The couple has also decided that after the twins come home, they won't hire a live-in or full-time nanny and instead have a night nurse help set a sleeping schedule. Amal's mother, journalist Baria Alamuddin, has also expressed that she would like to help out.

George has signaled diaper duty is something he can handle."Hang on for a minute. I played a pediatrician on ER," Clooney told E! News' Marc Malkin in March.

One Direction may be on a hiatus, but that doesn’t mean Niall Horan isn’t keeping in touch with his bandmates.

The “Slow Hands” singer tells Billboard he’s still very close with the remaining members. Though Harry Styles is now a solo artist and Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson have become fathers, Horan says he’ll always have a soft spot in his heart for the 1D boys.
“I see Louis and [his son] little Freddie all the time. He lives around the corner from me [in Los Angeles],” he shares, adding he’s also picked gifts for Payne’s newborn son with Cheryl Cole, though he hasn’t been able to present them yet due to conflicting schedules.

“I really enjoyed them,” Horan says of Styles’ new songs. “He’s smashin’ it.”
As for Zayn Malik, the man who made One Direction into a foursome with his 2015 departure, he has nothing but love for but the “Pillowtalk” crooner. In fact, despite Malik’s recent criticisms against his former group, Horan believes the former boy bander will reunite with them eventually.
“Oh, pfft. I know what Zayn’s like — outspoken, and fair play to him,” the 23-year-old quips. “When it will be, I don’t know. I ­prefer not to do it after I’m 40. I’d prefer the next few years.”
“We haven’t even had a ­conversation about how long we think the break will be,” he adds. “I told my ­managers from the start: When One Direction comes knocking, fook what I’m doing. I don’t give a shit if I sold out arenas or won Grammys. I wouldn’t be doing this if it wasn’t for that.”

Prince Charles Believes His Father Bullied Him Into Marrying Princess Diana/n
Prince Charles believed his father bullied him into marrying Diana, according to a new book, The Sun has reported.
Sally Bedell Smith, author of the upcoming biography, Prince Charles: The Passions And Paradoxes Of An Improbable Life, says in 1980, while he and Diana were dating, rumors flew that sullied her honor—and Prince Charles’ father Prince Philip was not amused.
Tongues wagged after news surfaced that the couple had spent a night together on the royal train.
PHOTOS: Never Forgotten! Princess Kate Makes Touching Tribute To Diana At Royal Event
According to Smith, Prince Philip became gravely concerned that the then-19-year-old Diana’s honor “had been impugned” and wrote his son a letter saying that Diana’s “reputation was on the line.” He urged Prince Charles to make up his mind on whether to propose to the teen or not, Smith wrote.
Charles, now 68, chose to interpret his dad’s letter as “coercive and accusatory,” the book says.
Philip’s cousin Pamela Hicks said, “Charles read it as: ‘You’ve got to get engaged.’

“He wasn’t in love. He wasn’t ready. He saw it as a ghastly threat,” Hicks claimed.
Smith, the bestselling author of Elizabeth the Queen, wrote that Charles, still the heir to the throne as his mother continues to rule at 90, was emotionally stunted.
While still wed to Diana, he was “riven with anxieties over his marriage and bleak future,” she said.
Prince Charles and Princess Diana, who wed in 1981, were officially divorced in 1996. Diana died in a car accident with her lover Dodi Fayed at age 36 in 1997.
In 2005, Charles married his longtime mistress Camilla Parker Bowles, 69, but Smith’s biography claims that the Prince has cheated on her, too. /n

“A stunt driver has died on the set of Deadpool during a stunt on a motorcycle,” Vancouver Police share in a statement via Twitter.

“Our hearts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of our crew member during this difficult time,” said a network spokesperson.
Weeks before the incident, Harris had shared a photo of herself via Facebook saying “EVERYTHING FOR A REASON. #staythecourse.”

Her wrist had just healed after a violent injury, and she was ready to go back to work as the hit film’s stuntwoman.

Callie and Arizona's Custody Battle Is Just Beginning on Grey's Anatomy and It's Already Getting Ugly Things between Callie and Arizona are about to get a whole lot worse. The minute Callie jumped the gun and presented her ex-.../n
Things between Callie and Arizona are about to get a whole lot worse.The minute Callie jumped the gun and presented her ex-wife with potential schools for their daughter across the country at the start of tonight's episode of Grey's Anatomy, we knew her pipe dream of moving Sofia to New York to follow Penny wasn't going to fly with Arizona. But we didn't know we'd be in full-blown custody battle mode by episode's end. Seriously, why doesn't anyone think about what they're doing before they do it on this show?!

After their conversation over coffee came to a crashing halt, each of the exes headed into work and whined to their respective sympathetic ears. Penny told Callie that she couldn't step in and offer advice because it wasn't her place yet. And Richard, surprised that Arizona had already consulted with that lawyer, told her to slow down and consider whether she was overreacting. And that seemed to work. Callie came to her senses and was ready to admit that she'd gotten ahead of herself, but all it took was one ill-timed phone call to send Arizona over the edge.It turns out that Callie had already submitted an application for Sofia at the Barton Academy, completely undermining her promise to Arizona to not make plans without her. If that tense final face-to-face with the pair over Arizona's lawyer's card is any indication, Grey Sloan Memorial is about to be a battlefield.Spare Parts:- Ben's already antsy in his punishment, showing little remorse and cavalierly looking to get back into the OR by returning to his anesthesiologist position. That he went through with it even after Miranda expressly told him he "better figure out where [he's] gonna sleep" if he did doesn't not bode well for this marriage. Homeboy needs to check himself before he wrecks himself even more.- The young shooting victim case was incredibly sad and shook up much of the staff in unexpected ways. Maggie's freak out over how much she loves Mer's kids was a really sweet moment, as was Jo's realization that she didn't need the gun she was hiding from Alex to feel safe anymore.- Kyle is going to die, right? There's no way that he's not going to die. Poor Edwards.- "We're becoming cat ladies. And the children are our cats." Hands down, funniest line of the night.Grey's Anatomy airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Playboy's Halloween Headquarters Decorations/nPlayboy employees livened up their Beverly Hills offices by decking out their cubicles with some dead-on decorations ... and yes, that's partly a reference to Anna Nicole Smith. There's a huge hole to fill in the Playboy universe because the Mansion's annual Halloween bash was canceled this year -- so Playmates Kennedy Summers, Stephanie Branton and Miriam Gonzalez got their kicks at the corporate office instead. The ladies judged the staff's Halloween decorations, which you can see for yourself in the gallery. Along with a tribute to  "Stranger Things " and a Playmates graveyard ... there was a  "dead " strip club with a  "coked-up " champagne room. Trump even showed up.

“[Three years ago] I came on and I was pregnant and it went so well, and I said to my husband, ‘I’m going on Fallon, you know what that means — gotta get pregnant!’” she joked during her August appearance.
While the couple hopes to stop and take a breath with their new baby on board, it seems to be another busy year for the duo. Larter’s show Legends was renewed for a second season, while MacArthur signed on for the upcoming TBS comedy Angie Tribeca.​ /n

Michelle Rodriguez may have starred in five Fast and the Furious movies, but she’s ready to walk away from the franchise if things don’t change.

The actress celebrated the digital release of The Fate of the Furious by threatening to leave the series. In an Instagram post, Michelle wrote she “might have to say goodbye to a loved franchise” if better material isn’t provided to the female cast.
“F8 is out digitally today, I hope they decide to show some love to the women of the franchise on the next one. Or I just might have to say goodbye to a loved franchise,” she captioned a photo collage of her co-stars. “It’s been a good ride & Im grateful for the opportunity the fans & studio have provided over the years… One Love.”



A post shared by Michelle Rodriguez (@mrodofficial) on Jun 27, 2017 at 8:43am PDT



While Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, and Gal Gadot have joined the franchise in recent years, Michelle believes the films are still primarily dominated by men.
“It does weigh heavy on my head — especially in the male-dominated environment that I work in,” told Entertainment Weekly earlier this year. “At the end of the day, the only leverage I have as an individual is my participation. That’s the only leverage I ever use with anything. It’s like, look, this doesn’t agree with my ethics, morals. My heart doesn’t feel right doing this in front of millions of people, so I can always oblige myself and depart because money, to me, isn’t as important as my lines that you’re not allowed to cross.”

'RHOC' Star Tamra Blames Husband Eddie For Ruined Relationship With Daughter/n
In episode seven of the Real Housewives of Orange County, Tamra Judge steals the spotlight from her fellow wives when she admits she may be blaming husband Eddie Judge for her broken relationship with her daughter.
In this week’s clip, Judge’s drama is front and center, not only with her estranged child but with Vicki Gunvalson and the newest housewife, Peggy Sulahian, as well.
In Gunvalson’s first appearance, she begins by ripping Shannon Beador for her weight gain. “Shannon needs to stop blaming me for her problems. I have no fricking idea why Shannon is blaming me for her problems?”
She says with spite. “I’m flattered that Shannon thinks of me when she’s eating her food and not exercising.”

Meghan Edmonds makes a brief appearance in the Bravo episode, yet her strained marriage with Jim Edmonds is evident throughout. “Jimmy’s a little bit softer now that baby Aspen’s been born. Jimmy is really sweet and sensitive and thoughtful. The time when he’s not being a huge asshole he’s so sweet,” she says about her husband.
Showing off their money in true OC style, Lydia McLaughlin‘s husband buys her not one but two cars for her birthday, a mom-mobile SUV Infiniti QX80 for $90,000 and later an Astin Martin D89 for a whopping $180,000. He even upped the bling with some $3,500 Gianelle Wheels.
“Doug goes over the top,” she says. “Money is meant to be spent.”

She, however, still would not stop talking about his vasectomy!
“I am planning a good by balls party. I love his balls and I feel like they deserve to be celebrated.”
The screen then flashes to a wealthy Sulahian bragging about her kids and trying to praise them for their good work ethic: “Our kids don’t have to work. What I love is that they choose to work.”

The scene then changes to Tamra and Eddie on a date night, which turns sour when she drops the major bombshell that she blames him for the fact that her daughter, Sidney Simon, refuses to speak to her.
She continues, telling her husband that her mother not coming to her estranged children gala crushed her.
“My mom knows the pain and the hurt that I’ve gone through. And for her not to be there, it hurts. I don’t think you understand when I grew up we didn’t talk about shit. This whole three and a half, four years that I’ve been dealing with this, my mom has never said ‘I’ll call Sidney and try to get to the bottom of this.’ If this was Ava doing it to Ryan I wouldn’t give up. It’s like sudden death.  Here you have a child in your life and all of a sudden they walk out the door and you don’t see them again.”

Eddie tries to make his wife feel better, telling her “It’s nothing you did,” but she shocks him with her confession.
“It could just be a coincidence. But the truth of the matter is she left four months after we got married. Now my dad ended up marrying my mom’s best friend. I felt like he was choosing this woman over our family.”
Eddie asks her “Do you think Sidney felt like that about you and me?” and a weepy Tamra says “Even tough she thinks you’re good for me, I think maybe it could have been too much. Maybe that’s what pushed her over the edge, maybe I was too wrapped up in my new relationship and my wedding and I just didn’t give her the attention that she needed. Maybe if I just stayed married to Simon I wouldn’t be going through this.”

Her loyal husband tries to reassure her that things will get better. “You can’t change the past. It’s just a matter of time when you’re going to have a relationship with her again. You gotta be patient.”
An unhappy Tamra replies: “I don’t really have a choice.”
The attention later turns to Kelly Dodd and her miserable marriage. “Now that I’m 41 and he’s damn near 60 he wants to stay home and I still want to have fun,” she says of her husband.

Beador’s dinner with her family is the next disaster on the show. Her pained-looking husband, David Beador is disinterested and shows no respect for her as she struggles to make a healthy meal, instead taunting her by shoving chips in his mouth with a blank stare on his face as she cooks.
“I cannot tell you how frustrating it is when you work to get a healthy meal on the table and your husband crams chips in his mouth.”
She reveals that she is hoping to open a restaurant with “affordable, healthy food that is calorie-driven.”

David is skeptical after she tells him it is a “unique concept: affordable healthy market. We might not make the profit margin that normal restaurants would make.”
“You have to have profitability to sustain yourself,” he tells her and she is disappointed by his lack of encouragement.
The spotlight flashes back to Judge, who calls her mother on the phone and talks about the time she missed her gala.

“I had planned on going,” her mom says as she breaks down crying. “This whole things is so hard for me. I wanted to be there. I can’t do this anymore. I mean it’s almost worse than a death,” she says about her estranged granddaughter Sidney.
“Because she’s there and we can’t get to her. I keep praying and praying and praying and God doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t fix anything. Every time I get my hopes up I get slammed right back down again. I promise you if you ever get this opportunity again I will 100 percent be there.”
A tearful judge admits: “Divorce just destroys families. I turned my back on my family because I didn’t like how he was dealing with the divorce. I do feel that Sidney is doing the exact same thing to me.”

The drunken fireworks finally explode at McLaughlin’s Noblemen magazine launch party.
“I want to support Lydia. But I want Tamra and Shannon to know they’re not intimidating me,” says Gunvalson. “They’re not going to make me feel not welcome. They’re like two little ants that go everywhere I am. Ugh!”
Judge wants nothing to do with Gunvalson either.
“I don’t even want to make eye contact with Vicki. If I have to walk around my elbow to get to my a** so I don’t have to look at Vicki I’m going to do it!”
PHOTOS: The Ultimate Betrayal! Tamra FAKES Truce With Vicki
McLaughlin tries to play peacemaker with Judge, telling her Gunvalson “is ready to move on.”
“I love Tamra and Vicki and I love them together. They were like sisters and now they can’t even look at each other. In my mind they’re family to each other. In my mind they’re like sisters,” McLaughlin explains.
“These girls are bugging me,” Gunvalson tells Dodd. “They’re giving me dirty looks,” and as she walks away Beador points to her and says she no longer cares about her. “She doesn’t exist anymore.”

Even though Judge agrees to meet with Gunvalson, she has no faith in the McLaughlin set up meeting. “Oh, Lydia. So naïve. She doesn’t understand everything that’s happened. In my head Vicki’s dead.”
Sulahian tries to defuse Judge’s growing anger against Gunvalson, but winds up being attacked by her.
“She attacked my husband, she attacked my marriage. She attacked Meghan’s husband,” Judge tells her, and Sulahian responds: “It’s not worth it. You’re dwelling on it.”

“Are you kidding me?” Judge screams. “Do you want to be friends? I’ve been friends with her for 10 years. She attacked my husband!”
Sulahian has no time for Judge’s hysterics. “I want to have compassion for Tamra. Woman move on. Move on!”
A seemingly boozed up Judge and Beador begin talking. “I’m f*****g pissed,” Judge says, and they leave in their limo.

“What the f**k did she just say to me?” she asks about Sulahian.
“She has a b***h a** attitude. Why am I defending myself?”
Judge says. “You don’t know me and you don’t know Vicki Gunvalson.”
When Judge tells Beador that Sulahian had a double mastectomy from breast cancer, Beador is instantly suspicious.
“She had breast cancer? Makes sense that Vicki would glom onto Peggy,” she says, invoking the Brooks Ayers fake cancer scandal.
“F**k me, the woman that lied about cancer.”

When it comes to fitness, Guy Ritchie thinks Charlie Hunnam is all talk.That's not to say he doesn't think he's in good shape—anyone with a set of eyes can see that the action star is fit. However, when the Sherlock Holmes director got wind that the actor was claiming he'd done 1,000 push-ups every day to prepare for his role in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, he was not buying it.E! News' Zuri Hall caught up with the two Brits at the premiere of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword premiere at the TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood.

As with so many other action films, the star of King Arthur had a pretty intense workout regimen to get ready for his role.The Sons of Anarchy star revealed to E! News that on a typical day during shooting, his fitness routine included 1,000 push-ups. We're worn out just thinking about it!"I mean there were some days I didn't hit the goal and I would try to recoup the next day," the actor told Zuri."On the days where I was fighting 14-hours a day, I let myself off and went home, and said 'Okay, let's knock a zero off this equation—100 is good enough for today."

The King Arthur director, however, is calling his bluff."I gotta tell you, 1000 push-ups? Not so much. You'll get 50 out of him at the most! And there's like a half an hour break," Ritchie said of his leading man.But while the Pacific Rim actor may not have undergone quite the transformation he described, David Beckham, who also appears in the film, looks totally unrecognizable, donning fake teeth and scars.The professional soccer player is just one of many stars appearing in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which includes Eric Bana, Jude Law, and Djimon Hounsou in its all-star cast. The movie follows a young Arthur, unaware of his destiny, and his rise to the throne.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will be out in theaters everywhere Friday, May 12th, 2017.

Gilbert Arenas: I Might Join BIG3 League, 'Hopefully Next Year' /nIce Cube is one step closer to adding  "Agent 0 " to his BIG3 league -- with Gilbert Arenas telling TMZ Sports he's seriously considering joining up. 35-year-old Arenas was promoting his Life Water company at 7 /11 in L.A. this week when he told us he's been in talks with Cube's 3-on-3 league about signing on for next season.  In fact, Arenas says he's hoping the two sides can work out a sponsorship deal where his beverage company can be the official drink of the league.  But even if that doesn't work out, Arenas says he'd still consider lacing up -- most likely because he has friends like Kenyon Martin who are having a blast getting back on the court.  As for Gilbert, he's been staying in basketball shape -- constantly posting workout videos from the gym ... and it's impressive stuff./n

Rolling Stone Retracts Article About Alleged Sexual Assault on University of Virginia Campus Rolling Stone has officially retracted its story about an alleged sexual assault on the University of Virginia campus and issued an apology for its .../n
Rolling Stone has officially retracted its story about an alleged sexual assault on the University of Virginia campus and issued an apology for its journalism "failure."A report by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism commissioned by Rolling Stone, released Sunday night, revealed "A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and Struggle for Justice at UVA" was full of errors that were "avoidable". Rolling Stone published the report in full.The published story, which was written by reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely, "glossed over the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from," according to the report. It detailed an alleged brutal gang rape of a student, "Jackie", at one of the school's fraternities. The article immediately made waves and caused the school's president to suspend all fraternities for the rest of the semester.

Erdely apologized to readers, colleagues and "any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a result of my article" via a statement in the New York Times."I did not go far enough to verify her story," Erdely said in her statement. "I allowed my concern for Jackie's well-being, my fear of re-traumatizing her, and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts. These are mistakes I will not make again."Jann Wenner, the magazine's publisher, also told the New York Times that Erdely would keep her job as well as managing editor Will Dana and article editor Sean Woods. Wenner described the story's source as a "really expert fabulist storyteller" who "managed to manipulate" the magazine's process.

Columbia's report detailed three main errors in the story's efforts, which are the magazine's failure to identify the alleged attackers, the failure of Erdely to contact Jackie's three friends and the failure to give the school's fraternity a chance to respond."The reporter did not make an effort, an independent effort, to identify those three people," Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia journalism school, said in an interview accompanying the report. "And yet, by her first draft, we see that she always intended to write in a derogatory way about them.Palma Pustilnik, a lawyer who has spoken for Jackie, told NBC News on Sunday that she and her client had no comment on the Columbia report.

2011 proved to be a British invasion of sorts as Kate and Pippa Middleton both secured numerous front covers on the weeklies, Daphne Guinness moved from the fashion mags to the gossip rags, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley made her big screen debut and the Ecclestone sisters, Petra and Tamara hit U.S. soil.
Kate Middleton was obviously front and center as the blushing bride of Prince William at the royal wedding of the year back in April, but her little sister Pippa almost managed to steal the limelight.

British socialite Petra Ecclestone nearly managed to outdo the royals with her own, opulent, $18 million wedding to James Stunt. The daughter of Formula One head honcho, Bernie Ecclestone, became a media darling with the news that she had purchased Candy Spelling’s Holmby Hills sprawling mansion for a cool $85 million.
Petra’s big sister, Tamara also appeared on our radar with news that U.S. network executives are eager to sign-up the 27-year-old for an American based reality show.
Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has long been a stalwart on the modeling scene as a Victoria’s Secret favorite. But Jason Statham’s main squeeze really upped the ante in the fame stakes when she landed a role in Transformers 2, taking over from Megan Fox as the leading lady.

She may not be British, but she is European, royal, and as eccentric as they get! Spain’s 85-year-old Duchess of Alba hit the headlines following her marriage to her 61-year-old boy toy civil servant Alfonso Díez.

Farrah Abraham Shows Off Belly In Barely-There Bikini Amid Pregnancy Rumors/n
Farrah Abraham may be keeping her possible pregnancy under wraps – but she’s putting her bump on full display! The Teen Mom OG star showed off her burgeoning belly in a barely there bikini.
Abraham showed off her stomach in a revealing green and gold bathing suit over Instagram.



#ad Ladies, some real talk here – @flattummytea kicks bloating hard. Bloating is sooo uncomfortable, both in how it feels and looks. I don’t use this tea for weight control, it’s not about that, it’s for flushing out toxins and cleansing your tummy. From there it completely gets rid of bloating, and gives you a flat tummy. It’s a staple for me, I literally take it everywhere, especially when I’m away from home when I know I can’t always eat super healthy. Anyway, would love to see and know if any of you have a similar issue and or experience, and make sure you go check them out at flattummytea.com – Let me know girls!

As Radar readers know, Abraham sparked pregnancy rumors when she was spotted with a bump while on vacation with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Simon Saran.

“She’s not pregnant,” he told Radar at the time. “I believe she had too much Dr. Pepper to drink for breakfast that left her looking bloated.”
But when her bump was spotted again in a sports bra, Saran changed his tune!
“Yes, she’s 26 and pregnant,” he told Radar, perhaps jokingly.

Abraham has yet to confirm the rumors.
This would be the MTV star’s second child, as she’s mother to daughter Sophia, 8, with ex-boyfriend Derek Underwood. Underwood tragically died in a car accident when Abraham was pregnant.
Abraham wouldn’t be the only pregnant Teen Mom star, as Teen Mom 2’s Kailyn Lowry is expecting her third child in only a few weeks with ex-boyfriend Chris Lopez. She is also mother to Isaac with ex-boyfriend Jo Rivera, and Lincoln with ex-husband Javi Marroquin.

Here's What Finally Caused Donald Trump to Block Chrissy Teigen on Twitter/n
President Donald Trump has put his foot down regarding Chrissy Teigen.The 45th President of the United States decided to block the 31-year-old model on Twitter today after she tweeted that no one likes him.Teigen has been very open on the social media platform when it comes to her view about the president, and it appears he is no longer willing to hear about it. However, she's already proven that it won't stop her from voicing her opinions.In fact, Teigen took to Twitter to inform her followers that Trump blocked her.

"After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him 'lol no one likes you' was the straw," she wrote alongside a screengrab of his blocked Twitter profile.The comment came after Trump tweeted Sunday, "It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President."

Teigen's husband John Legend hasn't publicly responded about the blocking situation, but he's also been very vocal about his feelings regarding the president.This morning, he reposted Mark Salter's tweet about Trump's appearance at the National Boy Scouts Jamboree, which read: "I was a Boy Scout for five or six years. The whole point of the experience was to teach kids not to grow up to be like Donald Trump."

Legend added to the tweet, "Trump is our national embarrassment. The opposite of a role model for our young men. His speech today was sad."Trump has not responded to either Teigen or Legend. Today his focus is on the future of healthcare and voting down Obamacare.

Whomever Angelina Jolie married in 2014 was the same man she fell in love with in 2004.But not long after she and Brad Pitt tied the knot, three years ago today, certain cracks started to appear in the strong front they had presented to the world for all those years of togetherness. And their marriage didn't just end last year, barely two years after becoming husband and wife. It ended with animosity.When Brad and Angie quietly wed at their chateau in France, it felt the most natural of next steps for the wildly famous yet still somewhat enigmatic couple. They had been together for almost a decade and engaged for two years already. Plus, when the kids want something...well, they obviously have the majority vote.

"It does feel different," Jolie told Vanity Fair for its December 2014 issue, one-upping those who flippantly say being married as opposed to just living together doesn't feel different. "It's nice being husband and wife."So if it did feel like a new chapter in life, as opposed to just an extension of what already was, it was a little strange that they spent what should have been their honeymoon period making a movie about a couple whose marriage of 14 years is on the rocks. In By the Sea, which they at least shot amid idyllic surroundings in Malta, the newlyweds play a couple who've grown apart and become infatuated with the amorous couple staying in the next room at a seaside hotel. Meanwhile, the husband is drinking too much and the wife attempts to seduce the young husband next door."A few friends asked if we were crazy," Jolie laughed. "A married couple going through some difficulties...and I'm directing him."She later told London's Telegraph in November 2015, on the eve of the film's release, "If we had married and were just starting a relationship it would have been a disaster, but because we have been together so long we wanted to see how far we could push our relationship and our love and see if we can work together under very intense circumstances and with very complex issues and see if it would make us better."

By the Sea was Jolie and Pitt's first film together since Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the 2005 action thriller in which they play married assassins tasked with killing each other. Despite multiple protestations on their part in light of the fact that Pitt was still supposedly happily married to Jennifer Aniston at the time, Jolie confirmed down the road that they fell in love while shooting the film in 2004. Pitt and Aniston separated in January 2005 and by July of that year Pitt was already painting a picture of domesticity with Jolie in a W photo shoot and accompanying his co-star to Ethiopia when she adopted her second child, Zahara. (Pitt adopted Zahara and her brother Maddox the following year.)Jolie admitted that it was an intense experience due to all the depressing emotions that needed summoning to the surface.

"I'd be directing myself and him in a scene where we're having a fight, and I'd be pulling out the parts [of Brad] that have an aggression toward me or when you're frustrated with each other—it was very heavy," Jolie said in an interview with the Directors Guild of America, before the film came out. "We kept joking that all of the crew felt like they were living in a house where the parents were fighting and you don't know where to stand or where to look."At the same time, they were, at the end of the day, acting and she said the experience actually strengthened their bond. "We may have been having big fights on the set during the day, but at night we were tag-teaming on the bedtime story," Jolie told People in 2015. "As much as we can argue and fight— and we all have our challenges—at the end I say, 'My job is to love him.'" "Brad and I have our issues, but if the characters were even remotely close to our problems we couldn't have made the film."

But while Mr. and Mrs. Smith was a blockbuster, By the Sea—while a much smaller, independent film—came and went in November 2015 and wasn't reviewed particularly positively in the meantime, nor did it come close to recouping its reported $10 million budget. That had to have been a bit of a disappointment for Jolie, who in addition to co-starring and directing, also wrote the screenplay. Her Jolie Pas and Pitt's Plan B Entertainment had also joined forces to produce, making it a true Jolie-Pitt production."We're proud of ourselves for being brave enough to try it," also told the DGA. "I think By the Sea was the hardest film for me because it wasn't [issue-driven, like her feature debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey]. It's something I probably won't do very much of."On multiple levels.As 2015 came to a close and Jolie got working on her next film, in hindsight the bloom may have been off the rose. When interviews veered into personal territory after that, Jolie mainly talked about her children and all of the ways they were broadening their horizons.Not that Jolie and Pitt put on any airs about life being perfect 24/7 before they were officially Mr. and Mrs. Jolie-Pitt, nor did the duo not face their share of personal challenges (Jolie underwent a preventative double mastectomy in 2013, followed by the removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes in 2015); but at the same time, their relationship looked awfully rosy until, as Jolie put it recently, life together became unsustainable.

"I'm fortunate. I think some women have a different experience depending on their partner," Jolie, pregnant at the time with twins, told Vanity Fair in 2008. "I think that affects it. I happen to be with somebody who finds pregnancy very sexy. So that makes me feel very sexy."Three years in she was also still incredibly starry-eyed when it came to Pitt, telling the magazine, "After my last divorce, I said I was absolutely going to marry somebody in another field, an aid worker or something. Then I met Brad, everything I wasn't looking for, but the best man, the best father I could possibly wish for, you know? I don't see him as an actor. I see him very much as a dad, as somebody who loves travel and architecture more than being in movies."About the question of whether she and Pitt would ever marry, she said in 2008, "People have made a lot out of it that we're not, but we both have been married before, and it's very easy to get married—but it's not easy to build a family and be parents together. And maybe we've done it backwards, but we certainly feel married."

After the twins were born, bringing the grand total of children to six, Pitt told Parade in 2009, "Having a family is a choice. It's certainly more than the ball-and-chain that country songs sing about. Our family is the base that gives Angie and me the long tether to go out and do all these other things. It's a big step we've taken. We've put down roots together. As Angie and I carve out our time as a couple, we carve out our lives as individuals."Once the children were a little older, however, they were starting to ask questions. "The kids ask about marriage," Pitt told USA Weekend in 2011. "It's meaning more and more to them. So it's something we've got to look at."

Pitt put a fabulous diamond ring that he designed himself on Jolie's finger in 2012, but they still didn't fast-track their I-dos until Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Pax, Knox and Vivienne Jolie-Pitt encouraged them to go for it. (By then, Pitt's repeated claim that they wouldn't get married until it was legal for everyone was no longer a glaring issue: the U.S. Supreme Court deemed the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional in 2013, paving the way for gay couples to wed.) "We're just waiting for it to be the right time with the kids, with work, when it feels right," Jolie coyly told People in May 2014. "We talk about it occasionally, and the kids talk about it with us."First they legally wed in California, and then had a ceremony at their Chateau Miraval estate on Aug. 23, 2014. Jolie's veil was embroidered with the kids' drawings, Pax made a cake and all the kids helped with the vows. Overall, the wedding preparations resembled plans for an impromptu sleepover in the backyard."It's been an amazing year," Jolie told Us Weekly later on. "I married my love. My son [Maddox] became a teenager. And, I got to bring [Unbroken] to the world."

Jolie reiterated to The Australian Women's Weekly in December 2014 that she was "very happy to be married," but that balancing everything their sprawling family had going on was no joke."We work really hard at nurturing our family to make sure that everybody is alright and everyone stays connected," she said. "Maintaining a marriage and raising kids is hard work. You have to really make sure that your work doesn't get in the way. That you don't do something that is going to put too much strain on your family."Was immediately teaming up for By the Sea too much strain? Aside from the unpleasant subject matter that may or may not have hit too close to home, the film flopped and, while Pitt was off shooting the World War II-era thriller Fury, Jolie was excited to get started on her next film.

It was while Jolie was making that movie, First They Killed My Father (the kind of issue-driven project she thrives on), in Maddox's native Cambodia in 2016 that issues that had apparently been simmering beneath the surface for awhile started to boil over."Things got bad" when the film was in post-production, Jolie told Vanity Fair this summer for the magazine's September 2017 issue. "I didn't want to use that word...Things became 'difficult.'"Rejecting rumors that Pitt wanted a more stable, less itinerant existence for the family, Jolie insisted that their lifestyle "was not in any way a negative. That was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children...They're six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I'm very proud of them."

But all that "time carved out as a couple," as Pitt mentioned in 2009, had taken a toll on the individuals.Pitt had stopped smoking weed a long time ago but he still enjoyed drinking, and it wasn't until after Jolie filed for divorce on Sept. 19, 2016, following an altercation between Pitt and Maddox aboard a flight from London to L.A., that he realized it was time to cut himself off."I've got the cleanest urinary tract in all of L.A., I guarantee you!" he joked to GQ Style last spring about all the vodka-cranberries he had been consuming since he quit drinking. "But the terrible thing is I tend to run things into the ground. That's why I've got to make something so calamitous. I've got to run it off a cliff."Asked if he felt that he did that with everything in life, he agreed. "I do it with everything, yeah. I exhaust it, and then I walk away," he said. I've always looked at things in seasons, compartmentalized them, I guess, seasons or semesters or tenures or… Yeah, it's that stupid."

Jolie, making her film and wrangling six kids, couldn't have been further away from the place of extremes where Pitt found himself."It's just been the hardest time, and we're just kind of coming up for air," Jolie told VF. And though the divorce started off messily, with Jolie asking for primary custody of the children and Pitt needing to work his way back into everyone's (including the court's) good graces, they're on the same page about wanting what's best for the kids."We're all just healing from the events that led to the filing..." she trailed off. "[The kids are] not healing from divorce. They're healing from some ...from life, from things in life." Ultimately, she and Pitt "care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal."Once upon a time, it seemed as if they shared all of the same goals—to be good parents, to give their children a worldly existence, to fulfill themselves creatively and to do all of that together. But at this point, one shared goal is going to have to be enough.

Dr. Phil Criticized for ‘Exploiting’ a Mentally Ill Shelley Duvall/n





                    Robin Williams' Widow Explains What Led to Actor's Suicide

Shelley Duvall, the star of The Shining, recorded an interview with Dr. Phil McGraw for his television show in which Duvall discusses her present battle with an unidentified mental illness.

In a clip from the episode of Dr. Phil that describes Duvall as a “recluse” in its introduction, Duvall explains to Dr. Phil that she does not believe that Robin Williams, her former co-star who committed suicide in 2014, is dead. Instead, she says that he is “shape shifting.” Duvall also tells Dr. Phil that she believes she has a disc has been implanted in her leg and that she’s being threatened by “the Sheriff of Nottingham.”

Duvall’s fans spoke out against Dr. Phil in her defense, saying that he is “showboating the visibly ill.” Vivian Kubrick, daughter of The Shining’s director Stanley Kubrick issued her criticism of the show on Twitter.
“Your exploitive use of Shelly Duvall is a form of LURID ENTERTAINMENT and is shameful,” wrote Kubrick. “You are putting Shelly Duvall ‘on show’ while she is suffering from a pitiable state of ill health. Unquestionably, this is purely a form of lurid and exploitive entertainment — it’s appallingly cruel.”

Nike Just Launched the 1X- 3X Workout Collection of Your Dreams
/n
This article originally appeared on InStyle.com
Working out always feels a little better when you’re wearing something you love.  Now, Nike is making sure every woman can rock a cute outfit when she sweats it out, thanks to its new workout line that includes sizes 1X-3X.
The brand, which had previously only gone up to XL, will also include bra sizes up to 38E. Even better, it features a full range of athletic wear, including geometric print tights, strappy training tanks with exposed backs, graphic T-shirts, printed running shorts, and more.
“Nike’s product range will continue to expand to ensure there is a perfect fit for every athlete,” Nike said in a press release.
“Nike recognizes that women are stronger, bolder and more outspoken than ever,” the press release continued. “In today’s world, sport is no longer something that she does, it’s who she is. The days where we have to add ‘female’ before ‘athlete’ are over. She is an athlete, period. And having helped fuel this cultural shift, we celebrate these athletes’ diversity, from ethnicity to body shape.”
To take the campaign to the next level, Nike brought on influencers Danielle Vanier and Grace Victory to star in it, with both ladies announcing the news of the line—and their shoot with the brand—on their Instagram accounts this week.





 Ladies, @nikewomen now have a plus size range! I'm beyond proud to have been chosen to collaborate with such a huge brand.

Congratulations are in order for Heather Morris and her hubby Taylor Hubbell.The Glee star revealed to her friends tonight that she's pregnant with their second child! Showing her tiny baby bump from the side, Morris posed alongside a large blue ruler that says "The Growing Hubbells" and used that as her hashtag.Soon-to-be mommy and onscreen love interest Naya Rivera was quick to respond to the exciting news, tweeting, "SO exciting! Congrats @HeatherMorrisTV #thegrowinghubbells."The couple welcomed their first child, a son named Elijah, in September of 2014.

Then, in May of this year, Morris tied the knot with her longtime beau and high school sweetheart at Old Canyon Ranch in Topanga, Calif. on Saturday in front of a large group of family and friends, including a handful of Morris' co-stars.After her first pregnancy, Morris decided not to return to Glee for its fifth season.

EXCLUSIVE! Has Baby Birdie Changed Nikki Bella's Mind About Having Kids?/n
It's no secret that John Cena doesn't want kids, and Nikki Bella has come to terms with that.But has the birth of Brie Bella's baby daughter Birdie Joe Danielson changed auntie Nikki's mind about starting a family?"It's funny, I would have thought that and I think John was really worried for that but it's probably been the exact opposite," the Total Bellas star tells E! News exclusively. "How much I absolutely love Birdie and have unconditional love, seeing how much my sister has had to not only sacrifice her body but her life and career has really made me be like, ‘You know what? I'm really content being an aunt the rest of my life.'"

Nikki continued, "I used to not understand. You used to see this on Total Divas and Total Bellas, I didn't understand where John was coming from when he would say he wouldn't want to be a father. It wasn't that he didn't like kids…It was just he works a lot and he would want to home for those kids. I feel the same way. I like being spontaneous and I love my career and I like working on a lot of businesses and I couldn't imagine giving all that up to be at home with a child."Meanwhile, Daniel Bryan opened up to E! the other day about how fatherhood has changed him.

"I would read a lot about how to be a dad. I had never changed a diaper before we had Birdie," he revealed. "And one of the things that they talk about is it can be very hard on a marriage, on a couple, when you had a child. Because there's all these needs you have to take care of. But if you know that and you know that going in and, ‘OK, I'm going to put my partner first.' That sort of thing. And it feels like our relationship has become stronger because of it."

‘I Survived!’ Meghan King Edmonds Confirms ‘RHOC’ Return/n
Meghan King Edmonds finally confirmed that she’s returning to season 12 of The Real Housewives of Orange County — but RadarOnline.com first revealed the news back in May!
“I’m back on #RHOC season 12 with two new additions!” the reality star captioned of a photo of her new title shots.
“Welcome Baby Aspen and @therealgirlygirl and of course my boyfriend @jimedmonds15!” she joked. “I am still in shock that I survived season 12 with an infant and a puppy.”
PHOTOS: Desperate For Fame? Meghan King Edmonds & Jim Edmonds’ Lies EXPOSED!
Edmonds, 32, revealed on the season 11 finale that she wanted to move to St. Louis permanently, saying: “If this is the kind of example my child has to look forward to in the O.C., I don’t know if I want to be around for that.”
She quickly moved back to Missouri after wrapping the reunion, and gave birth to Aspen in her hometown.
But, she quickly returned to become a “friend of the Housewives,” a source told Radar.

“Meghan started off as being a friend or a guest on the show for this upcoming season. She was really wanting to focus on her family,” the insider explained. “Producers had already written Meghan and her family out of the show, so she had to really plead and show them she wanted to return badly.”
Ultimately, Bravo changed their mind on her.
“Negotiations fell through with production on with a potential new cast member, so they were able to make room for Meghan,” the insider said. “She was the last person to get an offer to return to the full-time cast.”

“Producers felt that bringing her back full time could be good for her and good for ratings,” the source added.
Gretchen Rossi is also slated to return to RHOC as a “friend” and filmed scenes with returning star Lydia McLaughlin.

UPDATE! Loretta Lynn Admitted to Hospital After Suffering Stroke/n
UPDATE:Loretta Lynn is on the mend. Her team shared a message to Twitter on Monday: "Loretta thanks everyone for their prayers love and support. She has moved to rehabilitation and we're happy to report she is doing great!"—Loretta Lynn was admitted to the hospital Thursday night after suffering from a stroke.A statement on behalf of the 85-year-old country music icon—who just rang in her birthday on April 14—was released on her official Facebook page."American country music legend Loretta Lynn was admitted into a hospital in Nashville last night after she suffered a stroke at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee," the statement read. "She is currently under medical care and is responsive and expected to make a full recovery."However, Lynn's doctors have still advised her to "stay off the road while she is recuperating."

Thus, the singer will have to postpone several of her upcoming shows. She was expected to perform at the Alabama Theater tomorrow night and Penn's Peak next week. Fans are encouraged to visit her website for more information regarding rescheduling.Unfortunately, Lynn has suffered quite a few health problems over the last few years. In 2011, she was hospitalized for what doctors had diagnosed "as the beginning stages of pneumonia."

A couple years later, in 2013, she had to postpone two shows in Iowa while being treated for exhaustion.Our thoughts are with the singer as she recovers.(This story was originally published Friday, May 5 at 4:48 p.m.)

Kylie Jenner doesn’t just share a tattoo with Travis Scott. She has a ring as well.

The couple continue to fuel marriage rumors when they were spotted wearing matching jewelry on their wedding ring finger Wednesday (June 28, 2017). While stepping out after a lunch date at Plancha Tacos in Los Angeles Wednesday, the two — who have been doing since April — were photographed with a silver ring on each of their left hands.
Kylie, 19, was dressed casually in a white crop top and dark jeans, while her 25-year-old boyfriend was coordinating in head-to-toe in black and a slim white shoelace belt.

Earlier this year, the duo got matching butterfly designs inked on their ankles. In June, a tabloid claimed the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star had secretly wed her rapper beau in a secret ceremony held at her private home.
“It wasn’t a big, glamorous affair like other Kardashian weddings, and only a few close friends were invited,” a source told Life & Style. “But Kylie is crazy about Travis.”

Mimi Actually Did It, Says God Guy/nMariah Carey did in fact get married to Nick Cannon, so says a clergyman for something called the National Church of God in the Caribbean – which definitely makes this nuptial seem all the more legit.Bishop Clifford Petty tells People that he presided over the wedding of Mimi and Nick and specified that he didn't give a sermon. Ok, that clears everything up. Meanwhile, it seems that the couple did get a marriage license in the Bahamas, which means, according to a local official,  "It's still a valid marriage even if it's not filed. Anywhere in the world. "Also, Mariah was supposed to be on  "The View " Monday. Guess not: we've confirmed that she's not scheduled to appear. Was That Really Ashley Dupre at Marquee? Everybody in NYC is buzzing that Ashley Dupre stepped out at Marquee the other night for her 23rd birthday party. But our spies tell us that the happy hooker-alike in the crowd there was about as real as Eliot Spitzer's devotion to his wife.We heard just like everyone else that Client 9's favorite girl was at Marquee, but when we checked her out there, it wasn't her. There was also buzz that Colin Farrell was at the same club, but it wasn't Colin – just a guy who looks a lot like him and gets his comp on at clubs as a result. Amy's Bond Number -- No, No, No Slightly less controversial than Mariah Carey's wedding is the notion that Amy Winehouse is going to do the next 007 song.Well, her producer, Mark Ronson, says that it just isn't going to happen. She's given up working on it, and Ronson says that it would take  "some miracle of science " to finish it. The original Britwreck is  "not ready to record any music, " he tells Sky News./n

I want to commend the D.A.'s office and the New York City Police Department for conducting a thorough and very fair investigation into this incident and not allowing this private disagreement between two acquaintances to turn into a criminal charge.

Forensic psychiatrist Paul Whitehead claims he obtained such information from journals of Mitchell’s estranged wife, Wanda Barzee, according to KSL-TV. Whitehead testified that he believes Mitchell suffers from a “major psychotic illness” and a personality disorder.

KSL-TV reports that Whitehead testified: “Mitchell was talking to Miss Smart about having babies to the point that Smart actually picked out a name if that happened.”

That’s the moment when Smart walked out of the courtroom, with her mother Lois in tow, after giving Whitehead a scathing look. Elizabeth’s father Ed had left the courtroom during an earlier point in Whitehead’s testimony.

Glen Campbell’s 10 Best Musical Moments/n

Glen Campbell, who died Tuesday at age 81 after struggling with Alzheimer’s disease for several years, was one of the most enduring country and pop voices of the past 50 years, leaving behind an immense body of work, including over 50 studio albums, dozens of songs that graced the pop charts, and five No. 1 country hits.
Campbell’s body of work — from his debut 1962 traditional roots record Big Bluegrass Special all the way to his final studio LP, 2013’s See You There — is a vast exploration of the many strands of American music, ranging from jazz to folk to country to bluegrass to gospel. Below, EW has chosen 10 of those songs that best exemplify Campbell’s legendary life in music.
“The Universal Soldier,” 1965
Released just as the war in Vietnam was beginning, “Universal Soldier” was Campbell’s first pop hit of any sort, reaching No. 45 on the charts. Campbell’s jangly folk-rock rendition of Buffy Sainte-Marie’s anti-war anthem was an unlikely breakthrough for Campbell, who by the end of 1965 was quoted as saying, “People who should be advocating burning draft cards should be hung.”

“Gentle on My Mind,” 1967
Cambell’s impassioned delivery of John Hartford’s wistful travelogue was the turning point in the singer’s career, breaking him into the mainstream and opening the gates for a string of chart-topping hits that would soon follow. Though the song has been recorded by hundreds of artists, Campbell’s exquisite version of the country standard remains definitive.

“By the Time I Get to Phoenix,” 1967
Campbell’s first of several hits with songwriter Jimmy Webb, “By the Time I Get to Phoenix” earned Campbell multiple Grammys and established the singer as a bonafide hitmaker. Campbell’s rendition of the tune that Frank Sinatra once called “the greatest torch song ever written” was a soulful expression of regret, heartbreak, and guilt.

“Dreams of the Everyday Housewife,” 1968
The lead single off Campbell’s Wichita Lineman album was one of Campbell’s most disturbing portrayals of middle American malaise. Despite its saccharine strings and easy melody, “Everyday Housewife” was a tortured exploration of aging, nostalgia, and gender.
<p.

“Wichita Lineman,” 1968
“Jimmy saw a guy out in the middle of nowhere, working on high line wires, that’s where he got ‘lineman for the county,’” Campbell once recalled of “Wichita Lineman,” the Jimmy Webb classic written specifically for Campbell. The recording, which featured Campbell’s former bandmates in the Wrecking Crew, is considered by many to be the greatest single of Campbell’s 50-plus year career.

“Galveston,” 1969
Campbell’s triumphant rendition of this Jimmy Webb-penned soldier’s lament, released during the height of Vietnam, further reflected the singer’s ambivalence about war. But his vocal, full of equal parts celebration and pain, sold just about everyone on the song, including Little Richard, who once said, “When Glen Campbell says one word ‘Galveston’ — it shakes me up…That’s the whole soul of it right there, when he says that one word.”

“Rhinestone Cowboy,” 1975
“Maybe the best song I’ve ever sung,” Campbell once said of his signature tune, a depiction of a road-hardened journeyman singer proudly carrying on to the next show. The song, which topped the pop and country charts, was a comeback single for Campbell that also became the biggest hit of his career.

“Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L.A.),” 1975
The singer’s follow-up to “Rhinestone Cowboy” was another personal statement from Campbell, an expression of discomfort and dissatisfaction with big-city fame and showbiz success sung by the sharecropper’s son from Arkansas. “Country Boy” was Campbell’s fifth straight number one hit on the Easy Listening chart, but its schmaltzy veneer masks one of Campbell’s deepest declarations of anxious introspection and self-doubt.

“Southern Nights,” 1977
As his last No. 1 on both the country and pop charts, “Southern Nights” gave Campbell one more taste of massive stardom before the singer receded from the pop consciousness in the 80’s. Allen Toussaint, who wrote the song, was delighted by Campbell’s rendition: “I love Glen’s version,” he once said. “I had never thought of it as an uptempo and mainstream song before.”

“I’m Not Gonna Miss You,” 2014
Campbell’s final studio recording is a devastating reflection on mortality composed several years after Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. “I’m still here but yet I’m gone,” sings Campbell, who co-wrote the composition, in the song’s opening line. Campbell’s final single was nominated for an Oscar and won the Grammy for Best Country Song in 2015.

Ellen DeGeneres: ‘Bullying I Endured in Hollywood After I Came Out Made Up for the Lack of It During My Childhood’/n





 
Ellen DeGeneres is celebrating the 15th season of her daytime talk show this year, but the longtime host’s career was nearly sidelined due to bullying.
“The bullying I endured [in Hollywood] after I came out made up for the lack of it during my childhood,” DeGeneres, 59, tells Good Housekeeping in her September cover interview, on newsstands Aug. 15.
“I moved out of L.A., went into a severe depression, started seeing a therapist and had to go on antidepressants for the first time in my life,” the host explains.
Doug Inglish
On April 30, 1997, DeGeneres herself didn’t just publicly come out as gay — her character on the ABC hit sitcom Ellen did too. The episode titled “The Puppy Episode” was taped in front of a live audience. But a year after she came out, Ellen was canceled.
“It was scary and lonely. All I’d known for 30 years was work, and all of a sudden I had nothing,” she shares. “Plus, I was mad. It didn’t feel fair — I was the same person everyone had always known.”
Although DeGeneres endured a season of deep depression, she didn’t allow the bullies to win.
“Eventually I started meditating, working out and writing again, and I slowly started to climb out of it,” she tells the publication. “I can’t believe I came back from that point. I can’t believe where my life is now.”
Doug Inglish
Now, DeGeneres doesn’t pay any attention to the critics and is focusing on being the best version of herself.
“I don’t know what people are saying about me, and I don’t want to know, because I don’t care,” says DeGeneres. “My motto is, ‘I do my best. You can be with me or not.’ ”

In April, DeGeneres celebrated the 20th anniversary of her sitcom’s iconic coming-out episode on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
“You are here on a very special day. Today we’re celebrating the 20th anniversary of the coming-out episode of my sitcom,” she said.

Fighting back tears, she continued, “It was the hardest thing that I ever had to do in my life and I would not change one moment of it because it led me to be exactly where I am today standing in front of all of you.”

TV Producer Lenora Claire Speaks Out Against Stalking on '48 Hours'/n
WATCH VIDEO HERE
While many Hollywood celebrities become victims of scary stalkers, every day people can become targets as well.
TV producer, art curator and victims’ rights activist Lenora Claire is speaking out about her terrifying experience on Saturday’s episode of CBS hit 48 Hours.
“I’ve had a relentless stalker who has been completely obsessed with terrorizing me every day of my life,” she says in a preview clip for the show, which airs on February 25 at 9 pm et.
Claire’s stalker, Justin Massler, first spotted her in LA Weekly, and began threatening to rape and kill her in 2011. He has never stopped the relentless harassment.
The stunning redhead has a restraining order against Massler, who served jail time for stalking First Daughter Ivanka Trump.
Still, she doesn’t feel safe.

“I can only describe being stalked as feeling like you are being held under water because you can scream and nobody hears you,” she told Radar exclusively.
Now, Claire is dedicated to changing stalking laws to protect other victims.
On the news show, she’ll discuss her nightmare — and most importantly, her ceaseless efforts to change laws for other stalking victims.
“You will see the frustration of victims from navigating everything from the cops to the courts and my proposals for legislation and improvements,” she revealed.

Claire is proposing the creation of a national stalking registry, along with electronic processing for restraining orders. (Many stalkers do not have fixed addresses and cannot be served, meaning the order never goes into effect.)
What’s next up for the activist? Claire said she has a deal for her own TV show.
“The concept for my show would be to help [stalking] victims in every episode, and really explore these crimes and ideally act as an advertisement for why we need these laws,” she explained. “Non-celebrities rarely go public when they are being stalked for fear of the repercussions, which is why there is little understanding of the nature of these crimes. I want to change that.”

Several of Ellis’ costars, including his  True Blood castmates, attended his funeral, according to E! News.
Stars from True Blood included Anna Paquin, who played Sookie; Carrie Preston, who played Arlene, and Rutina Wesley, who played Tara, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Wesley was a longtime friend of Ellis and penned an emotional tribute to him which she shared last week.

Ellis, who had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse for years, died from heart complications on July 8 after he reportedly attempted to withdraw from alcohol on his own.
In a statement released on July 10 by Ellis’ manager Emily Gerson Saines to The Hollywood Reporter, Saines said that Ellis’ father had explained that the actor started going into heart failure after he attempted to withdraw from alcohol. Ellis also had many “stints in rehab” before trying to withdraw without any assistance.
Ellis is survived by his son, Breon, as well as his grandmother, Alex Brown, and his father, Tommie Lee Thompson. He is also survived by his siblings Lakeeia Thomson, Tommie Lee Thompson, Babon Ellis, Maurice Turne, Tianna Thompson, Shaentika Beard and Yvonne Ellis and aunt Tartheaia Thompson.

PDA alert!

Sealed with a kiss! Drake and Jennifer Lopez just confirmed that they are more than friends by locking lips in a series of Instagram videos.

Days after they were photographed cuddling together, the rumored couple attended a prom-themed winter formal party, where they were filmed kissing on the dance floor after being named king and queen of the evening. In several clips that surfaced online, Drake and Lopez couldn’t keep their hands off each other as they traded smooches and danced along to what sounded like their soon-to-be released collaboration.

The duo first sparked romance rumors when Drake was seen attending two of J.Lo’s Las Vegas shows in one week. Days later, the Canadian rapper shut down West Hollywood hotspot Delilah and invited Lopez to an intimate shindig he was throwing for only a handful of friends. The couple were spotted leaving the private party together that night.

The Tiger Woods Interview, Full Transcript/n
Tiger Woods has just answered questions for the first time, since the November 27 car accident.
Here is the full transcript of the five-minute interview, with ESPN’s Tom Rinaldi, as it aired on ESPN, here on RadarOnline.com.
Rinaldi: What’s the difference between the man who left Augusta national a year ago and the one who is about to return?
Woods: A lot has transpired in my life. A lot of ugly things have happened. Things that…..I’ve done some pretty bad things in my life. And uh, all came to a head. But now, after treatment, going for inpatient treatment for 45 days and more outpatient treatment, I’m getting back to my old roots.
Rinaldi: For a lot of people, the spark of those bad things is Nov. 27. Early that day, what happened?
Woods: Well, it’s all in the police report. Beyond that, everything’s between Elin and myself and that’s private.
Rinaldi: Why did you lose control of the car?
Woods: As I said … that’s between Elin and myself.
Rinaldi: If it’s a private matter, why issue a public apology?
Woods: Well, I owe a lot of people an apology. I hurt a lot of people. Not just my wife. My friends, my colleagues, the public, kids who looked up to me. There were a lot of people that thought I was a different person and my actions were not according to that. That’s why I had to apologize. I was so sorry for what I had done.
Rinaldi: You’ve said you’ve made transgressions. How would you, in your own words, describe the depth of your infidelity?
Woods: Well, just one is, is enough. And obviously that wasn’t the case, and I’ve made my mistakes. And as I’ve said, I’ve hurt so many people, and so many people I have to make an amends to, and that’s living a life of amends.
Rinaldi: You said you were in treatment. The simple question is, for what?
Woods: That’s a private matter as well. But I can tell you what, it was tough, it was really tough to look at yourself in a light that you never want to look at yourself, that’s pretty brutal.
Rinaldi: What’d you see?
Woods: I saw a person that I never thought I would ever become.
Rinaldi: Who was that?
Woods: Well, I had gotten away from my core values as I said earlier. I’d gotten away from my Buddhism. And I quit meditating. I quit doing all the things that my mom and dad had taught me. And as I said earlier in my statement, I felt entitled, and that is not how I was raised.
Rinaldi: Why not seek treatment before all of this came out?
Woods: Well, I didn’t know I was that bad. I didn’t know that I was that bad.
Rinaldi: How did you learn that? How did you learn it?
Woods: Stripping away denial, rationalization. You strip all that away and you find the truth.
Rinaldi: How do you reconcile your behavior with your view of marriage?
Woods: That’s living a life of amends and that’s just working at it each and every day.
Rinaldi: Given all that’s happened, what’s your measure of success at Augusta?
Woods: Well, playing is one thing. I’m excited to get back and play. I’m excited to get to see the guys again. I really miss a lot of my friends out there. I miss competing. But still, I still have a lot more treatment to do, and just because I’m playing, doesn’t mean I’m gonna stop going to treatment.
Rinaldi: What reception are you expecting from fans?
Woods: I don’t know. I don’t know. I’m a little nervous about that to be honest with you.
Rinaldi: How much do you care?
Woods: It would be nice to hear a couple claps here and there. But also hope they clap for birdies, too.
Rinaldi: Eleven months ago, here at Isleworth, I asked you, ‘How well does the world know you?’ What’s your answer to that now?
Woods: A lot better now. I was living a life of a lie. I really was. And I was doing a lot of things, like I said, that hurt a lot of people. And stripping away denial and rationalization you start coming to the truth of who you really are and that can be very ugly. But then again, when you face it and you start conquering it and you start living up to it. The strength that I feel now, I’ve never felt that type of strength.
Rinaldi: In the last four months, Tiger, what’s been the low point?
Woods: I’ve had a lot of low points. Just when I didn’t think it could get any lower, it got lower.
Rinaldi: An example?
Woods: When I was in treatment, out of treatment, before I went in, there were so many different low points. People I had to talk and face like my wife, like my mom.
Rinaldi: What was that moment like, either one?
Woods: They both have been brutal. They’ve both been very tough. Because I hurt them the most. Those are the two people in my life who I’m closest to and to say the things that I’ve done, truthfully to them, is … honestly … was … very painful.
Rinaldi: What was your wife’s reaction when you sat down and had that first conversation?
Woods: She was hurt, she was hurt. Very hurt. Shocked. Angry. And, you know, she had every right to be and I’m as disappointed as everyone else in my own behavior because I can’t believe I actually did that to the people I loved.
Rinaldi: I ask this question respectfully, but of course at a distance from your family life. When you look at it now, why did you get married?
Woods: Why? Because I loved her. I loved Elin with everything I have. And that’s something that makes me feel even worse, that I did this to someone I loved that much.
Rinaldi: How do you reconcile what you’ve done with that love?
Woods: We work at it. /n
'Fractured' Family? Charlie Reveals Challenges Of Life With Denise & Brooke/n
For a while, Charlie Sheen was best known for his bevy of “goddesses.” But it’s his ongoing relationships other women that truly have defined his life: He has one daughter, Cassandra, 28, from former high school girlfriend Paula Profitt, two daughters — Sam, 11, and Lola, 10 — with Denise Richards, and twin boys Bob and Max, 6, with socialite and TV personality Brooke Mueller. As his unconventional family guides him through the most challenging time of his life, Sheen spoke to RADAR about what it’s really like with Richards and Mueller behind the scenes.
DYLAN HOWARD: How did your ex-wives react to the health crisis? First of all, Denise Richards.
CS: She was immediately supportive. There was no judgment there. There was no fear about anything. She’s a tough lady; she’s dealt with her mom’s cancer and her mom’s death. Denise wanted nothing but the best for me, there was nothing, again, nothing but support.
DH: Brooke Mueller?
CS: Same with Brooke. She was sad for me but then realized that I’m a pretty tough customer and she knew I would handle it and do whatever I had to.

DH: What is your relationship like with your two ex-wives?
CS: With Denise, it’s good most of the time. It’s fractured at times — like any divorced couple’s relationship would be. But in times of good or bad, we still focus on the children and their needs. We try to park our differences and move forward.
DH: You’ve had a roller-coaster marriage to Brooke. What’s it like today?
CS: It’s good today. She doesn’t let it get boring, I’ll tell you that.
DH: What do you mean by that?
CS: I don’t mean anything by that. Brooke is a character and she’s a great mom and, again, we’re trying to do what’s right for the kids.

DH: What about your relationship status at the moment? Are you in a romantic relationship?
CS: It’s not romantic but it’s definitely a relationship that I’m in!
DH: Committed?
CS: Yes, you wanna know with who? Myself! How about that?
DH: I guess you never talk back to yourself.
CS: We have some of the best conversations in the world!
DH: There’s nothing like spending time with the person you love the most!
CS: I wouldn’t say I love myself the most, but there’s no interest in being in a relationship right now. There’s no real time to pursue a relationship. /n
 Khloe Kardashian’s Hair Loss Caused By Stressful Divorce From Lamar Odom, Experts Say.../n
Khloe Kardashian’s stressful divorce from her husband of four years, Lamar Odom, is taking a toll on the reality star’s health.
After stepping out with a large bald patch on her head, fans began wondering if her thinning tresses were the result of long-term distress and anxiety — and experts exclusively tell RadarOnline.com, the answer is YES!
“A major stress, such as divorce, can lead to a type of hair shedding called Telogen Effluvium, or stress shedding,” cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Doris Day tells Radar.
“This is a diffuse hair shedding that typically occurs about three months after the stress occurs, due to the nature of hair growth cycles,” she notes, confirming that Khloe’s marriage woes have been weighing on her for a long time.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star has lost large clumps of hair, which can also be a sign of an autoimmune condition called alopecia areata, reveals Debra Jaliman, MD, author of the new book Skin Rules: Trade Secrets From A Top Dermatologist.
“Stress can cause hair loss, and with this condition, the hair follicles are attacked by the body,” Jaliman says.
Thankfully, the hair loss can be reversed.
“It can be treated by injections of cortisone into the hair follicle. I also recommend using Rogaine for men once a day. Biotin can also be used. 2.5 mg a day…  [And] hair can be seen to grow back in 1 to 3 months,” Jaliman adds.

Neither doctor has personally treated Khloe.
As Radar previously reported, the couple’s four-year marriage, once documented on the E! reality show Khloe & Lamar, deteriorated in the face of numerous scandals the past few months, with a microscope focused toward Odom’s alleged indiscretions and infidelities.
This summer, multiple women stepped forward claiming they’d had extramarital affairs with Khloe’s husband, including Polina Polonsky, a criminal defense attorney; Jennifer Richardson, who said she and the basketball player would spend time together on extended trips; and Sandy Schultz, a graduate student who said her on-and-off affair with Odom leaked into the time he’d been married to the reality star.
Odom’s alleged struggle with prescription drug abuse — namely the powerful opiate Oxycontin — and illicit drugs like cocaine and crack, also played a large role in their crumbling marriage. /n
Mariachi Superstar Pepe Aguilar's Son Cops Plea Deal in Human Smuggling Case/nMariachi superstar Pepe Aguilar's son hopes to avoid serious prison time after striking a plea deal for smuggling a Chinese national in the trunk of his car. Jose Emiliano Aguilar pled guilty to 1 count of failing to present an undocumented alien at the border crossing ... according to docs obtained by TMZ. We broke the story, Emiliano was caught at the border Tijuana border crossing with 4 people in the trunk. Emiliano potentially could have been hit with 4 counts -- one for each person -- but the plea deal knocks that down to just one. Customs and Border Control had released the photo of his human cargo. His powerhouse attorney, Jeremy Warren, tells us Emiliano made a huge mistake, takes responsibility and looks forward to being a productive member of society. His father, Pepe ... is a Grammy-winning singer with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Emiliano's hoping for way less than the 10-year max he could get when he's sentenced in August./n
Miley Cyrus Won't Do a Hannah Montana Reboot Because She's Sick of Her Dad
/n
Reboots of classic TV shows are all the rage. Full House has done it. So has Gilmore Girls and Arrested Development. Twin Peaks is on the way. And just this week, NBC and ABC confirmed Will & Grace and Roseanne would be back too.
But could a reboot of Hannah Montana be in the future?
Not if Miley Cyrus has anything to do with it.
The 24-year-old singer, who starred as a normal girl by day and famous singer by night on the hit Disney Channel show from 2006 to 2011, told The Zach Sang Show on Tuesday that she has no plans to step back into Montana’s shoes — mainly because the series would likely involved her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus.
DISNEY CHANNEL/BYRON COHEN
“[I] probably [wouldn’t do a Hannah Montana reboot],” she said when asked if she would revive the show. “It’s a lot of time to be spent with my dad. You know, my dad was my dad on the show. I have enough dad time.”
According to Miley, not having an escape from her family was stifling. “That was really hard every day from, like, [ages] 11 to 18,” she said. “I didn’t get a school escape like most people. I went to work with my dad. And then I started driving my dad toward the end, when I could start driving. And then my grandma went with me every day. It was a lot of time with dad and grandma.”

It also fueled her wild image over the past few years. “That’s why, as soon as I turned 18, you guys wonder why I was twerking at Juicy J shows,” she joked. “I had just spent 10 years every day with my dad and grandma! I had to break free.”

Miley has left much of that behind now — with a hot new single, a stripped-down mellow sound, and a softer image. And though she’s not looking forward to working with her dad every day, Billy Ray is joining her on season 13 of The Voice as a guest mentor.
“I asked my dad to be my mentor because I’ve loved him being my mega-mentor, so I want him to be [that] for the other kids as well,” Miley said. “And I’m coming for Blake [Shelton], so that’s why! I’m bringing in Dad.”
And just because she’s not interested in going back to her Disney Channel days doesn’t mean Miley won’t be watching — especially Raven-Symoné’s upcoming That’s So Raven reboot.
“I’m really excited for that,” Cyrus said. “That’s going to be my binge watch of the year, for sure.”

Despite backlash, plenty of viewers tuned in for Lifetime's Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B TV movie.

EW reports the movie is Lifetime's No. 2 movie of the year in the 18-49 demographic after Flowers in the Attic. The movie also featured Elise Neal as Gladys Knight, Clé Bennett as R. Kelly and Chattrisse Dolabaille as Missy Elliott.

Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B hailed from executive producer Wendy Williams and was ripe with controversy. First star Zendaya dropped out of the movie after her casting was announced, with sources citing production concerns after the movie was not able to secure the rights to the star's songs.The movie received a bevy of backlash when it actually aired, with viewers citing the relationship portrayed between R. Kelly and Aaliyah as problematic and the portrayal of other key figures. Timbaland took to social media to address the movie. "Hope yall not watching this!!!!!!!!" he said, and added, "People! Thanks for the comments tonight on that bulls--t Aliyah movie! They have felt Timbo's wrath tonight, baby!"

Producer Williams seemed pleased with the movie and perceived it a success. "I see my Aaliyah movie broke the Internet this weekend! Errbody got an opinion," she said on her daytime talk show. "Well, I must tell you, whether you loved or hate, you watched. It was the second-highest rated movie on all of cable this year so far."This is just the latest Lifetime movie about Hollywood figures to ruffle feathers. This year the network aired a Saved by the Bell movie and one about the late Brittany Murphy.

Barron Trump Is D.C. Bound As He'll Be Attending A Private Episcopal School In Maryland This Fall/n

Barron Trump is heading to D.C.
On Monday, it was announced by Melania Trump that her 11-year-old will be switching schools as they're relocating to the White House after this school year. About damn time.
Related: Trump Is 'Frustrated And Angry At Everyone'
According to FLOTUS, the youngest Trump child will be attending a private Episcopal school in Maryland, named St. Andrew's this fall. And Andy Cohen better look into casting a Real housewife with a younger kiddo at the St. Andrew's Episcopal School as it's located in Potomac, Maryland. We mean, it'll be such a missed opportunity if the reality TV guru doesn't lock in a housewife who has a kid that goes to school with Barron.
It's said Mrs. Trump selected St. Andrew's as her son's next school as it's known for having a diverse community and is committed to academic excellence.
And the Trumps will be shelling out quite a bit for their son to attend the private institution as tuition ranges from $23,000 for pre-K to $40,000+ for grades nine through 12. But hey, it's not like Donnie can't afford it!

Joseph Gordon-Levitt knows how to visit a college!Despite a few inches of snow, the actor made his way to Harvard's campus Friday evening where he receiving Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 50th Man of the Year award.Before taking home his special prize, Joseph went through plenty of obstacles in front of a packed house. According to the Harvard Gazette, the actor was roasted by two college students before being put through a fiery obstacle course to receive the highly coveted Pudding Pot.Whether milking a cow, performing a sexy dance for a Russian porn star (played by a college senior) or reprising his role as Robin from The Dark Night Rises, Joseph didn't hesitate to participate in all challenges.

In fact, he even impersonated his close friend and co-star Seth Rogen when he stripped down to his Calvin Klein underwear and mismatched socks."I spent the last two days here," Joseph told the audience who couldn't stop chanting "Robin! Robin!" "There's a thoughtfulness, optimism, passion, worldliness, sense of humor that leaves me feeling optimistic about people younger than I am. You guys are really doing great."Neil Patrick Harris, Chris Pratt and Robert De Niro have also received the special title in recent years.

 In fact, Scandal star Kerry Washington was honored with the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year Woman of the Year award just last week.Once Joseph bids farewell to Harvard, the actor will star in a brand-new musical comedy with Channing Tatum. While the plot remains top-secret, we can tell you the gentlemen will act as two pilots who embark on a "misadventure.""[Joseph] and I have been friends since I got to town 13 years ago, and we're going to eventually land on something together, because we've talked about it too long for it not to happen," Channing told Vulture in late January. "He's one of the most creative people I know, and I don't think there's anybody besides him I would think about doing it with."

Karma? Ann Curry Not Surprised By Brian Williams Backlash — Why He Lost Her Trust/n
Former TODAY show co-anchor Ann Curry knows a little bit about being dragged through the mud at NBC. But RadarOnline.com has learned she isn’t exactly offering former friend Brian Williams support during his own time of scandal. Insiders tell Radar she’s “not surprised” at the current backlash, because of a secret slight that torpedoed their once-strong relationship.
Curry and NBC Nightly News anchor Williams used to have a “very close professional working relationship, and when she got infamously booted from TODAY, Brian was one of her biggest champions,” an insider explained.
As such, when Williams needed time off over a holiday weekend in early 2013, “It was Brian that suggested Ann fill in for him,” said the source, “and she did.”

But it didn’t go as smoothly as expected.
“Brian was stunned when viewers tuned out and the ratings reflected that,” the source said. “The ratings took a huge nose dive and Brian never forgot it. He had trusted Ann, and he felt she had let him down.”
“Their relationship never recovered after that,” said the source, and now, “Ann isn’t surprised that Brian doesn’t have a lot of his colleagues’ support after what went down with them. Ann is just happy to be away from all of that drama.”

With Williams’ future as anchor of NBC Nightly News now uncertain, Curry still has no regrets about leaving.
“Brian’s job as anchor has always been Ann’s dream job because it doesn’t require the fluff of the morning shows,” the source revealed. “But Ann knows even if she had stayed at NBC, there was no way she would have ever been named anchor. She might have been able to get a bit more money as part of her exit deal, but Ann has no regrets about leaving.”
The 58-year-old Curry recently came to an agreement with the network to end her $12 million annual contact after her on-camera appearances had dramatically dwindled in recent months, with her last coming on Dec. 1.

NBC said that the veteran journalist would occasionally appear on platforms “seeded” by the production company Curry was starting.
NBCUniversal News Group chairman Pat Fili-Krushel said, “We’re proud to support Ann in her new venture, and we look forward to more of her exceptional storytelling. She is committed to uncovering critical issues, humanizing them, and ultimately helping viewers understand and connect.”
Williams is under investigation by NBC after admitting that he made “a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago” in describing an event from the Iraq war.

“I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by (enemy) fire,” he admitted. “Instead, I was in the following aircraft.”
Williams then said it was a “bungled attempt by me to thank one special veteran and by extension our brave military men and women, veterans everywhere.”
He subsequently announced he would take a leave of absence from the show while NBC investigates. Lester Holt is filling in. /n

Summer Shadow: Cle de Peau's Amazonite/n
Though best known for their ridiculously amazing concealer, Cle de Peau has an extensive makeup line, which we have recently become obsessed with! While many makeup products can dry out your skin, every eye shadow, mascara and lipstick we have sampled from the collection has left our skin feeling smooth and refreshed.
Cle de Peau’s Must-Have Concealer
One of our favorite new products, is their Satin Eye Color ($45).  Available in every shade under the sun, from Obsidian, a smoky black, to pink opal, a peachy pink, the luxuriously smooth shadow manages to stay on our lids all day, without ending up under our eyes.  We also love the sleek, navy blue compact the shadow comes in, which contains a mini mirror and brush.

We got our Superman, and now we have our Lois Lane.Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures announced today that Amy Adams has been cast as Lois Lane, the reporter who steals the heart of Clark Kent in the Zack Snyder reboot of the Superman movie...

Snyder says in a statement: "Second only to Superman himself, the question of who will play Lois Lane is arguably what fans have been most curious about. So we are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful."Adams will play opposite Henry Cavill, 27, who was cast as Clark Kent back in January. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane have been cast to play Mr. and Mrs. Kent, the adoptive parents of Superman. Adams, 36, is coming off an Academy Award nomination for her work in The Fighter alongside Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale.In some not-so-super news, Snyder's recent directorial effort, Sucker Punch, came in second this weekend at the box office, grossing only $19 million.

Vampire Diaries: Paul Wesley, Nina Dobrev, More React to the Series Finale
/n
This article originally appeared on EW.com
Spoiler alert: This post contains spoilers from the series finale of The Vampire Diaries. Read at your own risk!
After eight seasons of love triangles, brother bonding, decade dances, and immortal foes, The Vampire Diaries ended with Stefan Salvatore saving the day. But this time, saving the day cost him his life.
In the show’s series finale, Stefan sacrificed himself in order to kill Katherine Pierce and destroy hell. In doing so, he was able to find peace, and by hour’s end, a human Damon and a human Elena would join him in that peace, with both of them reuniting with their families — Elena hugging her parents on her front porch and Damon getting one last brother hug at the Salvatore mansion.
As for everyone else: We left Matt contemplating a run for mayor, Bonnie on her way to travel the world, and Caroline and Ric opening a school for their daughters and other “gifted” children like them. (Yes, Klaus Mikaelson was a major donor.)
RELATED: The 20 Best Episodes of The Vampire Diaries
So while fans figure out their feelings on the finale, EW talked to the cast about their reaction when they first read the show’s farewell:
Candice King (Caroline Forbes): As a viewer of television and a lover of series finales, from just a fan perspective, I think it is incredibly fulfilling and emotional and it leaves doors open but it also brings a lot of closure. I was just excited. I kind of knew some tidbits just from talking with Julie [Plec] before, but I just thought it was a beautiful ending to eight years of twists and turns and characters and love interests and heartbreaks and triangles and ships and death and life and all that’s in between.
Matt Davis (Alaric Saltzman): I got pretty emotional about it. Anytime you have that moment where characters from the past reappear and merge, I always get emotional about that.
Ian Somerhalder (Damon Salvatore): Well, it’s not the ending that Paul and I always thought we would get — just the two bros in some Speedos on the beach drinking some rum. These things are hard to write. You obviously want to pay off an audience for going on a very long journey with you. The writers themselves want to pay off their own artistic integrity. And so it’s invariably difficult to satisfy everyone, and that’s what I find so interesting about the endings of TV shows that people go on and on and on discussing. You’re never going to satisfy an entire populous of people. The interpretation that you leave is what you leave. This is the end of our show.
Zach Roerig (Matt Donovan): I think ending this show was probably the hardest thing Julie’s ever had to do in writing. She and Kevin [Williamson] did a great job. But I just really loved Stefan’s sacrifice — that was a beautiful way to end it. It kind of diffused any of the feelings that were going on from all the things that have happened before, especially with Bonnie. I thought it was really beautifully written.
Paul Wesley (Stefan Salvatore): I didn’t [know ahead of time about death]. I had been telling them that I think Stefan should die. He’s been the Ripper; he was the one who caused his brother to turn into a vampire. All the murders Damon did were all my fault really, if it comes down to the genesis of it. I just felt like he’s been the hero of the story to a degree and it only made sense for him to die at the end. They totally teased me and said that he wouldn’t die, so they really taunted me for a couple months. I read the finale script on an airplane. The first five acts, I was kind of like, “Okay yeah, this is interesting,” but it didn’t really hit me until the sixth act. And then the sixth act I teared up and I never really tear up when it comes to sentimental Vampire Diaries-esque things. I thought how it ended was powerful.
Nina Dobrev (Elena Gilbert/Katherine Pierce): I am satisfied with the way the show ends — the fact that Elena finds peace and becomes human, which is what she always wanted. She gets to be with the man that she loves, which is what she always wanted. She gets to say goodbye to her former love and now best friend. I cried during a lot of moments. I didn’t get the chance to be at the final read-through unfortunately but maybe that’s for the best because I would’ve been a mess. I cried during Stefan and Caroline’s final moments, because it broke my heart. I cried at the end when I read that Elena was writing in the diary again, when Elena basically says the same sentence that I did in the pilot eight years ago.

Khloe Is Destroying My Son Lamar/n
Lamar Odom‘s desperate dad claimed wife Khloe Kardashian has taken over the troubled hoop star’s life by controlling his finances — and keeping him isolated from old friends and even his family!
Lamar, 36, who won two NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers, survived a near-fatal drug overdose last October inside a Nevada brothel.
“(Khloé) is answering his phone and checking his texts, too,” Lamar’s disabled dad, Joe Odom, told The National ENQUIRER.
“I can’t get through to him anymore!”
PHOTOS: Khloe Refusing To Divorce Lamar Over Money & Property
The 62-year-old Vietnam-era vet claimed the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star has taken over Lamar’s finances “even though he’s recovering,” and is terrified that by keeping pals and family from seeing him, Lamar will fall back into destructive drug habits.
“I am praying that doesn’t happen,” said Joe .
Kardashian, 31, took full control of Lamar’s life following his overdose, moving him into the house next door to her so she could keep a closer eye on him.
Joe, a former junkie, has also fallen victim to Kardashian’s control. She booted him and his wife, Cecilia, out of the $4,000-a-month Los Angeles home Lamar had been paying for the past decade.

Joe and Cecilia were forced to move back to Brooklyn, N.Y., where they now live in a cramped apartment and are barely surviving on his meager veteran’s pension.
“Khloe didn’t even have the guts to tell me herself that my rent wasn’t going to be paid anymore,” griped Joe. “We had just days to get out! I should be there for him in L.A., instead of thousands of miles away.”
Joe also claimed Kardashian has created obstacles around Lamar to keep away his closest pals, including former welterweight boxing champ Zab Judah.
“Zab and Lamar were real close,” said Joe. “He was helping him get back into condition and doing positive things. Lamar would have benefited from hearing his voice … holding his hand. But that wasn’t to be.”

Though Joe is desperate to reconnect with Lamar, he’s grateful to be out of the spotlight that everyone in the Kardashian clan craves so desperately.
“All that drama is not for me,” he asserted. /n

Kanye West Responds (Calmly) to Fern Mallis' Diss: ''I Have Encountered Countless Amounts of Bigotry'' Kanye West is responding to Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week creator Fern Mallis' not-so-nice comments about him. .../n
Kanye West is responding to Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week creator Fern Mallis' not-so-nice comments about him.Earlier this week, Mallis was asked what she thought of the rapper turned designer at New York Fashion Week. "I'm kind of over Kanye," the 66-year-old former CFDA executive director bluntly stated. "I mean, I'm not a fan of his music, and the attitude and the agenda is not my style."Now, the 37-year-old Grammy winner and fashion enthusiast is calling out Mallis in a series of surprisingly calm tweets.

"To Fern Mallis: I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult and I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way," Kanye tweeted today. "I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world. I don't call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martins because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design."He continued, "Fame is often looked down upon in the design world, so it's actually been something I had to overcome. All we have are our dreams, and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want, but we won't stop fighting. We want to innovate and we will win someday. If you wanna have a drink with me, book a table at the spotted pig when I'm back in NY."Way to take the high road, Kanye!

Jon Gosselin Is "Relentlessly Fighting for His Kids'' After Multiple Confrontations With Kate Gosselin, Lawyer Says Jon's legal representative could not share details regarding past or future court hearings, citing the &q.../n
Jon Gosselin will do whatever it takes to protect his family. Just yesterday, the reality TV star called authorities to ROG Orthodontics in Wyomissing, Penn. over a "verbal domestic dispute" with ex-wife Kate Gosselin. Wyomissing Police confirmed to E! News that the former couple could not come to an agreement as to which parent one of their 13-year-old daughters would go home with. Ultimately, no arrests were made, officers escorted Kate out of the building and the child left with Jon at her request. Now it appears this incident isn't the first time in recent memory that Jon and Kate have clashed over their sextuplets and twins' custody agreement. His attorney, Kristen Doleva-Lecher, tells E! News that a separate exchange took place on Aug. 15 in a parking lot and as a result, Jon is making an effort to  "do what is right."Doleva-Lecher explains, "The ability to co-parent is desirous in all custody matters, unfortunately in this case, it remains a theory, not a reality."

Jon's legal representative could not share details regarding past or future court hearings, citing the "Gag Order," but did express her client's intentions in fighting Kate on the matter. "However," she says, "it should be known Jon has been aggressively and relentlessly fighting for his kids. Jon is frustrated by recent events but will not be derailed in his efforts to do what is right."Jon and Kate, who starred on multiple TLC series before their 2009 split, share eight children together: 16-year-old twins Cara and Madelyn and 13-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Alexis, Collin, Hannah, Joel and Leah. Over the years, their inability to amicably co-parent has stirred public interest and captivated headlines. In 2015, Jon filed for full custody of their daughter Hannah, because as a source described, "She is unhappy and uncomfortable in the house with Kate Gosselin."

As of June 2016, Jon said their custody agreement allows him to see only four of their children at once, during weekly dinners and overnights every other weekend.A separate insider shares with E! News, "The custody situation has been changing over the past month and it's been very hard on the kids."According to a report from InTouch, which Doleva-Lecher confirmed occurred, police were present for an incident involving Hannah and her parents at a parking lot off a Pennsylvania highway on Aug. 15. Kate allegedly tried to pull the teen out of Jon's vehicle, but Hannah "violently resisted." An ambulance was called and Hannah was reportedly treated at the hospital for an arm injury. When asked about allegations of child abuse, Kate told Good Morning America's Amy Robach last November that although she's been investigated by Child Protective Services, she insists there's no truth to the rumors. "I'm in the public eye. I have been investigated many times," she said. "It's always unfounded, obviously."

E! News has reached out to Kate's representative for comment.

Robert Pattinson Was Nearly Fired From Twilight In hindsight, Pattinson said, shooting the five Twilight films was "an amazing luxury." It was "amazing luck, as well, to just have fallen into it with the group of people I work.../n
Try to imagine Twilight without Robert Pattinson.Playing the vampire Edward Cullen made Pattinson a household name, but as he recalled in an interview with The New York Times over the weekend, he was nearly fired while making the first film, released in 2008. His agents intervened, flying to the Canadian set to calm him down. "I didn't have to kiss anybody's [butt] the entire time," he recalled. "I don't think I did, anyway."(The movie star told Yahoo! Movies in 2012 that he took his method acting to so seriously that he "was fighting with everybody in control all the time...to the point where I almost got fired.")

In hindsight, Pattinson said, shooting the five Twilight films was "an amazing luxury." It was "amazing luck, as well, to just have fallen into it with the group of people I worked with on it." And if he's forever associated with Edward Cullen, so be it. "I think one of the best things, basically, about being a bit of a sellout, is if you've done five movies in a series, you've had to accept some responsibility for playing the same character," Pattison, 31, told the newspaper.The actor is particularly proud of 2012's Cosmopolis, the first movie he made after Twilight ended. "I think it was the first time when I worked on something that was quite complex," Pattinson said. "I especially love the fact that it came out really at the height of my popularity." It was "the big turning point for me," he added. "I just realized that was what I wanted to do."

Pattinson was a fan of director-producer-writer David Cronenberg's style, which was unlike that of anyone else he had ever worked with before. "I think it's so rare for something to break a pattern," he explained. "I feel like almost everything in the world is designed to be predictable."The Good Time actor, whose next projects include High Life and The Souvenir, is at his best when he's operating outside of his comfort zone. Just don't ask him to watch his work, as it makes him very self-conscious. "I've never seen anyone give themselves such a hard time. I'm beating myself up afterward. And I think there's some weird perverted energy that comes out of when people criticize previous work or think you represent this certain thing; it gives you this energy," Pattinson said, joking that he's "almost scared of anyone saying anything I do is good."

Here's to a speedy recovery.Nine days after surviving a fiery, deadly plane crash, former Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker has been released from Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Ga."He was discharged this morning at 10 a.m.," hospital spokeswoman Beth Frits told E! News.The 32-year-old rocker was admitted, along with Adam "DJ AM" Goldstein, following the Sept. 19 takeoff crash of their Learjet, a mishap that left the four others onboard dead.

Barker and Goldstein suffered second- and third-degree burns but are expected to make full, albeit potentially lengthy, recoveries.Goldstein was released from the hospital on Friday and made his way back to Los Angeles via plane. Barker, too, is en route to the West Coast—on a bus—along with his constant companion for the past week, ex-wife Shanna Moakler.Just last week, Barker's friend and fashion partner Jermaine Dupri made the media rounds, estimating the drummer would be in the hospital for two more weeks.Apparently not all good things require a wait.

Lohan's Papa Gets Preachy/nNow that Lindsay Lohan is officially in rehab, as TMZ first reported yesterday, it's her ex-felon dad Michael -- not her normally motormouth mom Dina -- who's making a lot of noise, pleading with Lindsay and trying to build a treatment center for people like Lindz. Michael, who just finished a prison sentence, is teaming up with none other than bible-thumper Stephen Baldwin and a virulently anti-abortion, anti-gay pastor to build a $15 million treatment center in Southampton, NY, reports the New York Post. Papa Lohan himself is reportedly undergoing drug treatment in a West Babylon facility, and is telling Us that his daughter needs to cut certain people out of her life -- like celeb DJ Samantha Ronson and bodyguards -- and let God in. Meanwhile, far from running to the next starlet's side, one of Lohan's Hollywood pals, Brittny Gastineau, tells BestWeekEver.tv,  "I think she should do whatever is going to make her happy ... not the people around her, like managers and lawyers. " And her parents?  Jordin's Voice Not So God-Blessed?  "American Idol " winner Jordin Sparks told the world over and over again just how great a gift from God her voice was and that she'd never had vocal training -- but it might not be so heaven-sent after all. Her vocal coach, Melissa Black, tells Star magazine (via MSNBC) that she tutored Sparks a few years back when Jordin was 14, and that she had weekly sessions. Black doesn't pooh-pooh Jordin's talent --  "I knew she wouldn't take long to perfect her craft because she was so good " -- but says she was  "hurt for a week " when Jordin said she hadn't had any formal training.  "Jordin didn't have to mention my name, " says Black.  "But at least acknowledge you had training. " Paris – Not-So-Hot Heiress Jailbird-to-be Paris Hilton can't play in the same league as other heiresses, according to one celeb photographer, and as a result, he's 86ing her from his book of beautiful women who got everything handed to them on a silver platter. Fancy photog Roger Moenks says that he was planning to shoot Paris for  "Inheriting Beauty, " a photobook that was to include Dylan Lauren, Roberta Armani, Casey Johnson, and their ilk. But the lensman  "bounced Paris by unanimous vote, " says Moenks' agent in Page Six.  "She tried to play society like a game of three-card monte. Let's hear it for high standards. " Ouch. Ozzy -- Sanjaya's a  "Hairstyle-Challenged " Idiot Ozzy Osbourne backed out of performing on the  "American Idol " finale after he found out he'd be performing with Sanjaya Malakar, whom he referred to as  "a hairstyle-challenged idiot, " reports Page Six. If  "Idol " producers were ever worried about Osbourne's onstage behavior, though, they needn't have. He tells Details,  "I very rarely went onstage loaded. At the end of a show -- that's when I'd get Vicodin'd. " But, admits Ozzy,  "I was f**king out of my tree, " at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2002.  Party Favors: Miss USA Booed All Night -- and All Day -- in Mexico ... Time to Eat the Doughnuts for Larry King ... Tan Man Hamilton Loves His Lillet It's been a tough week for Miss USA Rachel Smith. Not only did she suffer the indignity of the ass-bruising fall seen 'round the world, she was also booed constantly during her trip, including one appearance in which she wore an Elvis-style suit in downtown Mexico City. ... Larry King was spotted chowing on doughnuts with wife Shawn at fried-dough emporium Frittelli's in Beverly Hills, where the Rock recently ordered no less than 24 peanut-butter-and-jelly doughnuts, his personal fave, for a cocktail party. ... It's just too perfect -- George Hamilton, well-bronzed emblem of the louche life, enjoying a little Lillet at L.A.'s Celadon during a visit last week along with tuna tartar lollipops and sesame shrimp toast.

It seems like Katy Perry and Taylor Swift aren’t ready to end their ongoing feud just yet.

When speaking to Entertainment Weekly about her upcoming album, Perry opened up about whether she will ever respond to Swift’s 1989 hit, “Bad Blood,” which many fans assumed was about their infamous fallout. Though the “Bon Appetit” singer insisted “there is no one thing that’s calling out any one person” on her new record, she didn’t necessarily rule out the possibility of shade in the near future.
“One thing to note is: You can’t mistake kindness for weakness and don’t come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that’s not to any one person and don’t quote me that it is, because it’s not. It’s not about that,” she said. “Honestly, when women come together and they decide to unite, this world is going to be a better place. Period end of story. But, let me say this: Everything has a reaction or a consequence so don’t forget about that, okay, honey. [Laughs] We got to keep it real, honey.”

“This record is about me being seen and heard so that I can see and hear everyone else! It’s not even about me! It’s about everything that I see out there that I digest,” she continued. “I think there’s a healing in it for me and vulnerability. If people want to connect and be healed and feel vulnerable and feel empowered and strong, God bless and here it is.”
Last year, Perry hinted about settling her feud with the “Shake It Off” songstress, tweeting she’ll collaborate with Swift “if she says sorry.”
Though neither have ever confirmed that “Bad Blood” is truly about their beef, fans figured out the song was calling out Perry after Swift told Rolling Stone the diss track was about a female singer who “did something so horrible, I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.'”

“She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour,” Swift, whose backup dancers went on to work on Perry’s Prismatic World Tour, said. “She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me.”
At the time, Perry seemingly responded by writing in a shady subtweet, “Watch out for the Regina George in sheep’s clothing.”
Something tells us this feud is far from over.

After waiting with bated breath, fans are finally getting the first look at the upcoming Love Actually reunion special.

Featuring Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and more, the first full-length trailer brings back the 2003 flick’s famous cue cards as the cast asks, “Which one of us has aged best?”
Set years after the events from the rom-com classic, the highly-anticipated follow-up was created as part of 2017’s Red Nose Day campaign, an annual charity telethon dedicated to raising funds for children living in poverty. The short film will premiere on BBC One in the U.K. on March 24.
Much of the original lineup are set to returning, including Colin Firth, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson. As previously reported, Emma Thompson bowed out of the project as she felt it was “too sad” and “too soon” to revisit her role following the death of her dear friend and onscreen husband, Alan Rickman.
“I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to Love Actually, but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to,” Richard Curtis, one of screenwriters for the first movie, said in a press release. “We hope to make something that’ll be fun — very much in the spirit of the original film and of Red Nose Day.”

After eating -- and probably lots of drinking -- inside the posh eatery, Carey started getting down and dirty with her BFF,  "Showgirls " star Rena Riffel, as shocked patrons gaped in disbelief. After Carey kissed her pal on the neck and quickly whispered something in her ear, she then lifted Riffel's skirt and exposed Rena's landing strip ... four separate times!Before leaving, Carey shouted,  "We're so never allowed back to Mr. Chow's.

Neil Patrick Harris Calls Out James Woods After Insensitive Tweet About 10-Year-Old Boy/n
Neil Patrick Harris isn't impressed with James Woods' controversial tweet.Over the weekend, the actor took to social media where he shared a picture of a family at the Orange County Pride Parade in Southern California.The photo featured two parents holding individual signs that demonstrated their love for their son. "I love my gender creative son," one poster read. Another added, "My son wears dresses & makeup…get over it."James, who recently starred in Family Guy and Ray Donovan, decided to post the family's picture with an aggressive tweet."This is sweet," he wrote. "Wait until this poor kid grows up, realizes what you've done, and stuffs both of you dismembered into a freezer in the garage."

On Tuesday afternoon, Neil decided not to stay quiet. Instead he shared the controversial tweet with his own message."Utterly ignorant and classless, Mr. Woods," the How I Met Your Mother star wrote to his followers. "I'm friends with this family. You know not of what you speak, and should be ashamed of yourself."The Human Rights Campaign would also chime in and respond to Neil's message. "Thank you @ActuallyNPH for taking a stand against this vulgar & hateful statement," the civil rights organization shared. "All children should be accepted & loved for who they are."Before becoming a hot topic, the mother in the family photo blogged about her "gender creative son's" first Pride.  In her website called Raising My Rainbow, mom Lori Duron detailed the unforgettable experience.

"The festival was everything C.J. hoped it would be and then some," she wrote. "My sweet, fabulous, rainbow boy has never received so many compliments. He's used to getting stares and whispers when we're out in public. He's not used to getting the smiles, hugs and encouragement he received at Pride."As for what C.J. loved most about Pride, Lori was happy to share her son's answer."I liked the vibe. I liked all the colors. But, most of all, I liked all of the people," he explained. "Nobody judges anybody. You can just be who you want to be. There should be Pride every week, because it's so much fun."

Director Herbert Ross Dies/n
Hollywood veteran Herbert Ross, director of Footloose, Funny Lady and The Goodbye Girl, died of heart failure Tuesday in New York. He was reported to be 76.                  Often dubbed a women's director, although he hated to be so categorized, Ross' talent showcased  Hollywood ladies of all types, from Barbra Streisand (who headlined Funny Lady in 1975) to Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft (the dance diva duo of 1977's The Turning Point) to Julia Roberts, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis and Sally Field (the ensemble cast of 1988's Steel Magnolias) to Drew Barrymore, Mary-Louise Parker  and Whoopi Goldberg (the oddball trio of Boys on the Side, his final film in 1995).                  Despite his label, however, he could also handle the guys.  His directing debut,  the musical Goodbye Mr. Chips, starred Peter O'Toole;  Walter Matthau and George Burns headlined his version of Neil Simon's The Sunshine Boys; Richard Dreyfuss was Marsha Mason's costar in the Simon hit The Goodbye Girl; Michael J. Fox played the lead in The Secret of My Success; and ballet great Mikhail Baryshnikov made his acting debut in Turning Point.                  Dance was Ross' first love and lasting legacy. Born in Brooklyn (biographies list his birth year variously as 1935 or 1937) and raised in Miami, he studied classical and modern dance. He worked as a chorus boy in Broadway musicals.  His first wife, Nora Kaye, was a prima ballerina and he became a choreographer with the American Ballet Theater and later on Broadway and for television.                   He worked first in Hollywood as a choreographer and dance director, most notably on the 1967 musical version of Doctor Doolittle and Streisand's 1968 movie debut as Fanny Brice in Funny Girl, directed by the famed William Wyler.   Ross had choreographed the ingenue Streisand in her Broadway stage debut, I Can Get It For You Wholesale, and, besides directing her in the Brice bio sequel Funny Lady,  they also collaborated on the 1970 romance flick The Owl and the Pussycat.                  MacLaine referred to Ross as  "a [dance] gypsy,"  telling the Los Angeles Times, "Herbert was a great director because he took his knowledge of dance into the movement of acting. He mastered flamboyance and sensitivity."                  Ross was indeed a combination of those qualities, a tall, elegant man with good manners but a commanding determination, who didn't suffer fools gladly.                  It was his determination, in partnership with Kaye, that enabled the ballet story The Turning Point to become a mainstream movie.  "We both feel a tremendous responsibility to the ballet, and I believe we've represented it correctly," said Ross, whose other ballet films, Dancers and Nijinsky, failed to generate much box-office interest. On the flip side, his latter-day dance flick Footloose was a monster hit.                  Ross perhaps hit his professional peak in 1977. Two of his films, The Turning Point and The Goodbye Girl, received Best Picture Oscar nominations, but lost to Annie Hall, starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton--a twosome Ross had directed in the Allen-scripted 1972 comedy romance Play It Again, Sam.  Ross also received a Best Director Oscar nod for Turning Point but lost out to Allen. That same year he also returned to Broadway to direct Neil Simon's comedy Chapter Two. His close association with the prolific playwright also included the movies California Suite, I Ought to Be in Pictures and Max Dugan Returns.                   Kaye died of cancer in 1987.

Meek Mill Accuses Wrong Guy of Killing Alton Sterling/nMeek Mill and thousands of others fell for an Internet hoax and ended up ripping into a guy who is NOT one of the Baton Rouge cops who shot Alton Sterling. Robert Kinnison says he's been receiving death threats after his image went viral following Sterling's death. Kinnison is a trucker from Arizona and Donald Trump supporter ... but says someone trolled him and it's not the first time. He says someone online frequently posts a pic of him holding his gun after high-profile shooting incidents. This time the meme went viral, and Meek fell for it ... sharing the image on his IG page. According to Baton Rouge PD, the cops involved in the Alton Sterling slaying are actually named Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II.  Kinnison's been trying to clear his name in videos he's posting online.  pic.twitter.com /CSLZ34sykH — Robert J.

Married Man Chris Rock Gives Girlfriend A HUGE Rock! Secretly Engaged?/n
Comedian Chris Rock has put a dazzling ring on his girlfriend’s finger — even though he’s still legally married!
The smitten funnyman, 51, and sexy 33-year-old CSI: Miami star Megalyn Echikunwoke have lived together since April.
“Chris and Megalyn are deeply in love,” an insider told Radar. “They’re soul mates who plan to spend eternity together. I know it sounds silly, but it’s true. They were born to be together.” A rep for the comic insisted that he was not engaged and the ring is Echikunwoke’s own. But they still seem to be going strong.
PHOTOS: Extravagance: 10 Most Outrageous Celebrity Proposal Engagement Photos
Only problem? Rock’s divorce duel with wife Malaak Compton is still raging, with no clear end in sight.
The Grown Ups star reportedly separated from Compton, 47, nearly four years ago. However, he didn’t officially file for divorce from the mother of his children, Lola, 13, and Zahra, 12, until December 2014.
The already nasty split took an ugly turn last summer, when it was revealed that the couple prenup had expired during the course of their 19-year marriage, and Rock’s gargantuan $70 million fortune is now on the line.
PHOTOS: The 10 Hottest Celebrity Engagement Rings Of The Moment
The struggle for that sizable sum continues. But is Rock the marrying kind?
In 2004, he shamelessly spilled to shock jock Howard Stern that after a sizzling one-night stand, a woman conned him into believing he had gotten her pregnant!
Rock also divulged to Stern that he was even forced to pay the woman a small fortune, and it was not until later that the comedian learned that the same woman was conspiring with a man with the intent to scam African-American celebrities out of money, in a case being investigated by the FBI.

The actor even compared the woman’s sexual prowess to a top professional basketball coach, proudly exclaiming to Stern, “This girl was the Pat Riley of sex! She can get a performance out of you that you didn’t know you had!”
But despite Echikunwoke’s new bling, a source close to the famous funnyman admitted to Radar, “Chris just isn’t the kind of guy who should be married.”

Mario Lopez Sued For Breach Of Contract & Fraud, Promoter Wants More Than $50K/n
Extra host Mario Lopez is being sued by a Philadelphia promoter after he allegedly failed to show at a paid appearance, and RadarOnline.com has exclusively obtained the lawsuit.
According to Robert “Bobby” Capone, he hired Lopez to host an event on October 27, 2012 at The Roxy and/or Penn’s Landing Caterers for an agreed fee of $15,000.
EXCLUSIVE DOCUMENTS: Mario Lopez Sued For Breach Of Contract & Fraud
“Pursuant to the agreement, the Plaintiff paid to the defendant an advance of Eight Thousand ($8,000.00) dollar on or about July 16, 2012,” the lawsuit states.
“On or about October 10, 2012 the Plaintiff was advised by, the Defendant and/or his representative that the Defendant would not be honoring the aforesaid agreement with the plaintiff because of ‘new commitments’ that have ‘just arose’.”
The lawsuit, filed on March 28, 2013, claims that Lopez breached the agreement for no reason “other than to reap temporary financial gain and notoriety at the expense of the Plaintiff.”

 Radar Told You First! Duggars Announce Split Between Josiah & Girlfriend Marjorie.../n
Just one day after RadarOnline.com reported an apparent split between teen Josiah Duggar and girlfriend Marjorie Jackson, the Duggar family confirmed the breakup on their official Facebook page.
“Both Josiah and Marjorie have enjoyed getting to know each other and to build their friendship over the past months,” this morning’s post read. “A few weeks ago Marjorie and Josiah agreed to end their courtship, keeping in step with what they believe the Lord’s will is.”
“Both are thankful for the time getting to know each other, and their families continue to enjoy each other’s company and close friendship.”

As Radar revealed, 18-year-old Josiah abruptly stopped posting photos of Jackson, 17, on Instagram in late May— just days before his older brother Josh‘s sex abuse scandal shocked the public.
The couple had previously been very open about their Christian courtship, and the young blogger even made an appearance on the family’s TLC reality show in April.
One month later, a leaked police report accused Josh, 27, of molesting five minor females, including at least two of his sisters, as a teen.

Jackson’s parents Greg and Analucia did not respond to Radar’s calls for comment on the split, and so far, the writer has remained mum about the breakup.
But she may be telling all in the upcoming weeks.
After a year hiatus from blogging, Jackson announced her return on July 24.
“I’m back to the blogging world and you won’t want to miss the great posts to come!” she wrote.

Katherine Jackson Tells The Judge, Trent's So Bad I'm Hiding Out in London/nKatherine Jackson -- or someone claiming to be Katherine Jackson -- has doubled down in the family war, claiming again Michael's cousin, Trent, has been stealing from and bullying the matriarch.  Katherine has been MIA for months after allegedly leveling claims Trent has pilfered $40k out of her bank account and manipulated her into buying him a Cadillac. She's also claimed elder abuse. Trent has said it's all BS ... that Katherine isn't really driving this, but rather it's Jermaine and some of her other kids in order to get control of MJ's Estate. In the new declaration -- obtained by TMZ -- Katherine says she's in London because she's scared to come home for fear Trent will now seek revenge on her. She says she's now filled with stress and anxiety, and she's now taking new meds to cope. Katherine also says she's had meeting with social workers from Adult Protective Services and they will vouch for the authenticity of her claims. The judge in the case is deciding whether he'll require Katherine's presence in court for the case against Trent to go forward./n

The Weeknd’s new single from his third studio album just happens to be prime Brangelina clickbait.

Following the artist’s roll-out of his cover art and shorter hair (RIP Abel Tesfaye’s crashing riptide), The Weeknd released “Starboy,” his brand new single that references Brad Pitt. Though the track does not reference Pitt’s pending divorce, as filed by Angelina Jolie, it’s still a little spooky that the entry of these two events into the world just happened to coincide.

Mariah Carey's Lambs Are Uniting With Taylor Swift's Swifties To Stop Despacito From Breaking Hot 100 Record!/n

Taylor Swift to the rescue!!
It appears as though Mariah Carey's stans are rallying behind Miz Swift as she prepares to drop the first single from Reputation on Thursday evening. Why?? Well, because, MiMi's chart topper One Sweet Day is at risk of being dethroned as the longest-running No.1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Before we continue, let us give you some context. Back in 1996, the famed diva collaborated with Boyz II Men for a beautiful ballad and it dominated the chart for a mind-blowing 16 weeks. Mariah has kept this record for more than 20 years!!!
Now Justin Bieber's collab with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee (Despacito, duh) is threatening Carey's record as the track has spent 15 weeks on the chart. Obviously, this fact has sent Mariah's lambs into a panic (below).

Thankfully, Mariah's stans have a game plan on how to keep the A-lister's record — and Taylor plays a BIG part in the scheme. As Tay Tay is slated to drop a new single later tonight, the Lambs have chosen to stan the blonde pop princess (below) in order to give it enough traction to keep Despacito from dethroning One Sweet Day.

The Lost Audiotape: James Garner REVEALS His One True Love/n
James Garner portrayed a slew of memorable characters in his almost 60-year career, but his most treasured role was that of husband, and his 57-year marriage to Lois Clarke remains one of Hollywood’s sweetest love stories.
RADAR has unearthed a long-lost audio clip in which a besotted James can be heard pouring out his heart as he expresses his devotion to Lois.
A chance meeting at a friend’s home in 1956 set the stage for “The Rockford Files” star to meet the woman who would change his life forever.
“I just flipped out over this girl. She was gorgeous!” James recalls in the forgotten recording. “The night of the party at this friend’s [place], I had gone alone and she had gone alone. I asked her to dinner. We went to dinner that night, and we went out every night for the next two weeks.”

Each evening was more magical than the last, and after a whirlwind, 14-day courtship, the two were wed.
James, who was 71 at the time of the recording, already had more than 40 blissful years of marriage to look back on, but their lifelong union was not without its challenges.
During his career, charismatic James was surrounded by the most stunning actresses in Hollywood, but like a true maverick, he never stepped out on his one and only.
James did confess that sparks flew between himself and Doris Day during the filming of “The Thrill of It All” (1963), but he stayed loyal to his bride.

“If I had not been married I would have tried to carry forward after hours,” admits James.
Lois had to withstand the Hollywood rumor mill but remained unfazed and a steadfast defender of her spouse. A proud James remarks, “She’s tough. She’s very tough.”
While the pair did take a break from 1979 until 1981, their beautiful bond endured. James and Lois remained together until the end, when he passed at age 86 in 2014.

During the course of their marriage, James adopted Lois’ first daughter, Kimberly, who suffered from polio. They also had a daughter together, whom they named Greta.
It wasn’t just a doting James that made their legendary love work. He admits in the discovered clip that he was Lois’ world: “She takes care of me. My life is so good because she sees that I’m comfortable and I have what I need. That’s her job, that’s her life.”

Happy Halloween, trick-or-treaters! And wow, do we have a pillowcase full o' spoiler goodies for everyone! And we promise, no razor blades whatsoever.On Gossip Girl, someone is getting snapped into handcuffs, and not in the kinky way. Barney will be questioning his commitment to Nora on How I Met Your Mother, and both Parks and Recreation and True Blood are giving us flashbacks to the childhoods of their leading ladies! All that, plus the best Glee question we've ever gotten, in this week's Spoiler Chat…

Jackie: Got any Gossip Girl goodies for us?As you can see in the photo, Blair (Leighton Meester) gets into a bit of trouble at her bachelorette party after seemingly joking around with a cop. Yeah, not one of her best ideas. We're hearing both Chuck (Ed Westwick) and Dan (Penn Badgley) are on the scene to try and help Queen B, but she's still arrested anyway. We smell major drama! And it smells freaking delicious.Natalie: What's coming up for Charlie/Ivy on Gossip Girl?! Secrets are no fun unless you share with everyone. Yes, Ivy's (Kaylee   Defer) secret is coming out! You really didn't think she could hide who   she really is forever, did you? Fortunately, she and Carol (Sheila   Kelley) find a way to avoid disaster and cement Ivy's place on the UES.Betty: Happy Halloween! As a treat, can we have HIMYM scoop?Sure thing! We finally get to meet the Barney's brother James' (Wayne Brady) husband in the Thanksgiving episode. And it's possible we'll see much more of him after Turkey Day.

Amanda in San Diego, Calif.: I am so over Nora and Barney on HIMYM. Are they gonna break up soon?Speculate with this: Someone from Barney's past shows up in present day to basically scare Barney (Neil Patrick Harris)   out of ever settling down and having kids. That might be enough to  send  Barney running from his committed relationship with Nora. But  would  that make him run directly into another relationship with Robin?Gale in Montana: Is it true that Amy and Sheldon are heading for trouble on Big Bang Theory?Seems to be the case. In an upcoming episode, Sheldon has to grill an inept comic book store employee on the whereabouts of his lady. Turns out, when you're digging for info you don't really want to find, the result is always heartbreaking.Nancy in Seattle: Is Glee canceled? It isn't on anymore. There was a big, splashy season opener, one follow-up episode, then... nothing. What's the deal?Yes, Glee has been canceled. Fox wants to turn it into a cartoon series starring Lea Michele as a singing pony. Or we're kidding about all of this, because clearly Glee has just been on hiatus for the past few weeks. It returns tomorrow, and you can sneak a peek at a new musical number right here. P.S.: How do you decorate that rock you live under?

CubraLibra: Please tell me that a Puck-Shelby romance is a trick and not treat on Glee? That would just be too creepy.Sorry, we hear this is definitely more treat (for Puck) then trick. Remember, Puck (Mark Salling)   has a thing for older ladies due to his pool-cleaning duties. Did you   forget about that aspect of his personality? Don't worry, an upcoming   episode will remind you.mstaradosh: How racy is episode 5? Which couple is to blame for the TV-14 rating? ;) #gleeWe   can't tell you much about the raciness factor, but we can confirm the   safety factor! Because when you have sex you can pregnant and die. Yes,   our first-timers will be using protection. High five for condoms,  y'all!Lauren: Whatcha got on Parks and Rec?The man Leslie (Amy Poehler) is campaigning against is named Billy Newport, and he has only one campaign strategy: He's very handsome.   So handsome, in fact, that even Leslie's own friends are charmed by   him! Also, we get to flashback and check out Leslie as a 12-year-old.   Who else thinks she was campaigning for healthier foods in the cafeteria   back then?

@duttweid: I'm DYING for Dexter spoilers! What is up with the professor? People are guessing he's really a ghost...I don't buy that. We don't buy it either—that would require a lot of Sixth Sense-style revisions of his scenes with Travis (Colin Hanks). But if you're dying (sorry) to see a ghost on Dexter, you don't have long to wait: Next week, Dexter's (Michael C. Hall) past comes back to haunt him...literally. And it ain't daddy.Rr12390: Any scoop on The Good Wife?Girl power alert: Jennifer Carpenter shot her guest spot on Friday, and Amy Sedaris is now shooting her multi-episode arc too. While promoting her movie Puss in Boots, Amy told us she's a fan of the show and that most of her scenes are with Alan Cumming.  (She will play a rival lobbyist to Eli.) "We just hit it off  instantly," Amy says of Alan, while adding that her character is "nice  at first but then you find out later what I'm actually doing."Joey in Columbus, Ohio: Happy Endings is killing me this season! I love it. What's coming up?Would you believe us if we told you the writers might be exploring a possible attraction between Penny and…Dave?! In an upcoming episode, both Penny (Casey Wilson) and Dave (Zachary Knighton) go on dates with the other's therapists, and both therapists believe that P and D's commitment issues stem from unresolved tension between the two friends. Is it for real? Guess we'll find out soon enough. 

Ronnie in Anaheim, Calif: Morgan in Chuck's season premiere was really funny, but I feel like Chuck should be the one with the Intersect.We're totally picking up what you're putting down, but now it's Morgan's (Joshua Gomez)  time to shine. In the week's episode, an overly eager Morgan is willing  to do whatever it takes to be taken seriously (like costing Carmichael  Industries $150,000) Yikes! But while Morgan is busy "zooming," Chuck (Zachary Levi)  is beginning to notice some very strange changes in his BFF's  personality. For example: Morgan seriously asks who Luke Skywalker is.  Could the Intersect be more of a foe than friend this season? Dun-dun-dun!Ellie in Albuquerque: I'm officially burnt out on  Halloween episodes, when do we get to start hearing about the Christmas  ones?Hold your reindeers! We've got you covered. We just visited the set of Modern Family for their holiday episode and witnessed a festively fun scene with the  entire cast in one room, including the totally adorbs pup Stella. Sarah Hyland tells us to expect plenty of merriment. "We realize that the whole  family is doing their separate things and this is the last day that  we're going to be together before actual Christmas starts, so we're  trying to do an Express Christmas thing. Meanwhile, we're in bathing  suits, so we're going to have to pull it all together." Sounds fantastic!

Jason in Somerville, Mass.: Is Lori pregnant on The Walking Dead? Gotta know if they're gonna follow the comic books on this one. Get ready to wave your magic pregnancy wand, because the answer to your question—either a blue plus or minus—will be revealed next week.Mayracansigno: You guys always have the best scoops, so tell me, what's coming up on CSI: Miami?Flattery will get you absolutely everywhere. Seriously, might as well drop out of school now. Anyway, the folks over at CSI: Miami are looking to cast a child psychologist who helps with the investigation of a brutal murder at a kindergarten beauty show. Sure, the murder is a crime, but so is a beauty pageant for kindergartners, right?Whorelips: I know it's a little early, but what about some exclusive scoop on #TrueBlood?Never too early for True Blood scoop. The season-five premiere of True Blood will have a flashback to Sookie's (Anna Paquin) childhood, and we get to see her use her powers in a deliciously evil way to embarrass a couple of playground bullies. What did they do to piss her off? They don't pick her for their kickball team! That is a wound that burns deep forever, kids…so be nice when playing kickball!Jarrod in Bloomington, Ind.: I heard season five will be the last one for True Blood. Tell me it's not true. I will flip out!Not according to Stephen Moyer, and he's a pretty important guy on T.B. "There is certainly enough material for us to keep going and going," he tells us. "And as you know, television contracts are six years, so I don't think there is any need for it to be the last season. I don't see any need or reason for it to stop when it is as successful as it is." Feel better?

secret_circle: You know we love your Secret Circle scoop, so feel free to his us with more!Your wish is our command! While Chris Zylka tells us "Cassie (Britt Robertson) is beautiful enough to just say 'OK, bye witch hunters!", Jake will stay in league with them for the time being due to his complicated relationship with Isaac (J.R. Bourne). "The way I care and that Isaac cares for me…it really is going to be sort of the middle ground of what is going to happen, what choices he is going to make, and it plays off better and better with the witch hunters in every episode."

Alexis in Cambridge, Ohio: I wasn't sure at first, but you were right! Grimm was soo good on Friday! New fave for sure.Ooh, so tempted to say "Told you so!" but we'll just give you some scoop instead.  As you know, we were recently on the set of Grimm and talked with Bitsie Tulloch, who gave us some insight to Juliette's vague background: "I am a veterinarian on the show, which hasn't come into play too much, but down the road I know that it is going to come in handy as far as some of the creatures are concerned." Hmmm...maybe Nick's (David Giuntoli) new Blutbad ally Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) is going to need some fixin' up this season?Sarah: Obsessed with Hart of Dixie! Anything good coming up for my favorite couple, Zoe and Wade?Good? We're not sure. Hilarious? Definitely. Zoe (Rachel Bilson) and Wade (Wilson Bethel) will soon try to sabotage each other's dating attempts, and they get pretty childish about it. It seems Wade isn't too thrilled to see Zoe take an interest in Judson, a vet.Monica: Anything on Community? It's been fantastic the past two weeks. Apparently not fantastic enough for Barbra Streisand! Joel McHale tells us that they've asked Babs to guest star on Community "like 900 times." He's dying for her to play his mom.Zach: Any Nikita news?Get ready to say hello to another guardian! If you thought Owen (Devon Sawa) was intense when you first met him, well, you ain't seen nothing yet. Let's just say he's not giving up his black box so easily.

Jenny in Hershey, Pa.: Is Addie really dead on American Horror Story?It seems to be that way. In the second part of the Halloween episode, Addie does not pop back up. And her grieving mother Constance (Jessica Lange) decides to put all her rage toward blaming someone other than whoever the driver was…and that someone is Violet (Taissa Farmiga).Tracy: I miss New Girl! Give me some scoop to tide me over!Prepare to meet the gang's super serious and scary landlord and expect things to get really weird (and hilarious) when Jess (Zooey Deschanel) and Nick (Jake Johnson) decide to drink with him.Nicole in Salem, Ore.: Is it true that Jo on CSI: NY has a fight scene with a convicted rapist?  Oh yeah, it's true! We were on set of CSI: NY on the day of the fight, and it was intense! Jason Wiles plays a suspected rapist for a three-episode arc and describes his character as "a rapist, but he's violent too and he's physical and he beats people up and he gets kicks doing that." Sela Ward tells us that being in a fight scene gave her a sense of déjà vu, "It reminded so much of the fugitive where I played Harrison Ford's wife and the character's killed at the beginning of the movie, and that whole sequence of the fight scene, the struggle and bludgeoning and that sort of thing and in that case dying, it reminded me very much of that." We're excited and a little scared to see these three episodes!DialPforPete: Suburgatory?Prepare yourselves for a shocker: Tessa (Jane Levy) and Dalia (Carly Chaikin) will be interested in the same guy at school! Dahlia is less than thrilled when the guy seems to take an interest in Tessa. Let the games begin!Lauren: I'll take anything you got on Pan Am!Buckle up, people, because you're about to experience some turbulence via an awkward family dinner at Dean's (Mike Vogel) parents house. Yes, that's right. You'll soon meet Dean's parents, who still think he is dating Bridget. Like we said: awkward.—Additional reporting by Jenna  Mullins, Leanne Aguilera, Tierney  Bricker, Drusilla Moorhouse and Marc Malkin

Naomi Watts Caught a Sneaky Fan Taking Her Photo Last Year and the Internet Is Just Finding Out About It The Internet went into an uproar Monday night when fans of Naomi Watts finally put the pieces together for the best revenge picture of a.../n
The Internet went into an uproar Monday night when fans of Naomi Watts finally put the pieces together for the best revenge picture of all time. Back in June 2016, Naomi posted a clever Instagram photo while taking the subway in New York. The The Book of Henry star let her 669,000 Instagram followers know YES! she does see you trying to snag a photo of her by captioning the post, "Think you're pretty sneaky? #gotyou #snap #subwayscenes."So, who is the girl in green?

The original photo was taken by Naomi fan and family photographer Aubrey Lofgren of Aubrey Lofgren Photography. Aubrey was in New York on vacation when she spotted her favorite actress on the subway. Similar to Naomi, Aubrey posted her photo on Instagram. However, her caption was a tad different in tone, "The beautiful Naomi Watts on the subway today. #fanningout #hlclannyc2016."While this may seem like old news, it wasn't until yesterday on Twitter when everyone found the reciprocated photos and put them side by side. The resurfacing of these Instagram posts naturally had everyone buzzing online. 

@subsahaaron tweeted, "I'm ready for Naomi Watts to have her own renaissance." Meanwhile, those waking up to the hilarious discovery are finding enjoyment in the payback too. @PurplePomp tweeted Tuesday morning, "It's way too early to gush about naomi watts. I'll do it after breakfast." The Aussie actress—best-known for her more serious roles—isn't the only celebrity to have caught a sneaky snapper. Cole Sprouse is known for taking photos of people trying to get their shot of the Disney star. And Daniel Radcliffe once wore the same outfit every day for months so paparazzi would stop trying to take his photo. While Twitter didn't make the connection until last night, back in June Aubrey re-posted Naomi's photo with the caption, "Busted. #hlclannyc2016 #naomiwatts."

Ben Affleck’s Batman character back, but many aren’t too happy to see him in a new suit.

The actor, who was spotted taking a smoke break on Thursday (March 23, 2017) in Los Angeles, recently shared an image of him in the upcoming Justice League movie.

Much to fans’ disappointment, Affleck’s new Batman costume failed to impress — with some drawing comparisons to George Clooney’s getup from the much-derided Batman & Robin. (Remember those Batsuit nipples?)

Okay I’m sorry but this seriously looks like George Clooney’s second Batsuit! #BatmanAndRobin #JusticeLeague #Batman https://t.co/6nYuWxFTcQ

Questionable costume aside, fans were still stoked for Affleck to reprise his role as the Caped Crusader in the new superhero flick.

That 20 second tease of Ben Affleck as Batman for Justice League was all I need to continue to be alive.
Still hate my ex though.

ALERT: New Details Have Dropped About Taylor Swift's New Music, The VMAs, & More!!/n

This is not a drill, Swifties!
According to US Weekly sources, Taylor Swift IS dropping a new single this Friday (August 25) and will release an accompanying music video later this week.
Related: This Taylor Parody Account Is SO Good!
An insider revealed:

"The song is poppy."
A second source says the Shake It Off musician will release her sixth album in the near future, explaining: 

"She's being very secretive about it, but it's going to be a really good one."
Also of note, it's said Joe Alwyn's girlfriend will attend the 2017 VMAs — hosted by frenemy Katy Perry! Mmhmmm…
As we reported, after deleting all the content from her social media pages, the 27-year-old confused fans on Monday when she posted a cryptic video where an unidentifiable animal slithers its tail.
While many believe the creature is a snake (in reference to the #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty drama with Kim Kardashian), Joseph Mendelson, Ph.D. — director of research at Zoo Atlanta — thinks otherwise.
He told Inverse:

"That is not a snake, nor other reptile… It actually changes the length of its body, which is what worms or octopus tentacles do. Snakes, even the couple of really odd ones out there, can't technically accomplish this."
Luke Linhoff, a Ph.D. candidate at Florida International University, is also doubtful.

"Even the most dragon-y, dragon-like snake I know, Xenodermus javanicus, doesn't look like that."
Linhoff thinks it's either an octopus leg or a "funny-looking" ophiuroid also known as a brittle star. He continues:

"But let's be honest… I'm guessing T-Swifty has just been watching a lot of Game of Thrones and wants to do some 'dragon from the ashes' sort of PR stunt."
Snake or not, we CANNOT WAIT for Taylor's new song!

Letterman Defendant Uses Tiger Defense/nThe guy who allegedly masterminded an extortion plot against David Letterman is now using the Tiger Woods scandal as precedent to get the charges against him thrown out ..according to new documents obtained by TMZ.Robert Halderman's lawyer, Gerald Shargel, filed legal papers asking that the charges against his client be dismissed. In the papers, Shargel notes that when news of Tiger's infidelity surfaced, Mistress #1, Rachel Uchitel, reportedly inked a multi-million dollar settlement in return for her silence -- with the help of Gloria Allred.Shargel notes,  "Their behavior was capitalist, not criminal. "Halderman's lawyer says his client essentially just  "offered to sell his very marketable story to David Letterman. " Shargel says that celebrity misdeeds have  "significant fair market value " and they are  "routinely suppressed through private business arrangements. "Shargel's point -- Rachel and Gloria didn't get prosecuted, so why should Halderman?

But the proof is in the pictures ! As fans know, the Chrisley Knows Best teen queen has been posting non-stop photos of her and Kennard, 21, all over her social media pages (which include Instagram, Twitter and Facebook) since the two first became an official couple at the end of June.
And now all of the photos she posted are gone ,and the only ones that remain are one shot of the two of them on his Instagram.
As Radar previously reported, Kennard left his longtime girlfriend, hometown beauty Anna Castro, to be with Chrisley.

According to the source, Kennard may have realized that he made a mistake.
“Savannah thinks that Luke is getting back together with Anna, and she may be right,” the source added.
On August 6 – the day after the Chrisley family arrived home from their tropical vacation – Savannahposted a heartbreaking message on Facebook, along with a photo of her walking solo on the beach.





 Huge thanks to @tamarbraxton for posting this today…I love when the right things show up at the right time! Definitely needed this today…a lot of times we all find ourselves in a "WHY? And WHAT?" state of life. Why me? What did I do to deserve this? Why God? What is your plan? We spend a lot of time asking A LOT of questions…but imagine how much different the outcome would be and how much quicker it would come if we stopped questioning and just allowed God to do His work…1 Corinthian 10:13 says, "No test or temptation that comes your way is beyond the course of what others have had to face. All you need to remember is that God will never let you down; he’ll never let you be pushed past your limit; he’ll always be there to help you come through it." So no matter what you're going through right now…turn to HIM! Let Him do the work that He has promised…because He has promised that He will never give us more than we can bare. #thankyouLord ❤️

‘Making a Murderer’ May Be Getting a Second Season/n





                    Steven Avery Speaks Out From Prison
                







The 'Making a Murderer' subject believes the real killer is still out there.

                    Steven Avery's Brother Reveals New Details About the Night Teresa Halbach Was Murdered
                







This could change everything.

Prepare for more binge-watching.

The filmmakers behind the hugely popular Making a Murderer have taken the preliminary steps to make new installments for Netflix’s documentary series about Steven Avery, a man who has been convicted of killing photographer Teresa Halbach following an earlier wrongful 18-year imprisonment for a crime he did not commit.
During a Stranger Than Fiction panel discussion at New York’s IFC Center on last Thursday (Feb. 25, 2016), directors Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos revealed they have spoken to Avery’s new lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, about continuing to document Avery’s story and his struggle to find justice for a murder he insists he did not commit.
“From our perspective this story is obviously not over,” Ricciardi said [via Variety]. “It’s real life and [Avery’s and nephew Brendan Dassey’s] cases are both still pending. We have no idea when the magistrate will make a decision in Brendan’s case. We do know that two potential outcomes are that the judge could order Brendan’s release or he could order a new trial. So we are on the edge of seats about that. To the extent that there are significant developments, we would like to continue documenting this.”

However, the filmmakers do foresee difficulties in getting access again given that many Manitowoc County residents are said to be unhappy with how Wisconsin was portrayed on the show.
“There is a lot of hostility toward these two women in Wisconsin,” panelist and Avery’s civil lawyer, Stephen M. Glynn, said. “The theory is that have played Wisconsin unfairly. But among those people who think and are a little more educated and thoughtful about these sorts of issues, there is appreciation.”
Making a Murderer centered around the judicial process and alleged mishandling of Avery’s 2005 conviction. After its premiere, the 10-part docu-series gained so much attention that President Barack Obama had make a statement about the case and respond to a petition to pardon Avery.
“I’ve never really dealt with the press before except in the context of making the film,” Ricciardi said. “So to be the subject is different, but we are grateful that people have watched and engaged with the series because we made it to promote a dialogue. I can’t keep up with all the headlines and the tweets and I certainly can’t engage with all of it. The series has in many ways taken on a life of its own.”
Since Making a Murderer’s release, Avery’s former fiancée, Jodi Stachowski, revealed she believes her ex is guilty of murder. Meanwhile, Avery’s other ex-fiancée, Sandy Greenman, said he is innocent.
Avery is currently serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He continues to maintain his innocence, recently writing in a letter to the press, “The real killer is still out there. Who is he stalking now? I am really innocent of this case and that is the truth!!! The truth will set me free!!!!!!!”

Hilary Duff Recreates That Magically Awkward Disney Channel Promo — Watch!/n

Who said being a Disney Channel star was easy??
We're certain Hilary Duff has a few choice words for anyone who implies this, especially after dropping deets about THAT iconic promo filming sesh! You know, the one that went viral at the end of last year.
In case you forgot, unedited Disney Channel commercials were leaked in 2016 which featured Miz Duff and Raven-Symoné looking ready to murder some crew members. Let's just say the videos are magically awkward!
Related: Pretty Sure Scott Disick Just Sent Bella Thorne Flowers
Thankfully, the Lizzie McGuire star has since revealed why she and The View alum looked so miserable while filming the commercials. While promoting the new season of her show Younger, the mother-of-one dished to Buzzfeed: 

"It's so ridiculous. It's so funny though. So we had to do the thing and then they put it in CGI, the mouse ears. And then they made us do it like 900 times. And I think I like lost all personality at that point. Plus, I was, like, a pubescent teen — I was like, What are they making me do, this is invisible! But Raven-Symoné was nailing it!"
HIGHlarious! Apparently, despite doing the wand motion "900 times," the former Disney darling had no clue what she was doing as she continued:

"[I had been doing it] all day! I think I had shot the beginning of Lizzie McGuire with all those bouncy balls, and I was like, What is this-last minute thing? It's so good. It's, like, Hilary with a lot of attitude. Like, What are they making me do? But now I'm happy to do it, because that was hilarious."
AH-Mazing. But Lizzie *ahem* Hilary didn't stop at the confessional as she then recreated the promo — bless! Be sure to ch-ch-check Hilary's explanation and modern wand skills for yourself (below)!

Magic Johnson Entering 18th Day On $700,000-Per-Week Yacht! /nBALLLLLLLLLLLIN'!!!!! Magic Johnson has upgraded in a big way ... going from a $500k-per-week yacht to a $700k-per-week yacht -- and he's about to complete his 3RD WEEK on the floating mansion.  The NBA legend is currently floating around the Amalfi Coast with Sam Jackson on a boat called the Siren ... which is advertised at $680k-per-week during Summer high season.  It's 73 meters long -- has a movie theater, gym, dining room, hot tub, helicopter pad, an elevator ... and, of course, WiFi. Johnson and his family boarded the yacht on August 1 after touching down in a private jet.  Some of the family has left -- but Magic and Cookie Johnson are currently traveling with their good friends, The Jacksons.  In previous years, Magic rented out a cheaper yacht -- The Amadeus -- which used to run him about $527k per week.  Seems like he's enjoying the upgrade -- Friday morning, Magic took one of his jet skis out for a ride off the coast of Positano.  Magic just turned 58 on Monday -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY!/n
Megan Mullally Says There’s a ‘Very Good Chance’ ‘Will & Grace’ Will Get a Revival /n





                    REPORT: A New Season of ‘Will & Grace' Could Actually Be Happening 
                







According to Deadline, talks are underway to possibly bring back Will & Grace!

 MORE >>





In September, the cast of Will & Grace reunited for an election-themed mini-episode, which received six million views on YouTube and got everyone wondering, “Why isn’t a Will & Grace revival happening?” If you’re among the devoted who would love more time with the show’s lovable foursome, then you’re going to like what Megan Mullally said in a new interview!

“All I can say is that there is a very good chance that that might happen,” she told PrideSource when asked about revival rumors. “It’s not happening right this second. I mean, we’re not rehearsing or anything like that. But there is a very good chance that something is going to materialize.”
Mullally then pivoted to what could hypothetically happen, which is a magical frame of mind when considering the beloved show’s hopeful return.

“So speaking theoretically, in a completely made-up world where Will & Grace is coming back to NBC for ten episodes – just in that made-up world – it couldn’t be a better time,” she said.
In October, insiders began reporting that championing a reboot of the ‘90s sitcom began happening but at the time nearly all the details needed ironing out, with Deadline of the mind that the project would most like land at Netflix considering their track record with reinventing older shows.
During the interview, the 57-year-old actress also mentioned the soon-to-be inaugurated President of the United States when considering a revival’s comedic potential.
“I mean, it couldn’t possibly be better timing,” she continued. “I think more so now than even when we started! And who would have ever – I mean, it’s heinous that it’s because Donald Trump is the president-elect. That’s just a crazy sentence that nobody would have ever thought they’d utter. But having said that, at the same time, that just gives us carte blanche.”

Roger Federer’s Identical Twins (Both Pairs!) Cheer Him on to Record 8th Wimbledon Win/n

Roger Federer had a full support system looking on from the stands as he took home his eighth Wimbledon men’s singles championship on Sunday.
The Swiss tennis star, 35, defeated Marin Cilic in three straight sets,  6-3, 6-1, 6-4. The win gives Federer the record for the most men’s titles in the history of the event, edging out Pete Sampras and William Renshaw, who each won seven titles at Wimbledon.
“It’s disbelief that I can achieve such heights,” Federer said after his match, according to ESPN. “I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to be here, in another final.”

The concert will be held at the Old Trafford cricket ground just less than 10 weeks following the bombing at Manchester Arena. All net ticket proceeds will go to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund set up by Manchester City Council and the British Red Cross to aid the families and victims of the attack.
Fans who attended the original Grande show are being offered free tickets to the benefit concert, which they can obtain by registering on Ticketmaster by Wednesday (May 31, 2017).
“There is nothing I or anyone can do to take away the pain you are feeling or to make this better,” Grande wrote when she initially announced her plans to return to the city. “However, I extend my hand and heart and everything I possibly can give to you and yours, should you want or need my help in any way.”
She added, “We will not quit or operate in fear. We will not let this divide us. We won’t let hate win.”

Defense Says Another Serial Killer Linked to Two Attacks in Grim Sleeper Case/n
An attorney for the alleged Grim Sleeper serial killer suspect Lonnie Franklin Jr. filed a motion last week claiming that DNA evidence found at two attacks link another serial killer to the crimes.   
Franklin, a married father of two and former Los Angeles Police Department mechanic and sanitation worker for the city of Los Angeles, was charged in July 2010 with 10 murders and one attempted murder. He faces the death penalty for the alleged 23-year murder spree that began on Jan. 15, 1984, when Sharon Dismuke was discovered shot in the chest in the restroom of an abandoned gas station. Franklin was scheduled to go to trial Oct. 14 but it has been postponed again till Dec. 15.   
In the motion, Franklin’s defense claims convicted killer Chester Turner is linked through DNA evidence to the attacks on alleged Grim Sleeper victims Barbara Ware and Enietra Washington. Turner, a former pizza deliveryman and one of several serial killers who preyed on young, poor black women in South Los Angeles in the 80s and 90s, is on California’s Death Row for killing 14 women, including one who was pregnant.  Turner strangled his victims before he dumped their bodies mostly along freeways and alleys, within 20 blocks of his various homes and flophouses.  
“DNA analysis reveals that Chester Turner must be included as a potential biological donor to the DNA found,” the motion states.   
Franklin’s defense team also listed 19 other men as possible suspects in some of the attacks, including the boyfriend of one of the victims.   
“The evidence reveals a high probability that a third party, or parties, committed one or more of the charged offenses as well as were the actual killer and the only individual present during the crime that had the intent to kill,” the motion states.  
At a court hearing Friday, Los Angeles prosecutor Marguerite Rizzo questioned the defense expert’s methods of calculating the DNA evidence stating it defied “the correct methods of statistical analysis.”   
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy postponed Franklin’s trial so prosecutors could have their experts analyze the evidence. Kennedy criticized Franklin’s defense for handing prosecutors close to 2,000 pages of discovery days before the trial was set to start.   
“You know, you kind of put everybody in a box,” she said. “Because when you are turning material over, expert, scientific-type material in volume days before a scheduled trial that obviously require an expert’s review   it’s one thing to turn over a police report or an investigator’s report. It’s another thing to turn over scientific evidence at the last second I’m not going to force the prosecution to proceed unprepared.”   
Los Angeles prosecutor Beth Silverman told the judge that defense attorney Seymour Amster was “playing fast and loose and trying to ambush the people.”   
A hearing is scheduled on Oct. 20 where DNA experts are expected to testify.   
Most of Franklin’s alleged victims were shot with a .25-caliber pistol. Their bodies were discovered in Dumpsters and alleyways along Western Avenue in South Los Angeles.   
Ware, 23, was found dead in an alley Jan. 10, 1987. She was shot once in the chest. Washington told police that a man, driving an orange-colored Pinto, picked her up one night in Nov. 1988. The man shot her in the chest, then sexually assaulted her, and took a photo of her using a Polaroid camera, before pushing her out of his car. Police later found a photograph of Washington on Franklin’s garage floor after he was arrested.   
Franklin, a former corporal in the United States Army, was finally caught through familial DNA testing after his 28-year-old son, Christopher, was arrested for carrying a weapon in the summer of 2009 and had to give up a DNA swab. Once it was determined that Christopher was related to the killer, detectives followed the elder Franklin to a pizza place in Long Beach. As Franklin finished his meal, a detective who posed as a busboy collected a fork, two plastic cups, a plate and a pizza slice left by Franklin. A few days later, DNA taken from the pizza slice allegedly came back as a match to DNA found on Ware.   
In May, the LAPD announced they were trying to identify 35 women who may have been killed by Franklin.

It's just a bunch of Hocus Pocus, but we witches sure love it!On Saturday, Oct. 19, Hocus Pocus castmembers reunited 20 years after the film's 1993 release at an official Disney fan club meeting in Burbank., Calif. Among those in attendance: Thora Birch (Dani Dennison), Kathy Najimy (Mary of the Sanderson Sisters), Omri Katz (Max Dennison) and Vinessa Shaw (Allison, Max's crush).The two remaining Sanderson sisters—Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker—were not in attendance for the nostalgic get-together. Fans, however, made up for their absence by dressing in their likeness for the Hocus Pocus celebration. Props from the movie—including the Winifred Sanderson's spell book, bound by (not real!) human skin—were put on display.

Najimy was grateful that Hocus Pocus still has its spell cast on fans 20 years after its initial release. "halla to all the fabu people at the D23 screening and panel today," she tweeted. "we all had a blast! thanks for the kudos."Tubular!

This Is Why Chrissy Teigen Will Never Do It “Doggy Style” with John Legend Again/n

When it comes to sex, John Legend may be in the doghouse.

Chrissy Teigen got candid about what went on inside the bedroom in her cover story with Marie Claire. Though she has a healthy marriage with the “All of Me” crooner, the model admitted she had to think twice about doing it “doggy style” when she discovered an interesting fact about her husband.
“John and I had a double date, and we were joking around, and I go, ‘John’s never seen my butthole.’ And John says, ‘Are you kidding? Every time anyone does anything doggy style, you see a butthole. I see it every time.’ I was like, ‘We are never doing it doggy style again,” she shared.
However, the 31-year-old — who welcomed daughter Luna in April 2016 — is open to other positions though. After all, she does want to have more kids!
“I would definitely adopt or have foster children. But I loved being pregnant,” she admitted. “Maybe I should be scared [of having postpartum depression again], but I don’t know. It couldn’t be any worse than it was–could it?”

Earlier this year, Chrissy revealed she had been taking medication for postpartum depression since giving birth to her first child.
“I couldn’t figure out why I was so unhappy. I blamed it on being tired and possibly growing out of the role: ‘Maybe I’m just not a goofy person anymore. Maybe I’m just supposed to be a mom,'” she recalled in an essay in Glamour. “I started taking an antidepressant, which helped. And I started sharing the news with friends and family—I felt like everyone deserved an explanation, and I didn’t know how else to say it other than the only way I know: just saying it. It got easier and easier to say it aloud every time.”
She added, “I love John and Luna more than I can imagine loving anything, and John and I still hope to give Luna a few siblings. Postpartum hasn’t changed that.”

People Are Accusing Miley Cyrus Of Only Using Black Culture When It's 'Convenient'/n

Miley Cyrus is being called out.
As we reported, the 24-year-old announced her new music while opening up about entering the next chapter of her life in an interview with Billboard.
During the discussion, Milez talked about moving away from being in the hip hop scene and focusing more on her folksy roots.
Related: Haim's New Music Video Right Now Was Filmed In One Take!
For context, here is the 23 singer's full response when asked if Melanie Safka influenced her new sound: 
"She did, and I grew up with her. But I also love that new Kendrick [Lamar] song ["Humble"]: 'Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks.' I love that because it's not 'Come sit on my dick, suck on my cock.' I can't listen to that anymore. That's what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much 'Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock' — I am so not that … I was torn on whether I was going to work with certain producers that I really like. But I feel if we're not on the same page ­politically … My record is political, but the sound bite doesn't stop there. Because you can write something beautiful and you know E! News will ruin our lives and say, 'This is a political record.' Because then I'm the Dixie Chicks and I'm getting my album smashed in the streets, and that's not what I want. I want to talk to people in a compassionate, understanding way — which people aren't doing."
We totally understand Miz Cyrus' interest in wanting to create music with more substance… but people are NOT happy that she used black culture only when it was "convenient" for her.
Ch-ch-check out the responses arguing that the former child star is guilty of cultural appropriation (below)!

'Vanderpump Rules' Star Stassi Schroeder Is Dumped By Boyfriend/n
Vanderpump Rules star Stassi Schroeder has revealed boyfriend Patrick Meagher dumped her after their four-year anniversary of togetherness.
Just one day after Schroeder had posted an Instagram tribute to Meagher for their anniversary, Schroeder stunned fans on social media by revealing their split. Schroeder was crying on Instagram and wrote that she’d even planned a special anniversary vacation to Mexico for the two of them. But it wasn’t to be.

She disclosed on Twitter, with a photo reference to Sex and the City: The Movie, in which the character Carrie Bradshaw attacked her boyfriend Mr. Big for rejecting their wedding, “Broken up with on our anniversary after I planned a trip for us to Mexico. Call me Carrie Bradshaw.”

Schroeder also wrote to her friend, comedian Rachael O’Brien, “Currently…. @rachaelnobrien, will you accompany me to Mexico, close the shades & feed me oatmeal on the trip I planned.” All had seemed fine for Schroeder on Friday, when she posted a photo of herself with Meagher, captioning it, “I met this gangster 4 years ago. And we’ve been together consistently without one disagreement ever…”
But Schroeder was being sarcastic as she and Meagher have broken up before. And in fact, as Radar has reported, she has previously said, “We fight all the time.”
And this weekend, she told followers it was over for them again. Schroeder had briefly quit Vanderpump Rules to make their relationship work, moving from Los Angeles to New York to be with Meagher during season 3. But they split up and she returned to the Bravo show for season 4.

Schroeder and Meagher, a radio host, reconciled this May, however, as Radar reported.
Schroeder’s life has included plenty of scandals and feuds with co-stars and the drama continues as her on-again, off-again relationship with Meagher is kaput again!

Amy Schumer Uses Topless Photo to Clear Up Rumors About Netflix Salary Negotiations/n
Show me the money? Amy Schumer will show you more than that.This week, Variety reported that in 2016, Schumer was paid about $11 million to star in a comedy special for Netflix, which premiered this past March, and that after it was reported that Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle had each landed $20 million deals for their own stand-up specials, the actress and comedienne's team asked Netflix for more money for her. The outlet quoted a source as saying that Schumer then "received significantly more compensation after she raised the question of fairness relative to the Rock and Chappelle deals." The male comics and Netflix have not commented.Following the report, many people took to Twitter to let Schumer know exactly what they thought.

"Hot dog dog," Schumer wrote on Instagram Wednesday, alongside a photo of her standing topless in a kitchen while holding a dog wearing a hot dog costume to her naked chest. "Thanks for chiming in on what you feel I deserve to be paid. I believe women deserve equal pay. However I don't believe I deserve equal pay to Chris and Dave. They are legends and 2 of the greatest comics of all time.""I would like to say that I have been selling out arenas these last couple years," she continued. "Something a female comic has never done. That's a big deal to me, especially because I know I do my best every night on stage for the audience and they have a good time. I didn't ask for the same as my friends. I did ask for more than the initial offer. I will continue to work my ass off and be the best performer I can be. The reports of me 'demanding' or 'insisting' on equal pay to them aren't a true. #fat #stealsjokes."

Last month, Forbes reported that Schumer is No. 5 on its annual list of highest-paid comedians, with an estimated annual income of $37.5 million, trailing behind Chappelle ($47 million), Louis C.K. ($52 million), Rock ($57 million) and Jerry Seinfeld ($69 million). She is the first woman to make the list, for the second consecutive year.

Britney Spears recently used her bodyguard's credit card to purchase a couple of pairs of boots.  Apparently her conservatorship has a budget limit, and when Britney walked into the Steve Madden store, I guess she'd already reached that limit.  So Britney paid with her bodyguard's credit card, then the really-on-top-of-it cashier gave her some grief when she signed her own name. I don't know why the red flag wasn't that Britney Spears' real name is most likely Britney Spears and not Leroy Johnson, but good for the cashier.  I'm more concerned about the fact that Britney Spears is being protected by a man that she's able to pick pocket.

Broadway just can't get enough of NeNe Leakes. The Real Housewives of Atlanta alum will return to the Big Apple just a year after making her stage debut in Cinderella, this time as the infamous Matron "Mama" Morton in the Tony-winning revival of Chicago. Leakes is the latest major name to join the celeb-friendly production. Rumer Willis is currently nearing the end of her run as star murder defendant Roxie Hart and will take her final bow on Nov. 1.NeNe will take center stage starting Nov. 23. The sassy star celebrated the great news on Twitter, writing, "I'm so excited to say I am headed back to BROADWAY in CHICAGO as Matron Mama Morton #neneismama."There's no doubt Leakes, 47, will bring down the house as the sexy, power-flaunting matriarch of the Cook County Jail, a role that scored Queen Latifah a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for the 2002 film adaptation (co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones won for her role as jailhouse vixen Velma Kelly). Check out the top seven reasons Leakes will absolutely dominate below:

1. NeNe has major experience on the dance floor: Though Leakes admitted she was, "totally out of [her] comfort zone" on Season 18 of Dancing With the Stars, her seven weeks on the reality competition show were full of highlights. We're betting she breaks out some of the killer moves partner Tony Dovolani taught her for "When You're Good to Mama."

2. She's witnessed her fair share of drama: For Chicago, NeNe has to keep a sharp eye on the wild antics of her inmate charges. Not to worry, though, since drama almost always followed Leakes on RHOA, making this celeb one tough cookie that won't go down without a fight. 

3. Playing a villain is her forte:"Mama" is known for presiding over the cell block with a corrupt "I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine" attitude, and Leakes has a little experience in the master-manipulator department. In Cinderella, Leakes played the evil stepmother, and for Glee she played a rival cheer coach and arch nemesis to Sue Sylvester.

4. She keeps it real: When it comes to NeNe, she always wears any and every emotion on her sleeve. Broadway attendees can surely expect to see some Tony-worthy emoting in Chicago.

5. Friends and family support her:Where would a successful Broadway star be without a few built-in fans in the audience?! Just prior to reporting to prison, BFF Teresa Giudice took her daughters to see NeNe in Cinderella and it's safe to predict that hubby Gregg Leakes will be there on opening night—hopefully with a few dozen roses for his leading lady. We can hear the "bravos" now...What do you think of Chicago's latest casting coup? Sound off in the comments!

Helen Mirren Dismisses Ivanka Trump as Out-of-Touch Fluff, Hopes Melania Will Take President Down/n
Dame Helen Mirren has never been one to bite her tongue.
The 72-year-old Oscar-winning actress gave her thoughts on First Lady Melania Trump and Donald‘s right-hand woman Ivanka in a new interview for the August issue of Allure — and, naturally, didn’t hold back.
“[Ivanka] talks a good game, but there’s no substance,” Mirren said. “Her book [Women Who Work] is so ignorant about how the majority of women live, talking about ‘Make time for yourself to have a massage.’ Puh-lease.”
As for Ivanka’s father, Mirren says Donald is “less of an extremist than he lets on.”
“[Donald] just said and did what ever it took to get what he desired,” Mirren said. “That is quite terrifying, because it means there’s a lack of morality there and a lack of conscientiousness.”
Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Assault

The president’s administration has been marred by scandal, firings, resignations and low approval ratings. But, according to Mirren, if there’s anyone who can stop the embattled leader, it’s Melania.
“You look at old Mel there, and she is one of the most powerful women in the world because she could take him down. She almost did that with the hand,” the actress said, referring to a May incident in which the First Lady swatted her husband’s hand away as they landed in Israel.
“I’m Eastern European, you know; [we’ve] got these dark souls. That dark Slovenian soul is about to come out.”

 Look Ma, No Plugs! Red Hot Chili Peppers Implicated In Super Bowl Charade -- They Weren't.../n
Remember when “live” music controversies were limited to pop stars like Beyoncé and Mariah Carey?
Now, rock legends the Red Hot Chili Peppers are under the scope of less-than-earnest stage work, as many reports indicate that the band members didn’t have their guitars plugged (or wireless packs) in during Sunday’s Super Bowl halftime show with Bruno Mars.
The controversy unfurled when a pair of noted musicians, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, and Joe Bonamassa, sent separate tweets picking up on the abnormalities in the widely-viewed performance.

Reid wrote, “That guitar is plugged into NOTHING,” while Bonamassa wrote, “Flea… I mean we all know, but for god’s sake at least try to humor the children.”

Reid added that in a high-profile televised event as such, organizers “leave NOTHING to chance,” even though they “actually DON’T want Blatantly Fake made obvious.” /n

Bravo Feud! Lisa Vanderpump SLAMS ‘Homophobic’ 'RHOC' Housewife Peggy Sulahian/n
The Real Housewives of Orange County star Peggy Sulahian is making some very powerful enemies.
Last week, Radar exclusively revealed that the 43-year-old newbie banned her own brother, celeb fashion designer Pol’ Atteu, from attending their father’s funeral due to his homosexuality. Atteu said that he was still “heartbroken” over the incident, while his longtime fiance Patrik Simpson accused Sulahian of being “homophobic.”
Veteran Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Vanderpump – who boasts she is a “huge advocate for the LGBTQ community” — told RadarOnline.com exclusively that she thinks Sulahian’s behavior is absolutely “disgusting!”
PHOTOS: Peek Inside Lisa Vanderpump’s Beverly Glen Estate
“I do not tolerate prejudice of any kind,” Vanderpump, 56, said. “And I have no interest in homophobia or in disgusting behavior like this. I do not condone or even acknowledge it.”
“You know my opinion on this. Any attack on the gay community is something that I take very personally.”
As Radar previously reported, Sulahian – who described herself in the first few episodes of RHOC as coming from a “very tight-knit Armenian family” – has not spoken to her brother, Atteu, for over twenty years.
According to Simpson, she even went so far as to say that “Pol’s kind” was not welcome around her family.

Although Sulahian’s co-stars Vicki Gunvalson, 55, and Kelly Dodd, 43, have not spoken out in support of Atteu and Simpson, the two ladies are furious with their costar.
“Vicki feels betrayed a bit because she befriended Peggy. She not going to treat her the same after this. Vicki has zero tolerance for anti-gay actions, and she does not want Peggy on the cast if this is who she truly is,” a source said.

Schwarzenegger's Baby Mama Get Paid for Magazine Tell-All? She may be the mother of Arnold Schwarzenegger's illegitimate child. But don't think for a second Mildred Baena is whoring herself out to make a quick buck. Really. Th.../n
She may be the mother of Arnold Schwarzenegger's illegitimate child. But don't think for a second Mildred Baena is whoring herself out to make a quick buck. Really.The Sperminator's longtime housekeeper/mistress is addressing reports that Hello! magazine paid her for her highly sought-after first sit-down.Here's what Team Mildred is saying:

"She gave the interview in order to set the record straight once and for all," attorney Michael J. Salz tells E! News. "Mildred was tired of people selling their lies to the media or claiming to speak for her when they do not."OK, so he didn't exactly come out and say she wasn't raking in the dough (it's what's called in the obfuscation biz a "nondenial denial").As for how the interview was conducted, Salz says: "We did not personally pre-approve the questions or place limitations on the topics to be covered; Mildred talked about those areas that she was willing to discuss and kept private those that she was not. All she wanted to do was put the lies and rumors to rest. And we believe that she has done that through this interview."Glad he cleared that up.TMZ separately reported that the interview for Hello! was conducted by a freelance reporter who's a close associate of Salz.In the interview, Baena discussed her longterm relationship with Schwarzenegger, how she informed her son of his DNA donor and her confession to Maria Shriver about her boy's biological daddy.As for Baena's financial situation, she's since retired from her former position in the Schwarzenegger household (and what a position that was!) and living in a comfortable home in Bakersfield, Calif., reportedly paid for by Schwarzenegger.Speaking of whom, there's been no imediate comment from either Schwarzenegger or Shriver on Baena's revelations.

DeMario Vindicated! No Sexual Assault In 'BIP' Pool Incident/n
The investigation of Bachelor in Paradise‘s now-infamous pool incident in Mexico is complete — with no findings of sexual assault!
As Radar previously reported, the scandal kicked off last Sunday when Warner Bros. released a statement explaining that the network had “suspended production” to conduct a thorough investigation of sexual assault allegations.
Insiders told Entertainment Tonight that contestant DeMario Jackson got hot and heavy with an allegedly intoxicated Corinne Olympios while relaxing in a pool on set.

Jackson publicly defended himself against allegations last Thursday, saying: “My character has been assassinated. My family name has been drug through the mud.”
The reality star also revealed that he was also fired from his executive recruiter position thanks to the scandal.
“I don’t blame anyone right now, all I want [are] the tapes,” he said.

According to reports, Jackson’s attorney met with Warner Bros. lawyers on Monday to review tapes of the incident. He was ultimately cleared of assault allegations.
Meanwhile, filming is set to resume in Mexico and will air later this summer, according to a statement from WB obtained by BuzzFeed.
“The tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member,” the statement read. “Nor does the tape show. . .that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy.”
PHOTOS: Inside Bachelor Ben’s Bachelor Pad 
“Production on this season of the Bachelor in Paradise will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show’s policies and procedures to enhance and further the safety and security of all participants.”
The network also insisted the swimming pool incident will not be released.
Olympios, who previously claimed she suffered “physical and emotional trauma” that evening, has yet to speak out on the matter.

There’s another twist in this perplexing mystery…

According to The Wrap, the lawyer representing Steven Avery filed a motion today (Aug. 26, 2016) demanding physical evidence from the investigation following the murder of Teresa Halbach so that it can be tested in ways that were not possible in 2005.
Avery was the subject of the docuseries Making a Murderer, which explored his conviction in 1985 for rape and attempted murder. He was exonerated 18 years later by DNA evidence only to be convicted of Halbach’s murder under murky and troubling circumstances.
Kathleen Zellner, Avery’s lawyer states in the filing that, “Mr. Avery has already completed a series of tests that will conclusively establish his innocence.”

The statement goes on to explain that she has another possible suspect for the highly-publicized murder who she plans to reveal after the aforementioned tests.
The case hinges largely on the argument that Avery was framed for the 2005 murder by the Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Department.
In the filing, Avery requests radiocarbon testing, “which could definitely establish the age of Mr. Avery’s blood found in the victim’s vehicle and determine, based on the age, if the blood was planted.”

The 25-year-old daughter of Sarah Palin became a single mother to two after giving birth to her daughter on Wednesday, December 23, 2015.
“My sweet Sailor Grace was born yesterday, our family couldn’t be more complete,” she wrote on her Instagram page, sharing a picture from the hospital showing her cuddling the newborn.

RadarOnline.com broke the news that Palin was expecting her second child, which she then admitted was a “disappointment,” since she was only engaged to Dakota Meyer.
The pair ended up calling off their engagement after Radar revealed that he had previously been married.
Meyer bragged on his Facebook page just days before Palin gave birth, posting a meme that said: “I know what I bring to the table. Trust me when I say I’m not afraid to eat alone.”
He also deleted all the pictures of Palin from his page.
While neither Palin nor Meyer ever confirmed the news, a source told Radar that she told friends he is indeed the father.
His social media pages mentioned nothing of the birth of the baby.
Palin already has a son, Tripp, with Levi Johnston, but the two broke off their 2008 engagement and have been locked in a vicious child support battle ever since his birth.
She also shared a picture of her two children together and wrote “My heart just doubled.”

‘Out Of Control’ Miley Cyrus Had Dad Billy Ray Begging Her To Go To Rehab/n
A new series is set to expose just how far Miley Cyrus had fallen from her wholesome Hannah Montana roots — and the shocking way her family found out with one photo inside her home.
“The picture in the pages of the Enquirer served as a start and a distinct warning to those around Miley Cyrus that she seemingly hit rock bottom,” said Dylan Howard, editor in chief of the National Enquirer.
The intimate snapshot, taken by a worried friend, showed Cyrus working on her music late one night at home, surrounded by what appeared to be marijuana and drug paraphernalia. The photo was the latest warning sign — on top of her x-rated videos and her ever-changing sexual identity claims — that sent her loved ones into a panic about the former Disney star.

According to what insiders said, her father Billy Ray Cyrus and her godmother Dolly Parton were already planning an intervention.
“Billy Ray and Dolly were desperate to get her to seek help, to go to rehab and clean up her act,” noted James Robertson, associate editor of the National Enquirer.
But will Miley crash and burn like so many other child stars before her, or has she found herself despite the harsh spotlight?
Watch the sneak peek clip above!

You'll Never Believe How Much Pope Francis' iPad Sold for at This Charity Auction It's no secret that Pope Francis is a fan of the Internet—in fact, he regularly tweets from the official @Pontifex account.  So, it should come .../n
It's no secret that Pope Francis is a fan of the Internet—in fact, he regularly tweets from the official @Pontifex account. So, it should come as no surprise that the native Argentine was also a proud iPad owner prior to auctioning off his tablet at a recent charity event (perhaps he was due for an upgrade?). Per NBC News, the iPad previously belonging to the 78-year-old religious figure sold for a whopping $30,500 at an auction on Tuesday in Uruguay. The report also states that proceeds from the sale were donated to a school for the poor in Uruguay. The iPad was inscribed with the text, "His Holiness Francisco. Servizio Internet Vatican, March 2013," and also includes a certificate signed by Fabian Pedacchio Leaniz, the pope's personal secretary.

Local auction house Castells sold the iPad, and in spite of the high price point, NBC reports that there were number of failed attempts at auctioning off the Apple device through houses Christie's and Sotheby's.And while Castells opted to keep the identity of the buyer private, Uruguayan priest Gonzalo Aemilius donated the tablet to Francisco de Paysandu high school. "May you do something good with it," Aemilius recalled being told by the pope, upon being presented with the papal iPad.

As RadarOnline.com previously reported Cryer is requesting that his current payment of $8,000 per month be reduced to zero, with the argument that hehas temporary custody of their son, Charley, so Trigger should be entitled to nothing.

 Not Soon Enough! Phaedra Parks Couldn’t Wait For Husband Apollo Nida To Report To Prison.../n
Phaedra Parks’ drama with her prison-bound husband Apollo Nida has been a key storyline all season on The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and Sunday night’s episode was no exception, as viewers learned Parks was actually anxious for Nida to be put behind bars as soon as possible.
As RadarOnline.com readers know, Nida is currently in prison serving an eight-year sentence for his bank fraud and identity theft conviction, and Sunday’s show gave viewers a glimpse of the events prior to Nida entering custody.
Parks admitted to her mother Pastor Regina that she would be less stressed out when Nida was incarcerated.
PHOTOS: Top Earning Real Housewives
“I won’t have to be worried about all his nonsense, wondering what’s going on with him, has he wrecked something, has he got in trouble somewhere?” she explained.
A week after fans saw Nida telling Parks at a nightclub that he still loved her even if she didn’t love him, the housewife told the cameras, “Apollo’s running around town like a chicken with his head cut off. I never know where he is, but no matter where I am in the world, he seems to pop up.”
Parks told her mother, “It’s easy to say you love somebody,” but Nida’s actions didn’t show it.

Also, when they did talk, he was always trying to blame her for everything that had happened.
Parks said if Nida was insecure, he shouldn’t have married a successful woman.
Plus, the attorney and licensed mortician said there was no reason for Nida to have broken the law: “I have given him many legitimate business ideas, from the family funeral business to the workout DVDs.
Watch the video on RadarOnline.com

“He’s clearly rejected most of them and has just done whatever he wanted to do.”
And Parks claimed that their sons Ayden, 4, and Dylan, 19 months, seemed to be the furthest thing from his mind as he waited to find out when and where he would serve his sentence.
Later in the episode, Parks was seen caring for the kids and sighing, “I don’t know where Apollo is.”

She vowed that once he left for prison, that “nothing will change. I will continue to be a strong role model.
“I want to make sure they are thriving young men.”
Then in a heartbreaking moment, adorable Ayden said in his nightly prayer, “Bless mommy and daddy.”

Also on the episode, NeNe Leakes called a pow-wow so that she, frenemy Cynthia Bailey, and feuding divas Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams might bury the hatchet.
“Hi, Porsha, are we speaking today?” laughed Moore, who was physically attacked by Williams at the last reunion show.
“The four of us have had our issues,” Leakes said in the understatement of the season.

Leakes reiterated that she loved Bailey after the two had earlier started the painful process of repairing their friendship, and Bailey returned the sentiment.
Bailey pointed out that both of them got their feelings hurt, but said she always wanted to be friends with Leakes.
“I need time,” Leakes said.
Moore suggested the two just have lunch together, but Leakes said not for a couple of years, which startled Bailey.

“Just know that I am not your enemy,” Bailey told Leakes, then kissed her on the cheek three times.
Then Bailey said Williams was rude when she was an hour late for their previous lunch.
Williams started to shout at Bailey — and when Moore tried to butt in, Williams called Moore, “rude as a mother*cker”.

Finally, Williams and Moore also made up.
Moore said, “There were a lot of things said and done … I gotta forgive and I have.”
Williams replied, “I acknowledged everything that happened.”

Moore got up and offered Williams a hug and even owned up to her own abrasive antics at the reunion show.
“I take full responsibility: can you give me a hug?” Moore said.
The two embraced and Moore suggested, “Let’s wipe the slate clean.”

RHOA fans also saw Kandi Burruss and her Mama Joyce discuss how Todd Tucker’s mom Sharon Wells had threatened to punch Mama Joyce.
And as Radar has reported, rampaging mother-in-law Wells (who tragically died after filming her housewives’ scenes this year) had also considered slapping Mama Joyce with a lawsuit.
Burruss recalled how angry Wells was about Mama Joyce calling her a prostitute (a charge Wells vehemently denied).

But Burruss’ mother, who had just moved into a new home financed by Kandi, still refused to apologize to her in-law.
Later, when Burruss told husband Tucker, he proposed that the two of them take separate holidays so he could be with his mom.
In Tucker’s opinion, their two mothers couldn’t be in the same room together, and he said to Burruss, “It’s all a problem your mother created. I don’t see it working.”

Also, RHOA revealed more about newbie Claudia Jordan’s life as she visited with her Italian mother Teresa and African-American grandmother Lillian.
Jordan, 41, said in confessional that her parents got divorced when she was 10-years-old.
Her mother urged her to have a baby out of wedlock because she wanted a grandchild.
Jordan reminded her mother they’d never said I love you.
“I show my love by doing things,” Teresa said.
She sighed that Jordan’s father would profess his love but “soon he saw a different skirt he went after.” /n
R. Kelly's Virginia Concert Has Tons of Seats Available Amid 'Cult' Allegations/nThere's a good reason R. Kelly went on camera to reassure fans his weekend concerts are still a go -- because ticket sales for his opening night are seriously lagging. Kelly's first concert since the sex 'cult' allegations came out is Friday night at Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater in Virginia Beach. We checked Live Nation's website to see what tickets are still available. In a word: PLENTY!!!  The venue -- which holds 20,000 -- appears barely at 50% capacity with just hours to go. We talked to someone at the amphitheater and we're told it could be as simple as this -- Kelly just ain't popular anymore. Of course, it could also be a reaction to allegations made by Joycelyn Savage's family. As we reported, Kelly recorded an on-camera denial ... dismissing the rumors as  "all crap. " Kinda like his Friday night box office numbers./n

On another subject ... he also strongly disagrees with Floyd on the matter of sex before big fights./n
'Macho Man' Randy Savage -- Makes WWE Hall of Fame ... Announcement Expected Tonight/nOooooh yeaaah ...  "Macho Man " Randy Savage is FINALLY going to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame ... TMZ Sports has learned. Sources tell us ... the WWE is expected to make the official announcement on  "Raw " tonight. It's unclear why the WWE has waited so long to enshrine Savage, who passed away in 2011 -- especially since he's one of the most famous wrestlers of all time.  In fact, Stone Cold Steve Austin even confronted Vince McMahon about it last month -- with Vince promising Savage would be inducted in the near future. Now, McMahon is proving he's a man of his word -- we're told the official induction ceremony will go down in Santa Clara, CA the day before WrestleMania 31.The cream rises to the top. /n
Tom Cruise Tried, Failed 'Mission Impossible' Building Stunt at Least Twice/nTom Cruise's injuries on the set of  "Mission Impossible 6 " might be more severe than previously thought ... 'cause he tried and failed his building stunt jump at least twice. TMZ has obtained a second video showing Tom Sunday attempting to clear a building with one giant hop during filming for  "MI:6 " ... and like the first clip, he fails here too -- this time perhaps more miserably. The hit against the side of the building sounds crushing -- and considering he tried this at least twice -- it raises questions as to how seriously he's hurt ... and whether this might affect the rest of production.  We've placed a call in to Tom's reps and Paramount Pictures ... so far no word back. /n

The pair’s “very fragile” custody arrangement is about to implode, RadarOnline.com has learned, as the actor is demanding more time with his beloved boy.

Teresa Giudice Calls Jacqueline Laurita A 'F*cking Crazy B*tch' As Husband Chris Continues Fraud Drama At RHONJ Reunion!/n

Reunited and it feels so… f*cking crazy.
Teresa Giudice made the difficult decision to return to Real Housewives of New Jersey this year despite spending 11 months behind bars for fraud — and we're happy to say she survived the season… so far!
Sunday night marked Part 2 of the Season 7 reunion, and while Joe Giudice wasn't there to defend himself — he's currently on month nine of his own 41-month sentence — Andy Cohen invited the other House Husbands onto the show to get their sides of the story.

Unfortunately for Tre, that meant facing both Jacqueline Laurita AND Chris Laurita — two against one!
We already saw Teresa throw Jac and Caroline Manzo under the bus for alerting the feds to her husband's illegal dealings… but Chris made some serious allegations of his own against Joe during his moment in the spotlight.
It's just too bad for him that wasn't about to keep Teresa from calling his wife a "f*cking crazy b*tch" — with rabies, no less! LOLz!!
Sorry, Jac… Teresa will always be the star of the show.

'Time Is Running Out!' DC Investigator Sues Cops For Files On Seth Rich/n
The culprits behind Democrat operative Seth Rich’s murder WILL be revealed! That’s the vow of investigator Jack Burkman, who held a press conference today announcing he is suing the DC Metropolitan Police Department in order to obtain “crucial material” regarding the case, Radaronline.com has exclusively learned.
“The release of this crucial material will help bring peace to the victim’s family, and it will help to either confirm or refute the various theories that swirl about this important murder case,” Burkman said in the lawsuit.
During the press conference, Burkman questioned the MPD’s decision to withhold information about the investigation from the public.
PHOTOS: Hostile Takeover! ’19 Kids And Counting’ Star Jill Duggar’s Facebook Account Hacked By Raunchy Pranksters — 12 Hilarious Posts
“We don’t want to make allegations, but why would the police department not want us to see the medical examiner’s report and the ballistics report? That’s bizarre.” Burkman asked.
“The real tragedy of this, is time is running out. We’ve learned for instance that [Seth’s] Twitter account was deleted. We don’t know how. Certain emails are being deleted. Evidence is being destroyed day by day. Time is running out, and these people are withholding information. We need that,” Burkman continued.
“In a case of this profile, when you don’t have information released since Halloween of last year, its a pretty safe assumption that this is a cold case,” he said.

The Rich family hired Rod Wheeler — a Washington-based private investigator — who had indicated that there was tangible evidence that Rich had communicated with WikiLeaks prior to his death. The following day, Wheeler backtracked on those claims, and local authorities said that his assertions were “unfounded.” The family later expressed regret over hiring Wheeler, according to the New York Times.
Rich’s family have been the toughest critics of claims their son was involved in Wikileaks.
“As we’ve seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by press,” a statement released by the family said.

Rich was a DNC employee who was set to work on the Hillary Clinton campaign when he was fatally and mysteriously shot a block away from his Bloomingdale, DC home in July of last year.
“There had been a struggle. His hands were bruised, his knees are bruised, his face is bruised, and yet he had two shots to his back, and yet they never took anything… They didn’t finish robbing him, they just took his life,” Rich’s mother said in a statement to NBC’s Washington Affiliate following her son’s murder.
Burkman has offered up to $150,000 for any information leading to the murder.
Rich was 27 years old.

This isn't your mother's Psycho.A&E has just released a new trailer for its upcoming drama Bates Motel, a prequel to the classic Alfred Hitchcock film, and it looks downright killer. Seriously. Check out that dead body being dumped in a lake.Executive produced by Emmy-winner Carlton Cuse and Friday Night Lights' Kerry Ehrin, the series finds troubled teen Norman Bates (British actor Freddie Highmore) and his very-much-alive mother Norma Louise (Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga) taking over the infamous inn after moving to a Northern California coastal town where nothing is as it seems. "This town looks really beautiful on the outside," Cuse says in the clip, "but underneath it is something very dark and malevolent." Would you expect anything less from the guy who helped shepherd Lost? 

Nester Carbonell, who played ageless-wonder Richard Alpert on the ABC hit drama, knew he was in for a bloody-good ride when he agreed to reunite with Cuse for Bates Motel. "When I knew Carlton was doing it, I knew it was gonna be sensational," the actor, who plays a suspicious town sheriff in the cable drama, recently told us. "He sent me the first six scripts, and I was blown away."Expect the series to shed light on the twisted upbringing that eventually led Norman to become a cross-dressing, butcher-knife-wielding serial killer. The Oedipal dynamic between Mother and son is evident in the trailer, which shows Norma stripping down to black lingerie in front of her kid and Norman catching a glimpse of his mother's sexy silhouette in the window of the iconic Psycho house. (As we previously reported, the Bates patriarch dies under mysterious circumstances at the beginning of the pilot.)"It's certainly not a replica of the film in any way," Carbonell told us of the series. "It's really a re-imagining because it's in present-day times. The motel, and some of the issues, are the same but the world they live in is radically different."

And…LOL-worthy? "There's a lot of humor," insists the actor. "A lot of guilting of the son, which is very funny. Obviously, it's dark humor, but I find it very funny."Check out the trailer, which includes commentary from both producers and cast, including hot up-and-comer Max Thieriot, who plays Norman's rebellious older brother, Dylan.Bates Motel premieres its 10-episode first season in March.

A universal pop song and the universe are about to align.
Guests aboard the Royal Caribbean’s Total Eclipse Cruise have an extra surprise in store for their once-in-a-lifetime viewing experience: Bonnie Tyler, the Welsh songstress of “Total Eclipse of the Heart” fame, will be on board to perform her 1983 hit just as the moon sails across the sun. (The cruise ship will be positioned in the path of totality for this critical moment. “Bonnie Tyler was a natural choice for this once-in-a-lifetime moment,” said the president and CEO of Royal Caribbean International, Michael Bayley.)
Tyler’s song launched her to stardom and remains a classic today, especially as a karaoke favorite. But this is the first time she’ll be performing it during this highly anticipated astronomical event.
“It’s going to be so exciting,” Tyler told TIME, speaking from a brief stopover in Wales. “It doesn’t happen very often, does it?”

Tyler is a special guest on the Oasis of the Seas for a few days of the week-long cruise, which departs from Orlando, Fla. for the Caribbean on Aug. 20. Her performance will be backed by the pop-rock band DNCE, helmed by Joe Jonas and best known for their 2015 hit “Cake By the Ocean.” Tyler, meanwhile, has carried on a multi-decade career that has taken her around the world; she’s recently been on tour in New Zealand, eastern Europe and South America.
Don’t worry about her getting seasick while on board the Oasis of the Seas or being thrown off by the eclipse. “I have a ship of my own,” she told TIME. “I go with the flow, darling. I’m not worried about things like that.”
To prepare, Tyler and DNCE will rehearse for the day prior. Tyler also always works with her voice coach on vocal exercises to prep for a show. “So if anybody hears strange noises coming from my cabin while aboard ship, they’ll know what it is,” she warned.
“The eclipse of the sun lasts 2 minutes and 40 minutes, I’m told,” Tyler elaborated. “Unlike my song. It had to be chopped about, because it was so long. I never thought it would be played on the radio, in the beginning.”

In fact, “Total Eclipse of the Heart” almost never happened at all. After finding success in the U.S. with 1978 ballad “It’s a Heartache,” Tyler sought to change tacks and work with the songwriter behind Meat Loaf, Jim Steinman.
“The A&R guy said, ‘Are you crazy? He’s never going to work with you.’ And I said, ‘Well, ask him!’ You don’t get until you ask,” Tyler recalled. “So they asked him, and… I went over to meet him, and within three weeks he’d finished writing the song for me, ‘Total Eclipse of the Heart,’ that he’d started writing many years ago. And he finished it off and gave it to me to sing. I wouldn’t have had this hit record without bloody asking. And I got it.”
Upon first hearing the track, Tyler had a strong emotional response. “It made me cry, because I loved it so much,” she remembers. She was right to believe in the song: the original hit was one of the decade’s best-selling records with six million copies sold, and was nominated for multiple Grammys in 1984. That year, Tyler lost out to Michael Jackson and Irene Cara, for “Flashdance—What a Feeling.” “Now, I don’t mind losing out to Michael Jackson, I’ll tell you that much,” she said with a laugh.

But over the years, it’s remained popular as an enduring karaoke favorite. “God knows why, because it’s not an easy song to sing. But it’s a beautiful song,” Tyler added. “It’s a massive song, an evergreen song that you hear on the radio all the time, whether it’s an eclipse or not. And you know, you can bet your life on all these talent shows — X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent — [it] pops up so often with the contestants.”
It also spikes in popularity right around eclipses. Spotify tracked a 75 percent increase in streams the day after last year’s March total solar eclipse, and YouTube views for the music video are already growing in anticipation of August’s event, putting her at more than 300 million and counting. The music video, filmed over the course of two days in the Holloway Sanatorium outside London, is also a cult classic for its otherworldly themes and non-sequitur scenes. “It was snowing on the ground, and I had to run barefoot,” Tyler remembered of making the clip.
The Total Eclipse Cruise experience will be more straightforward for viewers — although certainly unique in its own way.
While the cruise will continue on to visit islands in the Caribbean, Tyler will be ducking out to continue touring. Her most recent album, a Nashville-recorded collection is called Rocks and Honey.

As Henrietta Lacks lay dying in the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1951, doctors sliced off a bit of her cancerous tumor — without asking — and before long her robust cells, flourishing in petri dishes, helped lead to the discovery of the polio vaccine, in vitro fertilization, and gene mapping. Now the tale, unspooled by Rebecca Skloot in her 2010 best-seller, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, has become an HBO biopic starring Oprah Winfrey as Lacks’ daughter, Deborah.
“The book connects the epic with the intimate, and that’s the movie’s ambition,” says George C. Wolfe, who adapted and directed it. “This woman’s cells helped heal the planet, yet her children were suffering. They didn’t know their mother’s story, even though they were living in the shadows of Johns Hopkins. I found that dichotomy incredibly moving.”

Wolfe says the book’s science could be daunting (“I kept reducing it further and further down”), but what intrigued him most was how Lacks’ daughter processed it: “I’m interested in how people create their own mythologies so they can continue to live.”

 Crash Victim's Family Blasts 'Melrose Place' Star For Dirty Delays In Deadly DUI Lawsuit.../n
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned family of the woman that Amy Locane killed in a 2010 drunk driving accident in Montgomery Township, New Jersey, are accusing the Melrose Place star of dirty legal tactics to drag out the case and drain their resources — and they’re making a desperate bid to finally put an end to their ongoing civil lawsuit.
READ THE COURT DOCUMENTS HERE
As Radar reported, Locane had a blood-alcohol content nearly three times the legal limit of .08 at the time of the 2010 accident that tragically took the life of 60-year-old art dealer Helene Seeman.
At Locane’s 2012 manslaughter trial, Seeman’s husband, Fred, testified that the impact of the actress’ speeding Chevrolet Tahoe hitting their sedan felt like “you were hit by a bomb.”
Locane, 45, was facing decades behind bars for manslaughter in the case, but the judge ended up sentencing her to just three years in prison.
The judge noted his shocking decision was based on the fact that the actress is a mother of two children, one of which suffers a disability.

The actress went on to serve a paltry two and a half years in prison before she was released on parole back in 2015.
The state appealed the judge’s sentence, claiming it was too lenient, and an appeals court ruled earlier this year that the judge had to explain in detail the justification on why he downgraded her sentence.
The judge came back and ruled Locane will not have to spend another day in prison for the crime. During the hearing, he noted that her conduct since her 2015 release from prison shows she is not a threat to society.

The victim’s family, who previously had filed a civil lawsuit against the actress demanding damages for the death of their mother and wife, has been battling it out in court for years with Locane due to multiple delays.
At one point, the actress blamed Fred Seeman for causing the accident, claiming in legal docs that she offered $1.5 million to settle the lawsuit, which the family shot down and asked for more money in damages.
And Locane had been repeatedly pleading her rights under the Fifth Amendment and refusing to answer questions during depositions in the legal battle, citing the fact that an ongoing appeal in her criminal was still pending.

In a court filing their lawyer blasted: “There was no deposition because Ms. Locane refused to answer any questions. My position is quite simple, if she is going to testify at trial, we have a right to take her deposition.”
Radar has now learned that earlier this month, docs were filed in the case revealing Locane finally has agreed to be deposed and waive her Fifth Amendment privilege. The family fears the move is just another delay tactic to drag out the case even longer due to the quickly approaching scheduled trial date in October.
The family also accuses Locane of refusing to be grilled until all of the other parties are deposed and their expert reports submitted, which would reveal their trial theories.

Adding fuel to the fire, the Seeman family points out Locane, without informing anyone, already chose to throw out her Fifth Amendment rights when she gave a college lecture and it was covered by WCBS-TV News. During the lecture, Locane spoke candidly, and without privilege, and admitted her guilt by conceding her drunkenness was the cause of the deadly 2010 accident.
“All the while, Defendant Locane stood silent before this court, apparently waiting for Plaintiffs to not only spend large sums on their expert reports, but then gain the advantage of reading those expert reports before subjecting herself to deposition,” complained Seeman family lawyers.
The Seemans are now requesting the judge hear the case in court as soon as possible.

Did Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi Ad Cross a Legal Line with the San Francisco Police Department?/n

Pepsi’s disgraced ad featuring Kendall Jenner is now receiving legal heat from the San Francisco Police Department.

The ambiguous protest commercial, which was pulled out of circulation earlier in the week, has the SFPD wondering if the “police” costumes worn by the actors unlawfully replicate the official emblems on their uniforms.
TMZ reports:
You see an emblem on the cop’s shirt sleeve with the words, “San Francisco Police.” There’s also an eagle spreading its wings … pretty much like the real SFPD uniforms except the color scheme is different.
Sources at the San Francisco PD tell us Pepsi never asked permission to mimic their uniforms. What’s more, the sources say they’re working with the City Attorney to determine if producers crossed the legal line by using the logo, which the City considers proprietary

Kate Moss Marries -- Congratulations Mrs. Hince!/n
By Radar Staff
Congratulations, Kate Moss, or should that be Kate Hince?
The 37-year-old super model wed long time love Jamie Hince in Southrop, Oxforshire on Friday afternoon and RadarOnline.com has the photos. The ceremony took place in St. Peter’s Church and the controversial cat-walker wore a white vintage inspired John Galliano gown, despite rumors that she would design her own wedding dress.
PHOTOS: Kate Moss Marries Jamie Hince
Moss paired the stunning gown with Manolo Blahnik pumps and adorned her golden blonde hair, worn loose and natural, with a floral headband and veil. Equally fashion-forward Jamie, who plays guitar for the band The Kills, wore a light blue suit and sunglasses.
The happy couple posed for photos surrounded by their super cute pint-sized bridesmaids and in true newlywed style, happily kissed for the camera.
PHOTOS:  Model Wives
Fifteen bridesmaids attended to the bride, including Kate’s eight-year-old daughter, Lila Grace. The wedding is said to have cost over $500,000 and will last three days. Fellow model Naomi Campbell arrived moments after the bride in an eye popping, bright yellow, skintight dress.
Ever the party girl, Kate hit up her local pub, The Swan in Southrop, the night before the nuptials and enjoyed a glass of champagne with her brother Nick and ex-boyfriend and baby daddy, Jefferson Hack.

Kate was previously engaged to actor Johnny Depp, and embattled Libertines frontman Pete Doherty, but neither ever made it to the altar.

Drake, who?

Romance rumors are swirling again for Jennifer Lopez after word spread that the “Ain’t Your Mama” singer is dating baseball player Alex Rodriguez.
“They’ve been quietly dating for a couple months,” the insider details to LoveBScott.com, explaining that J.Lo called things off with Drizzy after hearing rumors that he was hooking up with adult film star Rosee Divine on the side. “[They] haven’t gone public yet, but I can confirm this is absolutely true.”
The source adds, “He was with her in Vegas during this latest leg of her Planet Hollywood Vegas show. They were all coupled up behind the scenes, not public, but absolutely not hiding their relationship around close friends and family. It is definitely for real.”

An insider also tells Page Six that the new couple “are really into each other because they have so much in common — from their Latin roots, to their love of New York, and their kids.”
The powerhouse duo have two children each from their past respective marriages. Lopez share 9-year-old twins Max and Emme with Marc Anthony, while Rodriguez is the dad to daughters Natasha, 12, and Ella, 8.
A-Rod was previously linked to Kate Hudson, Cameron Diaz, Madonna and WWE star Torrie Wilson. The 41-year-old athlete was married to Cynthia Scurtis for six years before separating in 2008.
As reported, Lopez’s relationship with Drake ended in early February just after two months of dating. Though things looked to be serious when the 47-year-old introduced the Canadian rapper to her children, the romance reportedly fizzled out due to their hectic work schedules.

 Mark your calendars Twi-hards! Twilight: The Musical is coming to New York for one night only! According to the press notes, the musical, which parodies the books and films, “examines our culture’s obsession with the supernatural through the story of  Bella Swan who risks everything when she embarks on a star-crossed romance with Vampire Edward Cullen.”
Celebuzz was able to chat with Jenna Leigh Green, who plays both Rosalie and Esme Cullen (as well as Hermione. Yes, there’s a Harry Potter twist!) in the show. So is she ready to take on the Twi-hards? The actress tells us:

“This show is going to appeal to the lovers and haters. Let’s be honest, it’s a ridiculous saga,” she said, clarifying that she’s a huge Twilight fan. “As awesome and as silly as it is, I’ve  read all the books and all the movies. As soon as I heard Twilight: The  Musical, I said, ‘Yes!’… But when you really think about the whole story, it is ridiculous. I mean, a girl willing to die for her vampire boyfriend? Seriously?!”

Although the musical does poke fun at the franchise, Jenna believes the Twilight movie cast would thoroughly enjoy the parody, even challenging them to attend and laugh at themselves and the franchise.
“Everyone has to have a sense of humor about everything they’re a part of. I’d assume that the actors involved in the series are proud of their work, but at the same time, I would guess they all have a huge sense of humor about it… Like if Robert Pattison or Kristen Stewart came to the show, I think they’d be spitting with laughter. It’s all in good fun,” she added.
In the musical, which is set in the same vein as 39 Steps, Jenna and  the cast will be playing multiple roles, quickly changing within the  same scene. The musical won’t just be about vampires though. Jenna  reveals there’s a Harry Potter twist, hinting that Harry, Ron and Hermione all make a “significant appearance,” which includes  “a bit of a power struggle.”

Although Twilight: The Musical has some people up in arms, Jenna explains that “it’s not the end of the world.”
“It’s light-hearted and fun. We are laughing at and loving the series all at the same time. It’s meant to poke fun at our society and our obsession with the series. Honestly, it’ll be a night of hysterical laughter,” she said.
This musical will take place on Jan. 16 at 8 PM at New World Stages. For more information, visit www.thetwilightmusical.com.

 Got To Give It Up! Paula Patton ‘Upset’ Ex-Husband Robin Thicke Lost Lawsuit To Marvin.../n
On March 10, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered by a California federal jury to pay Marvin Gaye’s estate $7.3 million in damages for copyright infringement over their hugely successful chart-topping hit, “Blurred Lines.” But it is not only Thicke and Williams that were disappointed by the ruling : RadarOnline.com has spoken to a close friend of his ex-wife Paula Patton’s, who says that she is “incredibly pi**ed off that Marvin Gaye’s estate was awarded the money.”
As Radar reported, Gaye’s family countersued Thicke, 38, Williams, and Clifford Harris Jr., also known as T.I., for $25 million after the three preemptively petitioned for a jury to decide whether or not their 2013 song violated copyright laws, following claims they ripped off Gaye’s hit “Got To Give It Up.”
According to a friend of the 39-year-old Baggage Claim actress, who has been separated from Thicke for more than a year, “Any money that comes out of Robin’s pocket comes out of her pocket too.”
PHOTOS: You Can Sue For That? The 53 Wackiest Lawsuits
“The endless money that she used to have when ‘Blurred Lines’ came out” is in jeopardy, said the source, “and her ex’s reputation has been tarnished forever.”
“That song was the jackpot for the both of them and was his career high point,” the insider tells Radar. “Now it is clearly his downfall.”
However, it is a much different story on the other side of the court, as Radar has also spoken to a longtime music producer of Gaye’s, who tells Radar that the family “finally feels that justice has been served in the case.”
“The estate was very glad that Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke’s money couldn’t sway the jury. Marvin would be very pleased .”

Between Russia’s hacking, Julian Assange’s steady drip of private emails and Oliver Stone’s justifiable paranoia, 2016 has been a year preoccupied with the transparency of elected officials and our right to privacy, and it looks like the trend will continue next year. The trailer for Emma Watson and Tom Hanks’ new film The Circle was just released teasing a terrifying future determined to eradicate the world of secrets.

Mae Holland (Watson) is a twenty-something who lands her first job at a cutting-edge technology company that aims to rid the world of privacy and help civilization achieve its potential. Hanks is Bailey, the company’s brilliant, mysterious leader who proclaim to his employees: “Because knowing is good, but knowing everything is better.”
As you can guess, all is not well in this utopian, Google-esque corporation. Soon, Holland learns just how powerful The Circle actual is and what they aim to control.
The film is based on Dave Egger’s 2013 novel of the same name and also stars Bill Paxton, Patton Oswalt and John Boyega.
The Circle arrives April 18, 2017.

Wounded Soldier Is Reunited With The Puppy He Rescued In War Zone/n
By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
A puppy who was plucked from the front lines in war torn Afghanistan and tucked safely in a backpack will soon be reunited with the soldier who saved his life.
The floppy-eared grey and white pup crawled into the heart of thousands of Americans when an iconic photo of him appeared on the cover of Army Life magazine last year, with his head poking out sleepily from Donny Eslinger‘s backpack.
Eslinger, of Seminole County, Florida, was serving in Afghanistan last August when he rescued Smoke, who quickly became a morale booster when a member of Donny’s company was killed the next day, reported the Orlando Sentinel.
PHOTOS: Rescued Pup Reunited With Soldier 
“Smoke was the only bit of morale that made these kids forget where they were and cope with the tragedy we just experienced. It is amazing how therapeutic a little creature can be,” revealed Staff Sergeant Daniel, squad leader for B Co. 1-24 Infantry Battalion of the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team.
Man and dog quickly became inseparable, but just more than a month later it was Eslinger who was hit by a mortar, suffering a penetrating chest wound, a head injury, broken ribs and leg, and lost his spleen.
PHOTOS: Check Out The Adorable And Playful Baby Koala
He underwent emergency surgery at Kandahar Airfield Hospital before returning to America for treatment at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where President Barack Obama later presented him with the Purple Heart for being injured in the line of duty.
When Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger Sr. headed to Walter Reed to visit his son on Monday, he took a very special companion with him.
PHOTOS: Baby Elephant Throws Tantrum At Weigh-In
Now seven months old, Smoke landed at Orlando International airport last week after a five-month flight by Donny’s fellow soldiers to unite them.
The pair will be back side-by-side soon, and Donny has told his dad he can’t wait to pet his pup again.

Eslinger is currently scheduled for more exploratory surgery on his chest wound, along with a procedure to replace a portion of his skull that had to be removed with a metal plate.
“There is nothing physically that would prevent him from making a full recovery,” said his father. “He’s doing remarkably well. I’m just so proud of him and how far he has come.”

So Frances McDormand, what do you really think of the 2015 Emmy Awards?As soon as Kerry Washington said her name for Outstanding Actress in a Limited Series/Movie, the Olive Kitteridge star didn't seem that impressed.With little to no makeup on, the actress hurried on stage with few smiles as she thanked a few (and we mean few) people."My colleagues have already given thank you's that need to be said," she explained to the audience. "We're all here because of the power of a story well told. Sometimes, that's enough. Thank you."Perhaps she's being mindful of the mental health plot in the story. Maybe she wants to give us flashbacks to the 2015 Golden Globes. Or maybe, she simply wants all of the attention to be on her co-stars instead of her.

It certainly appeared to be the latter when Richard Jenkins claimed his award for Outstanding Actor in a Limited Series/Movie."I would like to thank the incredible women who made Olive Kitteridge happen," he joked as Frances started to LOL. "And there's about 100,000 of them."She then appeared to get emotional when Richard turned the focus to his co-star. "I want to say thank you Frances McDormand for this opportunity and calling me and saying I want you to come on this journey with me. Thank you Fran for letting me surf your enthusiasm and your artistry for four months, it was a ball."And just when we thought she couldn't handle anymore, Frances appeared onstage with the cast and crew to accept the award for Outstanding Limited Series."Yay, HBO, yay! Thank you to everyone who birthed this baby," she said with much enthusiasm. "And it was started as a book! Thank you."

Vince The Rhino Brutally Murdered By Poachers At French Zoo/n

This isn't just inhumane; it's inhuman.
In the first known European case of poaching from a zoo, a rhinoceros named Vince was brutally murdered in his enclosure at Parc Zoologique de Thoiry's African Animal Park Reserve, near Paris.

Poachers apparently broke into the zoo and shot the white rhino three times in the head before cutting off one of its horns with a chainsaw. The other horn was only partially cut, leading investigators to believe the criminals may have been interrupted.
In a Facebook statement, Thoiry gave details on the tragedy: 

"Vince was found this morning by his carer who, very attached to animals, is deeply affected… This heinous act was carried out despite the presence of five members of the zoological staff living on site and surveillance cameras… The other two white rhino living in Thoiry, Gracie 37 years old and Bruno 5 years of age, have escaped the massacre and are safe and sound."
Vince had been a resident at Thoiry since 2015.
White rhino horn is prized for its uses in some Asian medicine (mostly sex related) and thus can sell for up to $220K on the black market.
BTW, if you ever come across someone who still believes in the power of rhino horns, you can tell them that chemically, it's nearly indistinguishable from your fingernail clippings. And also, magic isn't real. Stupid jerks.
R.I.P. Vince.

Decades after the duet that thrust Kenny Rogers into a secret affair with Dolly Parton, the ailing country crooner is poised to make his final appearance with the woman who got away!

Richard Gere and Carey Lowell's Divorce Finalized Three Years After They Split/n
Richard Gere and Carey Lowell are officially over. Just over three years after the Hollywood couple initially separated, E! News can confirm their divorce was finalized Tuesday. Details of the settlement were not immediately disclosed. The Pretty Woman star and Lowell tied the knot in 2002, seven years after Gere split from supermodel Cindy Crawford in 1995. Richard and Carey share one child together, a 16-year-old son named Homer.

When Lowell filed for divorce, insiders told Page Six, who was first to report the news, their romance turned south over lifestyle differences. According to the outlet, 67-year-old Gere preferred privacy while Lowell, 55, enjoyed socializing. In 2015, E! News reported Richard had found love again with 33-year-old Spanish socialite Alejandra Silva. The two were recently spotted in June getting cozy on the red carpet of the Taormina Film Festival in Italy. 

Gere was previously linked to Padma Lakshmifor about six months back in 2014.

The Game Of Thrones Season Seven Finale Was Full Of Death, Sex, & Winter! The Dragon And The Wolf Recap HERE!/n

[This post is dark and FULL OF SPOILERS!!]
The Game of Thrones season seven finale promised a meet up of the biggest players in Westeros — and boy, did it deliver.
Fans were certainly looking forward to Sunday's showing of GoT as the episode, titled The Dragon And The Wolf, teased the potential of a Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hookup. Not to mention, many speculated that the title foreshadowed Snow would FINALLY learn about his royal lineage.
Related: There's Sexy Jon Snow Halloween Costume…
Although, as Cersei Lannister was seen attending the Fellowship Of The Ring rulers meet-and-greet in the trailer, it's safe to assume nothing went according to plan. Soooooo, what exactly happened during The Dragon And The Wolf?
Get all the juicy deets from the finale for yourself (below)! 
Queen vs. Queen vs. King

Queen Cersei Lannister finally faced her enemies, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, in order to discuss the impending threat in the north. Things were understandably tense as estranged family members came face to face for the first time in seasons. We mean, for starters, we had the awkward tension between Cersei and her Targaryen-loyal brother, Tyrion Lannister. But let's not forget about the epic feud between Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Sandor Clegane.
Nonetheless, the familial drama was put aside so that Cersei and co. could see for themselves that wights are indeed real. Although it took a bit of convincing, Cersei ultimately agreed to a truce and promised to send her armies north — a promise she doesn't intend to keep.
The Demise Of Petyr Baelish

Sansa Stark is done being used as a pawn. As you may recall, ever since Arya Stark returned to Winterfell things have been tense between the Stark sisters. Mainly, because Petyr Baelish has been planting the seed that Arya is dangerous and a threat to Sansa's current hold over the north.
Despite once being the most gullible person in Westeros, Sansa has learned quite a bit from her manipulation lessons with Littlefinger, so she was able to realize that he was (once again) trying to use her. Thus Sansa and Arya, with the help of brother Bran Stark, tricked Petyr into standing trial for murder and treason. In an EPIC speech, Sansa called out Littlefinger for being the cause of their family's many tragedies.
In typical Littlefinger fashion, Baelish tried to talk himself out of trouble. It didn't work though as Assassin Arya slit his throat. Boy, bye!

Original 'E.T.' Movie Poster Art Going for SIX Figures!/nThe art that became the iconic poster for  "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial " is hittin' the auction block, and it ain't gonna be cheap ... as in you'll have to trade in a car -- or 2 or 3 -- just to make a bid.  Heritage Auctions is selling the original art piece, which was painted by famed artist John Alvin -- who's also done art for  "Star Wars, "  "The Goonies, "  "Blazing Saddles " and a bunch of other hit movies. We're told it should rake in $150,000 ... at the bare minimum. At first, the piece belonged to Hollywood producer Bob Bendetson, who got it directly from Universal Studios years ago. It was hanging in his office for years, but now that his wife's turning that into a guest room -- he's ditching 'E.T.' The artwork goes on the block October 12th. If you're on a budget, there's always the knockoff poster. /n

Sordid Affairs & Reckless Behavior! Inside New Prince Charles Biography/n
Prince Charles and Princess Diana were doomed from the start, according to Sally Bedell Smith‘s explosive new tell-all, Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life.
The book claims Prince Charles cried the night before his wedding in 1981, with the couple sleeping in separate bedrooms by 1984.
“In 1980 — more than a decade after the sexual revolution had started — he was hemmed in by the royal custom of marrying a virgin, or at least a woman who seemed virginal,” Smith wrote. “He was forced, in effect, to rob the cradle. . .the 12-year gap between Charles and Diana was essentially unbridgeable.”
PHOTOS: Prince Harry’s Girlfriend Caught Getting Cozy With Her Bodyguard
As Radar readers know, Charles and Diana never had the perfect marriage. And both were notorious for their affairs.
Indeed there are STILL lingering questions about just who is the father of Prince Harry. Many believe Harry’s dad is really Diana’s former lover, riding instructor James Hewitt. Meanwhile, Charles carried on an affair for many years with now-wife Camilla Parker Bowles.
“They had no intellectual connections, few mutual friends, no interests in common and none of the shared life experiences he would have had with a contemporary,” the book continued. “Although Camilla had the same limited upper-class education, she was on Charles’ wavelength — absorbed as he was by hunting and other country pursuits, at home in the same social circle — in a way Diana could never be.”
PHOTOS: Prince Harry’s Girlfriend Goes Back To Work After Nude Photo Scandal
The book also claimed Princess Diana was so unhappy she threw herself down the stairs while she was three-months pregnant, and even slashed her wrists on other occasions.
Sources alleged Princess Di often taunted Charles, saying he “would never be King” and would “hit [him] over the head” when he prayed by the bed at night.
Prince Charles “dealt with Diana’s bewildering and often infuriating behaviour by placating her, trying to distract her and, ultimately, out of frustration, abandoning her,” the book asserted.
The royal couple announced their separation in 1992, announcing their divorce four years later in 1996. One year after that, Princess Diana died in a high-speed car crash in Paris with her lover Dodi Fayed.

Once your dreams came true … you left the country and received your fame. You forgot me and I let you. I felt so lied to while I gave you all my trust.”
She blasted Depay, “You left me heartbroken, left without any explanation, exchanged me with your favorite celebs list like I never existed. You are the worst lie a woman can ever go through in her life. I feel sorry for everyone who still believes in you.”
More than a year later, El Har told Radar exclusively that she still feels burned, but is trying to move on.

“Now they are engaged, I wish them all the good luck and blessings and I do not want the past to take their shine away.”

 Khloé Kardashian Debates 'Stepping Away' From Husband Lamar Odom On KUWTK Finale,.../n
Khloe Kardashian admitted her troubled marriage to Lamar Odom was more than she can handle on the season finale of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.
As RadarOnline.com has extensively reported, Khloe and the basketball star have been on the rocks for months due to his chronic infidelity and drug problems.
And the TV reality star’s marital meltdown wound up being the cliffhanger ending on Sunday night’s KUWTK — with viewers left hanging on whether Khloe and Lamar’s marriage would survive!
PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Slammed The Kardashians
“I’m at war with myself,” Khloe told E!’s cameras about her relationship. “I want to help him but maybe sometimes the best help is stepping away.”
And, in the final line on KUWTK’s season 8 ender, a devastated Khloe commented, “I just feel like I might need some more help so I have to kind of tell my family.”
On Sunday night’s episode, Khloe poured her heart out to brother Rob Kardashian, who had been living with his sister and Lamar and privy to their marital woes.
Over lunch at the Four Seasons Hotel, Khloe vented to her brother because people were contacting her about Lamar being MIA.
“It’s sad but still, it’s like, you’ve tried so many times,” Rob told her. “It’s not like it was a week of this, a month of this.”
PHOTOS: Reality TV’s Top Families
Khloe told him, “Yeah, but, no one knows that but you because you’ve lived there.”
The Kardashian sister then revealed to the cameras, “A lot has been going on the past couple years, just with me and Lamar and I’ve made that choice myself to just keep that within my marriage.
“But lately, it’s getting bigger than me.”
Khloe shared with Rob that her marital problems had caused a media firestorm.
“It’s scary and there’s a lot going on and there’s paparazzi, like hundreds, that just wait outside my gate. It’s not easy,” she sighed.
“Sometimes things are bigger than yourself and I don’t have a plan. I don’t know what the next step is,” Khloe added in a confessional segment.

Rob told his sister about Lamar, “He’s so lovable … and he’s a great athlete. It sucks. It’s just never been this way. All you can do is pray and just keep trying if you want to try. If not …”
“What am I supposed to do?” Khloe asked Rob. “I’ve done everything.”
Rob said, “I know. You have to let him figure it out.”
Khloe said, “If someone, God forbid, gets their legs cut off or you get breast cancer, do you just leave someone because they’re slowing down your life? I’m trying to help and save.”
“It’s worse than that because he’s really hurting you,” Rob pointed out. “It’s not even a win situation for anybody.”
Rob then broke the bad news to Khloe — that he was moving out of the home he’d shared with her and Lamar.

Although Khloe considered it bad timing, Rob, who has battled shocking weight gain and depression all season, said he was “in desperate need of fixing myself. I need to be healthy, I need to work out, I need to get out of that bad energy.”
Rob said in confessional, “I hate to see my sister hurt and it’s just sad to see someone who’s my best friend and my brother going through a really dark period because he’s part of our family.”
E!’s cameras then showed a flashback to Rob clowning around with Lamar.
“It’s definitely time for me to get out of that house because I’ve been holding in so much,” Rob told KUWTK viewers.
“As much as I love and respect my sister Khloe and want to be there for her, I really need to fix myself.”
He then told Khloe, “Maybe it’s time for a change for everybody.”

His sister sighed in confessional, “Even though I understand why Rob wants to move out, I wish him and I could live together forever.
“I mean, that’s me being selfish but I get it. It’s not the best environment right now to be in.”
Rob assured Khloe that he wasn’t moving far away and if she needed him, he’d be right down the street.
A sad Khloe recalled for the cameras how she and Lamar fell in love instantly and wound up married in 30 days.
After a flashback to their proposal and wedding, Khloe said, “I’ve done so many things on my own and tried to put the pieces back together on my own.
“Obviously I’d love to help him and let him live his life but I don’t know what else to do.”
Sunday’s episode revolved around the Odom’s problems, as Khloe’s sister Kourtney told her baby daddy Scott Disick how weird it was that Lamar had never even been to their house!
“We’ve never gone out to dinner” with Khloe and Lamar, Kourtney marveled.

And “they live ten minutes down the road!” Scott pointed out.
Later, Scott and Rob made fun of the way Lamar spoke, and Kourtney said, “I don’t know what goes on in that house.
“They kind of live in their own world,” she told the cameras.
“I just want to get to know him better,” Kourtney commented about her brother-in-law Lamar.
Then, Khloe had to make excuses about Lamar’s whereabouts after getting a call from Jeff Schwartz, the NBA player’s agent.
She admitted to the KUWTK cameras, “As many times as I’ve protected Lamar or dodged a bullet for him, lately everything is getting more than what I can protect or control — I’m getting bombarded with questions and I don’t know what to say.”
Another Sunday night storyline revolved around Kylie Jenner‘s sweet 16 party and momager Kris Jenner‘s attempt to plan it all for Kylie — but the determined teen decided to do her own party planning!

Later, the two got into a tiff when Kris reorganized Kylie’s room behind her back.
Kylie shouted at Kris, “I’m not 6-years-old!”
And when Khloe came over to the Jenner home, Kylie cried to her, “I want to move out so bad.”
Khloe begged her mom to ask Kylie before getting rid of her stuff, and later helped her little sister prank Kris by trying to dispose of some of HER clothes.
Meanwhile, however, Kris had a new “child,” a little pig that daughter Kendall was supposed to take care of. When she went out of town on a modeling assignment, however, Kris became attached to the pig she named Wilbur and wouldn’t let her go.
Later, Kylie and her mom put their differences behind them and all enjoyed the teen’s Alice in Wonderland-themed party.
The whole gang was dancing and Kris took the mike to tell her she loved her.
“She’s all grown up,” Kris concluded.
The only downer at Kylie’s sweet 16 bash was Kourtney and Scott’s war over his drinking, as RadarOnline.com previously previewed.
Lord Disick found himself harassed by a group of teen boys in the bathroom at the party, but Kourtney wasn’t sympathetic.

“You’re disgusting. I have to go,” Kourtney said, while Scott was insisting the kids were bugging him in the bathroom.
Then Kourt accused Scott of kissing Kris!
“My mom told me you were sucking on her face,” Kourtney smiled to Scott, but he denied it as the two finally made up.
However, it’s doubtful Khloe and Lamar will do the same after the KUWTK finale made clear how deep their problems really are. /n

Sadly, Huston has only spent one day on the set thus far, and that was with Reed, much to his relief."She's actually a real sweetie and the very first day she made me feel very welcome," he says. "We were away from the madness which is, I think, Robert and Kristen. I think they have hundreds of incessant fans following them, which, fair enough. We were quite lucky. We were in the park, beautiful, and it was fun."The hottie, who's often compared to Johnny Depp, doesn't worry that those incessant fans will throw things at him because of the nature of his "cameo"-sized character."I hope not," he says. "I'll be like, 'It's not me, I'm an actor! I'm not really evil. I'm a nice guy.'"Huston, who also can be seen in ABC's upcoming show Eastwick and walking red carpets alongside his girlfriend, So You Think You Can Dance's Cat Deeley, is humbled to be involved in the vampy franchise."It's a great film to be a part of," he says. "This is a small part, but a relevant part in the movie. I think it'll be cool. Hopefully."Swoon.

WATCH: Real Life Golden Girls Sophia and Rose Prove that Furry Friendships are Real
/n
Thank you for being a friend.
That’s what a nearly blind dog named Sophia would likely say to Rose, her very best friend.
The dogs, who share names with two of our favorite Golden Girls, were abandoned together at the playard at the Atlanta Humane Society — but the true strength of their bond wouldn’t show itself until they were separated during medical care.
“We were housing them separately and the older dog, Sophia, was miserable,” says Christina Hill, director of marketing and communications for the AHS. “She growled at anyone who went near her and refused to be friendly. She would just cower in the back of her cage.”

Sadly, they determined that Sophia, in addition to her eye issues, was also heartworm positive, but before they started treatment, they had an idea.
“Sophia was incredibly depressed and wouldn’t let any one touch her. We wanted to see if having someone familiar around would lift her spirits and found a space where her and Rose could be together,” Hill says. “Immediately, Sophia’s attitude flipped. She was confident, happy and started to jump up into our laps.”
Sophia’s reliable buddy Rose helps guide the elderly pup around, staying close at all times. Even when Sophia goes to take a nap, Rose hops up into the bed and lays down beside her (a Facebook video of the pair in action, viewed over 12,000 times, will tug at the heartstrings).

“They’re inseparable best friends,” Hill adds. “We want to find a loving home where the two can live together because they have such a close bond. We don’t want these two best friends to be separated. Without each other, they’d be lost.”
If you’re interested in adopting these two, contact the Atlanta Humane Society.

Jennifer Lawrence Shades Unnamed Celebrities on ‘Watch What Happens Live’/n





                    Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence Answer Every Question You Have About Them
                







Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are on a mission.

 MORE >>





During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Jennifer Lawrence and her best friend Laura Simpson let us all in on a little secret.

The game started out simply enough. Host Andy Cohen asked Simpson a few questions about her best friend, hoping some dirt would come out. Questions ranged from Lawrence’s worst diva moments (she doesn’t have many) to her celebrity crush (Larry David).
Things got interesting when Cohen asked Simpson what the meanest thing Lawrence has said about a celebrity. After mentioning that there’s one person they both “collectively loathe,” in the words of Lawrence, Simpson revealed that they have nicknames for certain stars.
“There’s The Lady, there’s Pickle. Wait, who else do we have?” Simpson said.
Lawrence clarified that “The Lady” has a few different variations, including “The Raging Lady,” The Lady in Red” and “The Lady in Waiting.” Hmm… Who could “The Raging Lady” be? Watch the video above for the full game.

During another game, according to E! Online, Lawrence kept quiet when asked about her love life. During a game of “Plead the Fifth,” she elected to, well, plead the Fifth when Cohen asked who her best kiss of 2016 was with. E! points out that Lawrence likely didn’t want to talk about her boyfriend, director Darren Aronofsky, on TV.
Later, when Cohen asked if Lawrence had a boyfriend (um… does he read Celebuzz?), Lawrence blushed and said nothing.

Colorado Army Sergeant 'Beyond Lucky' to Have Survived Lightning Strike on Motorcycle During Rush Hour/n
Eugene Villines has spent the past week stuck in a hospital bed, doctors and nurses tending to his broken body, as he asks himself why he is still alive.  
“I feel beyond lucky to still be here,” Villines, a Colorado National Guardsman, tells PEOPLE.   
He should.   
On Aug. 17, while riding his motorcycle back to Greely, Colorado, from his active-duty post with the National Guard’s aviation unit, Villines noticed an afternoon storm rolling in.  
Minutes later, while he barreled down I-25 north of Denver, a blinding flash of lightning lit up the highway – and horrified motorists watched helplessly as the 31-year-old Army staff sergeant slumped over his motorcycle after being struck, his hands still tightly gripping the handlebars.  
Time seemed to slow down as the unconscious Villines drifted across lanes of rush-hour traffic, miraculously avoiding the cars around him, eventually veering off the right shoulder of the highway as his bike went airborne and crashed.   
“The second I got hit, I was completely out,” says Villines, who woke up seven hours later in a hospital bed at the University of Colorado Hospital Burn Center. “I don’t remember anything. But people who saw what happened told me it was like the traffic all around me opened up, like it was all meant to be.”  
A handful of motorists pulled over and tended to his unconscious body, which had three broken ribs, a collapsed lung and a variety of scrapes and bruises, along with burns on his shoulder and hand where the lightning entered and exited his body.  
On average, 49 people die each year from lightning strikes, mostly due to injuries to their hearts and lungs.    
“I’ve done three tours and done some pretty dangerous stuff,” Villines says. “But this takes the cake.”  
(It even came with a new nickname, courtesy of his buddies, who now call him “Volt.”)  
Villines’s wife Katie says she is still “in shock” over the fact that her husband is alive. She tells PEOPLE she has her own theory about what happened.  
“Everyone is saying his helmet saved him, but I think God had a little to do with it,” she says. “We’re so lucky we still have him. We’re going to make sure we get our butts back to church and try to understand why he wasn’t killed.”

honest about his childhood and lack of relationship experience. The fact that he's never been in love is a big concern for Rach's pregnant sister Constance, but Eric says he's "not a fairy tale person" and grew to th.../n
To be continued.Yes, once again, The Bachelorette has gone and TBC'd us, meaning we are heading into the Aug. 7 finale with three men still in the running...midway through an overnight date. As Chris Harrison would say: it's shaping  up to be the most dramatic final rose ever!In tonight's episode, Rachel Lindsay introduced her final three men, Bryan Abasolo, Eric Bigger and Peter Kraus, to her family in Dallas, minus her father (a federal judge), hoping to get some clarity as she makes this huge decision. And guess what? It seems like one of the guys really failed to make a good first impression on the Lindsay fam. Here's a quick rundown of each guys' meeting with Rachel's family: 

Peter: You know how Rachel was concerned that Peter didn't drop the L-bomb last week? Yeah, he knew he effed up because just before heading in to meet her family, he pulls her aside and tells her exactly who he's feeling. "You mean the world to me," he says. "I am falling in love with you." And he wasn't done, as he continued to express his feelings for Rach while at the dinner table in front of her family, with all of their eyes basically turning into heart emojis.But (come on, you knew a but was coming), just as Rachel feared, our salt and pepper prince is not ready to propose, as he tells her mom Kathy, "I really do care about your daughter…I don't necessarily know if in two weeks if I will feel that certainty." So no, he doesn't ask for her blessing to propose to Rachel, explaining he wants to wait until he knows for sure. Momma Lindsay is into this, but says, "I would hope the dating is as serious as marriage."And in case you weren't sure how much her family loved him, when they ask Rachel's three-year-old nephew to say his name, her aunt tells him to say "winner" instead of Peter. Hey-o!

Eric: Like Peter, Big E has a pretty great visit with Rachel's family, winning them over by being open and honest about his childhood and lack of relationship experience. The fact that he's never been in love is a big concern for Rach's pregnant sister Constance, but Eric says he's "not a fairy tale person" and grew to this point over time and that he's ready to settle down. "Moving forward, hopefully the best will happen...I can be the man I know I am," he says. "I can provide, protect and take care of everything."He continues this sentiment with her mother, telling her he wants a relationship based on "commitment, compromises, communication, sacrifice, understanding," before asking for her blessing to propose, which she gives if it's what her daughter wants. 

Bryan: Oh, Bryan. While he hits it off quite well with two of Rachel's friends (A meeting that included this line from Rachel about her first impression of him: "Let's just be real, I thought he was a douchebag! I really did, I was waiting for the charm to come off."), the same can't be said for his time with her family.When Bryan talks about his now-infamous mother, Olga, being the "number one woman" in his life, Rachel's mom asks where his loyalty would lie if it ever came down to Olga vs. Rachel. He says it would be with Rachel, but he wouldn't want them to have a strained relationship. (Did he miss the part last week were Olga threatened to kill her?) Kathy seems unconvinced.

And both Kathy and Constance are skeptical about Bryan's constant declarations of love, especially after he says he considered the Bachelorette his girlfriend from day one. Constance calls Bryan a "charmer" and questions his sincerity, and when he's grilled at the dinner table, he asks to be excused. And Rachel is PISSED, telling the group she is "low-key annoyed" and getting defensive over their treatment of Bryan. Later, Bryan sits down with Constance, who says all of Bryan's love talk is too soon for her (he even says he already loves the fam?!). And during his time with Rachel's mom, Bryan defends how fast his feelings developed before asking for her blessing to propose. While she's a little "wary," Kathy ultimately thinks Bryan is "honest" and gives him the go-ahead. After some quality fam time, Rachel and her three boyfriends are off to Spain to finish out this crazy adventure. And you know what time it is: Fantasy Suites!

The first overnight date goes to Eric, who is finally ready to tell Rachel he loves her. "I'm in love with you and I tried to run, week three, week four, and it's like, nah, E, that's not happening no more," he tells her. "This is it. and I'm here. I'm here for you. Rachel Lindsay, I love you."She doesn't say it back, but offers him the key to the fantasy suite and he accepts. So same diff? Next up is Peter's overnight, and this is where s--t gets really real and the couple finally has the talk about the fact that Peter probably won't propose at the end of this thing.

"I didn't come this far and put my life on hold and sacrifice everything I have to do this to just have a boyfriend at the end of it, that's not what I want," Rachel tells him. "I could've done that without all this." But Peter's not backing down, saying a proposal and marriage is one in the same for him, so no, he likely won't be getting down on one knee anytime soon. Rachel is crushed."This is devastating. It's absolutely devastating," she says through tears. "Tonight, for the first time ever, I am thinking Peter and I may not work out." AND THEN CUT TO BLACK. TO BE CONTINUED. GAH.

You know what's been LIT (Are kids still saying that?) this season? The man-chats, so here's a quick debrief on the three small-but-oh-so-good ones we got tonight: GUY-CHAT INTERLUDE NO. 1: Bryan and Eric discuss Peter's hesitance to propose after knowing Rachel for a few weeks.  "I'm confused!" a shocked Eric says. It's just protocol of being here!"GUY-CHAT INTERLUDE NO. 2: It's Bryan v. Peter, baby, and we LOVE it. When Peter tells Bryan he didn't ask Rachel's mom for her blessing, Bryan says he plans to show the family how much chemistry he has with Rachel before securing the approval to propose. "I'm like damn dude, that's a little ballsy and arrogant and it's annoying," Peter says in his ITM (in the moment) interview. But Peter wasn't done hatin' on Bryan yet!

GUY-CHAT INTERLUDE NO. 3: Peter and Eric discuss Bryan's general Miami-ness. "He's got a lot of Miami swagger. But in Miami there's a lot of fake boobs, fake asses and fake cheeks." Bryan must be toast 'cause he just got burnt by Peter!The Bachelorette: Men Tell All special airs next Monday at 8 p.m., with the finale airing on Monday, Aug. 7, at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Clinton Camp Knew Anthony Weiner Was Sexting Underage Teen — 5 Years Ago!/n
Hillary Clinton‘s staff knew that Anthony Weiner had been sexting an underage girl as early as 2011, and didn’t act, shocking new emails released by WikiLeaks revealed.
News of an investigation into Weiner’s alleged messaging with a 17-year-old girl was passed onto John Podesta, now chair of Clinton’s presidential campaign, and adviser Neera Tanden. At the time, the former congressman was still married to Clinton’s top aide, Huma Abedin.
After word got out that Weiner was reportedly sending explicit messages to yet another teen earlier this year [], Abedin announced that she had separated from her husband.

“Police on Friday afternoon came to the home of a 17-year-old high school junior to ask her about direct online communications she has had with Rep. Anthony Weiner,” the 2011 email read, quoting a Fox News article. “Two officers from the New Castle County Police Department arrived at the girl’s home around 4:30 p.m. and asked to speak with the girl’s mother about the daughter’s contact with Weiner. Another officer appeared at the home a short time later.”
Just six days later, Wiener resigned after accidentally posting a shirtless photo of himself to the Twittersphere.
Now, the shamed politician has a much bigger scandal on his hands — involving Hillary herself!

As Radar reported, the FBI reopened its investigation into Clinton’s private server — used during her time secretary of state — on Friday, after discovering new emails on a computer belonging to Weiner and Abedin.
According to the New York Times, senior law enforcement officials said that it was unclear if any of the emails were from Clinton’s private server.
The democratic nominee addressed the scandal during a rally in Florida on Saturday afternoon, slamming the FBI director’s announcement “unprecedented” and “deeply troubling,” ABC News reports.

Is Khloé Kardashian ready for motherhood?

Rumors are swirling after the reality star shared several polaroids of her birthday celebrations from this weekend. Though the Revenge Body host wasn’t sporting a noticeable bump, a certain caption written on the bottom of a a photo with Tristan Thompson got fans suspecting the 32-year-old was pregnant.
“Dad + Mom,” it read alongside a photo of Khloé feeding her NBA star beau some cake.

However, despite the rumors, TMZ is reporting the Strong Looks Better Naked author is not with child. Sources close to the family claim the titles are “just lovey dovey nicknames” the duo have for one another.
On a recent episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Khloé opened up about potentially having kids with Tristan. “He wants to have about five or six kids with me and that’s lovely,” she mused at the time. “We could start at one and we could grow from there.”
Tristan became a dad last year when his ex-girlfriend, Jordan Craig, gave birth to a son named Prince Oliver.

Simon, Theodore, LAWSUIT!!!/nThe brains behind  "Alvin and the Chipmunks " has been had by Capitol Records, at least according to the people he left behind -- and now they've filed suit. TMZ has obtained a lawsuit filed by Bagdasarian Productions against Capitol, alleging the record company used a number of Chipmunk songs without permission. In 1968, creator Ross Bagdasarian made an agreement with Capitol, allegedly stating that Capitol had the recording rights to the music, but that's basically it.According to the suit, filed Thursday in L.A. County Superior Court, Bagdasarian Productions claims Capitol effectively pilfered the music by making money in movies and other ventures outside the recording industry. So why, you ask, did it take the Bagdasarians so long to sue? According to the suit, shortly around the time Ross made the agreement, he moved on and opened a winery. Ross then died suddenly in 1972 and the family didn't even see the agreement until 2007.  The suit seeks Capitol punishment in the form of unspecified damages. Full disclosure -- TMZ's Harvey Levin went to summer camp with one of Ross' sons, but it was a long time ago.  Documents to follow .../n

Although Duggar and Caldwell have plenty of items on the registry for cooking, it seems they plan to eat out a lot!

That Game Of Thrones Season Finale Title Has Fans Hot & Bothered On Twitter!/n

Fire and Ice finally joined together on this season of Game Of Thrones — and hours of passionate arguing combined with heavy glances made it impossible for fans not to ship Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen.
Now, with the release of the upcoming finale's title — The Dragon and the Wolf — a large chunk of the fandom have a sneaking suspicion the biggest hookup in the history of Westeros is about to go down!
Yup, many believe Jon and Dany are about to get it on! Bow-chick-a-wow-oh — heyyyy Jorah, didn't see you there! Mind getting us some water? Thanks, you're the best.
Video: Sophie Turner & Maisie Williams Giggle Through Carpool Karaoke!
Before we get too ahead of ourselves, the titillating title could be referencing something else.
As we previously discussed, The Dragon and the Wolf may also be alluding to Jon Snow learning he's really the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Orrrr, another theory is Drogon and Ghost could be going on their own side adventure (lolz). Hell, maybe Tyrion finds a new pub called The Dragon and the Wolf. Who knows!
Either way, fans are hot and bothered over the possibilities! See the L-I-T reactions (below)!

Is Beckham Being Played?/nWhile Posh stirred things up in Hollywood this weekend, hubby David got the green light back home to breeze through the rest of the season with Real Madrid before heading to the L.A. Galaxy.  "He will practice, but he is not going to play, " coach Fabio Capello tells the New York Post.  "A player who has such a major contract with another team ... we cannot count on him. " With all that free time, Becks can daydream about what kind of digs that new $250 million contract can buy him in the States. Of course, it'll be hard to top their $13.6 million home in England – referred to as  "Beckingham Palace " – which features a $40,000 treehouse and $252,000 fort for their kids.  Britney's Gay Night Out Apparently, Britney's worn out her welcome at her regular Hollywood haunts.

Nothing happens, it's a joke, nothing ever happens. I think she's a very nice woman, but I don't want a nice woman. I want someone that's not necessarily nice. " Who is Trump's kind of woman?

Adopt Me! 3-Year-Old Oliver Still Plays Like a Puppy
/n
Home: Some pets never have one to call their own. We’d like to help change that by introducing you to an adoptable pet every week. Today, meet Oliver, a 3-year-old boxer mix available at the Providence Animal Rescue League in Rhode Island.
Oliver arrived at the shelter very skinny but as he now gains weight on a regular diet, people are seeing a significant change in him.
“He’s a goofy guy, and the healthier he gets the more we’re seeing his personality get playful,” said Jillian Ganley, a PARL adoption specialist.
This boy — who now weighs 40 lbs. — is playful with cats and enjoys going on long walks with other dogs. The perfect family for Oliver would have another canine for him to form a bond with.
“Oliver still plays like a puppy, so he’ll need a family who can brush up his manners,” says a bio. “He warms up to new people and loses his nervousness quickly. He really is a very appealing young fella!”

Under Fire! Fox News Hit With Three More Discrimination Lawsuits/n
Three more Fox News employees have come forward with claims of discrimination, making a total of 23 current and former staffers fighting against the network — and Radar has the exclusive details.
According to a press release from Wigdor LLP., a New York employment law firm representing the workers in the case, the new complaints were filed Monday on behalf of Kathleen Lee, Naima Farrow and Vidya Mann.
PHOTOS: Fox News Bombshell: Gretchen Carlson RECORDED Roger Ailes’s Creepy Sex Come-Ons
Lee, a shift editor at Fox News Radio, claims she experienced retaliation after reporting sexist and harassing behavior. Farrow, a former accounts payable coordinator, alleges her work environment became racially hostile less than three days after telling her supervisor she was pregnant and she was fired shortly thereafter. Mann, a former accounts receivables specialist who wasn’t listed as a permanent employee, claimed she faced racial discrimination and was fired after giving birth.
In addition, Wigdor LLP. now represents the Black IT employee who was the subject of Bob Beckel’s allegedly racist behavior on May 16, 2017.
Earlier this month, Douglas Wigdor met with Ofcom, the U.K. regulator considering whether to approve Fox’s acquisition of Sky, Bloomberg reports.

“Civil-rights activists have already pressed Ofcom to consider how Fox executives dealt with harassment complaints from employees against Bill O’Reilly and ex-Fox News President Roger Ailes, both of whom resigned over the scandal,” the publication stated.
As Radar readers know, Ailes died last week after suffering a blood clot at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.
Bill Shine, Fox News’ co-president, resigned recently as well.
UPDATE: 

From a FOX News spokesperson: 
“We have consistently demonstrated that the Company is committed to a diverse workplace that is free from all forms of discrimination, takes any complaint of discrimination seriously, and in these particular matters took prompt, effective and, where necessary, strong remedial action.  We believe these latest claims are without legal basis and look forward to proving that Fox News at all times has acted appropriately, and lawfully, in connection with these matters.”

Fire, Death & A Curse: The True Story Behind 'The Exorcist'/n
Terrifying and groundbreaking in equal measures, director William Friedkin‘s 1973 classic The Exorcist coupled what were extravagant special effects for its time with the feeling of a pared-down production to create a stunningly disturbing film that influenced dozens of horror hits in the years that followed.
Starring 13-year-old Linda Blair as the demonically possessed Regan MacNeil, the film became an instant box-office hit — despite outrage from religious groups who believed it glorified Satan. Televangelist Billy Graham even blasted, “There is a power of evil in the film, in the fabric of the film itself.”
Here, Radar reveals some of the long-hidden secrets behind one of the scariest movies ever made.
PHOTOS: The Craziest True Crime Cases Of 2016 … So Far!
“The Exorcist,” and the 1971 novel of the same name on which the film was based, was inspired by a true story: the 1949 exorcism of a young boy known by the pseudonym Ronald Doe. At the time, future novelist William Peter Blatty was a student at Georgetown University, which is why he set his story in Washington, D.C., near the college’s campus.
Friedkin never thought he was making a frightening film. “I know that it is considered by a great many people as a horror film,” he says. “I’ve never thought of it that way and I didn’t approach it that way. It’s a story about the mystery of faith.”
Linda was chosen for the part of 12-year-old Regan from nearly 600 girls, but she wasn’t sent by an agent to audition — she was brought to the Warner Bros. casting department by her mom!

Also considered for the shocking role were Denise Nickerson — who played Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory — and Anissa Jones — who starred in TV’s Family Affair as Buffy — but both girls were rejected for being too familiar to the public. The producers wanted an unknown actress.
Friedkin had first intended to use Linda’s electronically altered voice for Pazuzu — the profanity-spewing demon who inhabits helpless Regan — but decided the evil spirit needed more dramatic power than that would offer.
Oscar-winning star Mercedes McCambridge was tapped to dub Pazuzu’s dialogue. Mercedes, who won the Best Supporting Actress statue for her work in 1949’s “All the King’s Men,” had once been called “the world’s greatest living radio actress” by the legendary Orson Welles.

To roughen her voice for the role, Mercedes insisted on swallowing raw eggs, chain smoking and drinking whiskey — despite being a recovering alcoholic. Friedkin also arranged to have the actress bound to a chair during takes, so her voice would more accurately reflect that of the struggling demon.
Linda received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for The Exorcist  before it became common knowledge that Mercedes had voiced Pazuzu — but when the news leaked, the controversy likely ruined Linda’s chance of winning the coveted honor.
That wasn’t the only drama surrounding Mercedes’ involvement in the film. She wasn’t initially acknowledged in the movie credits — which Friedkin insisted was her choice — and later threatened legal action to be included. The parties never went to court, as Warner Bros. relented and began acknowledging her for the voice performance.

During the exorcism scenes — in which a priest tries to expel the demon from Regan’s body — the bedroom set was refrigerated to capture the foggy breath of the actors. Linda, who was clad in a thin nightgown during filming, says to this day she cannot stand being cold.
A series of strange occurrences during and after filming led some people to believe the set and movie were cursed.
At one point, shooting was delayed after the set for the MacNeil home caught fire. The blaze was blamed on a pigeon that found its way into a circuit box, but eerily, Regan’s bedroom survived without any damage. Ellen Burstyn — who played Regan’s struggling but devoted single mother, Chris — was injured during a scene in which the possessed child threw her to the floor — and the take was actually used in the film. Ellen’s blood-curdling scream was real!

While the movie was in production, the 5-year-old son of Jason Miller, who starred as Father Damien Karras, was nearly killed when he was struck by a motorcycle.
Jack MacGowran and Vasiliki Maliaros portrayed characters who died in the film, and neither actor lived to see its release, perishing while the movie was in post-production. Jack succumbed to the flu and Vasiliki died of natural causes.
Linda’s performance made an indelible mark on pop culture, but she insists Ellen was the film’s true star.
“Ellen is the heart and soul of ‘The Exorcist,’ ” says Linda, “and there would be no movie without her. She’s just extraordinary.”

Tiger's Manager Sued Over Alleged Shady Betting/nA blockbuster lawsuit was just filed against the company that manages Roger Federer and Tiger Woods, alleging the owner of the company bet millions of dollars on sporting events, used inside information to wager on a Federer match and bet against his own client, Tiger Woods.     IMG -- one of the biggest sports management companies in the world -- is being sued by a printing company, which allegedly served as a gambling go-between and even provided escorts for the owner of IMG, Theodore Forstmann.According to the suit, filed in L.A. County Superior Court and obtained by TMZ, Agate Printing, Inc. claims it made millions of dollars in bets on Forstmann's behalf, and that Forstmann covered some of his losses on IMG accounts.The suit claims Forstmann actually bet against some of his own clients -- in particular Tiger Woods.  In one case Forstmann allegedly bet against Tiger when he was competing against Vijay Singh, a  "so-called close personal friend " of Forstmann and client of IMG at the time.The suit alleges Forstmann loathed Tiger, often referring to him and other African Americans as  "schwartzas " -- and allegedly making other derogatory comments about  "blacks, Jewish people, and other minorities. "  The suit alleges Forstmann also criticized Woods' lifestyle decisions.And the suit goes on, alleging tennis star Roger Federer gave Forstmann inside information about a tennis match in which Federer competed. The suit claims in one case Forstmann raised his bet from $10,000 to $40,000 after receiving the inside info from Federer.  We're told the match in question was the 2007 French Open final.  Ironically, Federer lost to Rafael Nadal.The reason Agate filed suit -- because Forstmann allegedly breached an agreement to give his company printing business.  Agate also claims Forstmann left his company holding the bag on tax liabilities for the gambling losses.Forstmann's rep, Michael Sitrick, tells TMZ,  "The allegations in James Agate's complaint are beyond false, they are preposterous. "  Sitrick also says in an April, 2009 letter, Agate admitted concocting lies and spreading false information about Forstmann.  Sitrick says Agate filed a similar lawsuit against Forstmann in 2008 which was dismissed.  And Sitrick says,  "Unfortunately, people like Agate look at people like Forstmann as the lottery. "  No immediate comment from Federer's rep.To read Sitrick's full response on Forstmann's behalf, click here./n

New Walking Dead Set Photos Reveal THREE Survivors Of The Cliffhanger Finale! Find Out Who Negan Didn't Kill!/n

We're still recovering from the frustrating season finale of The Walking Dead, and we're more than ready to find out who Negan savagely beat to death with Lucille in the Season 6 cliffhanger.
Thankfully, the AMC horror hit is finally filming the seventh season, and new set photos have revealed at least a few characters who survived the wrath of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's killer debut.

The latest pics from the Senoia, Georgia set show  Andrew Lincoln, Danai Gurira, and Ross Marquand in costume and walking (in the good way) on set — meaning Rick, Michonne, and Aaron are (most likely) safe! Phew!
With those three off the chopping block, that narrows down the list to: Carl (Chandler Riggs), Glenn (Steven Yeun), Daryl (Norman Reedus), Rosita (Christian Serratos), Abraham (Michael Cudlitz), Maggie (Sonequa Martin-Green), or Eugene (Josh McDermitt).
Of course, the scene caught on camera by the paps could always be a flashback — director Greg Nicotero previously teased that the series could even be filming out of order to misdirect fans (as if we haven't been toyed around with enough already).
Who do YOU think is getting whacked?
Either way, prepare to say goodbye to yet another beloved character when The Walking Dead returns for Season 7 on October 23 at 9 PM ET on AMC.

Amber Portwood's Deadbeat Dad Fiancé Has Two Child Support Cases Dropped/n
Controversial Teen Mom OG star Matt Baier‘s life may have just gotten a little easier.
According to Indiana court records, Amber Portwood‘s 45-year-old fiancé is off the hook in two of his five child support cases in Madison County, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
On June 23, the state of Indiana filed a motion to dismiss two ongoing support claims against Baier, who as Radar exclusively revealed, has at least nine secret children with seven different women.

A judge tossed the cases four days later.
It is possible that the unemployed Boston native settled out of court with the two plaintiffs, both mothers with a combined three children in Baier’s brood. Or the women could be planning to refile in another court. (Both are from his Massachusetts.)
The reality groom-to-be, who originally confessed to having two children on TV before suspiciously changing his answer to five, still has plenty of baby mama drama to handle.

There’s a fashion battle brewing in the courts between designers Angelica Cota and L’Wren Scott, and we’ve got the docs right here on RadarOnline.com. 
Cota, who designs the label LuLA, is filing suit against fashion designer Scott, who’s just released her Lula handbag line.  
In her suit, Cota says Scott — the Oscar dress designer who once dated Mick Jagger — is using her patented name; Scott says Lula is named after her mother. 
EXCLUSIVE DOCS: Read The Lawsuit
According to the suit, the likelihood of confusion resulting from Scott’s use of the name “will irreparably harm [her] and will undo all of Cota’s hard work in establishing her own identity under the LuLA trademark.” 
Cota sells her handbags at Nordstrom and assorted boutiques; while Scott’s line sells at Barney’s.

Related: J.Law DETHRONED As Highest-Paid Actress!
The Hunger Games star previously gushed over her director beau, who is two decades her senior, in an interview with Vanity Fair — and it appears the admiration is mutual.
In an interview with Vulture, the Black Swan filmmaker revealed how J.Law surprised him on set with her extraordinary acting abilities and stamina, explaining: 
"During the big climax of the movie…she really went there. The producers were freaking out. We had to sort of calm it down and then go for it again. And the thing is, there's so much ability there that somehow she can summon it again and again."
Aronofsky added that Lawrence "hyperventilated and also kind of threw a rib out" while filming the psycho-thriller. (Eat your heart out, Natalie Portman!)
While Lawrence is never one to underperform, the 48-year-old wasn't sure he'd get such a penetrating performance from the Oscar winner based on how relaxed she was during rehearsals with Javier Bardem. He continued:
"I think there were a lot of things that the script asked that I have never seen her do, so I was trying to figure out how we were going to get there. And during the rehearsals, she was very, very relaxed…I really didn't get to know the character until we started shooting, and she showed up."
And after they stopped shooting, he really got to know his leading lady! The two began dating shortly after wrapping the film last September.
Will J.Law's acting chops live up to her director-boyfriend's hype? We'll find out when mother! hits theaters September 15.

“Jen has called off the divorce,” a source tells People. “She really wants to work things out with Ben. They are giving things another try.”

An insider close to the situation adds, “There is always a chance of reconciliation. They love each other. They also really, really love their kids, and those kids love their parents.”
Affleck and Garner, both 44, are trying to make their marriage work after allegedly hitting a rough patch in their relationship, where the latter was supposedly “telling friends that she plans on filing for divorce.”
“Ben is making a big effort to take care of himself. They are not back together, but there seems to be hope,” a source says. “Jen is hoping they can stay married. Ben doesn’t want a divorce either.”
Entertainment Tonight reports a different story. According to sources close to the couple, “there is no update or change in Ben and Jen’s relationship” since their split two years ago.
“Everything is moving at same pace it has been since their separation was announced,” one source tells ET. “They have always remained civil and they are doing this at the pace they need to do for the best interest of their family. No specific event occurred or changed their relationship. It’s the exact same status.”
The duo’s three children include daughters Violet, 11, and Seraphina, 8, and son Samuel, 5.

Calling All Angels! Sickly Della Reese Admits: 'My Life Is At Stake'/n
Showbiz icon Della Reese has been forced to use a wheelchair to get around after being ravaged by diabetes and TWO brain operations, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
Now fans are praying for the legendary songbird and star of TV’s family hit show, Touched by an Angel, who needed surgery to avoid becoming a vegetable.
A top medical expert told Radar that Reese’s weakened condition is likely due to high blood sugar issues, which often lead to nerve and brain damage.

The 85-year-old actress’ shocking appearance stunned fans when she turned up to honor her Angel co-star Roma Downey, who received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last month.
“She was barely recognizable,” claimed an onlooker. “She’s clearly deteriorated a lot in the last few years.”

“She looks horrible,” he said. “She obviously is in a wheelchair and she probably has all kinds of cell damage including to her arteries and her brain and everything else from the high blood sugar.”
“She probably has some central nervous system brain damage.”
Reese was diagnosed with diabetes in 2000 after she collapsed on the Angel set. She admitted her old, nightly snacks of fried chicken, potato chips, ice cream, candy bars and cola were the cause.

Earlier, in 1979, she suffered a brain aneurysm and needed two operations to survive.
Her docs told her, “Even if an operation were successful, I could have ended up a vegetable,” she revealed.
Della’s rep Lynda Bensky insisted the star isn’t “wheelchair-bound,” but admits “she has been in and out of one for years … as she gets older she doesn’t walk that far.”

Paula Patton Claims Robin Thicke Took Their Social Worker Out to Dinner/n
The custody battle between Paula Patton and Robin Thicke is getting messier.

According to new documents filed by Patton’s legal team, the actress is accusing of her ex of wining and dining a case worker from the Department of Children and Family Services, taking the supervisor out on an “expensive sushi dinner” at Nobu when the staffer was supposed to be watching their son, Julian, during a monitored visit.
TMZ reports:
According to the docs … Paula’s also accusing Robin of falsely reporting to law enforcement she had kidnapped Julian. She says Robin tampered with the custody order to make it look like she was kidnapping their son.
Paula thinks Robin was trying to embarrass and humiliate her by having cops arrest her in front of Julian.

On August 11, 1997, a new daytime, women-fronted talk show called The View debuted and the landscape of daytime TV was forever changed.At its outset, five opinionated women (some well-known and some under-the-radar) helmed the show and chatted about taboo topics and hot-button issues in front of a live studio office. Barbara Walters, Joy Behar, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones and Debbie Matenopoulos were the first ladies at bat (or at chat, really) on the revolutionary program that's still making headlines.Some of the women, like Whoopi Goldberg, have lasted more than a decade, while others, like Raven-Symoné (and many more), were one-season wonders. Meanwhile, Behar bid farewell to the gig in 2013 after being on the show for six years, only to come back in 2015.An amazing 20 years later, the view of The View is looking rather different than it did two decades ago (save for the presence of Behar)— the show's other four co-hosts are Paula Faris, Sara Haines, Jedediah Bila and Sunny Hostin.In honor of tomorrow's 20th anniversary of the trail-blazing show, check out all plethora of women who have said goodbye to their co-hosting gig (BTW: some left without a fond—or any—farewell) and changed what it means to, "take a little time and enjoy the view"...

This Teen Is Making Celebs Like Frank Ocean Fall In Love With Her Powerful T-Shirt Designs
/n
Starting a successful business at the age of 18 would be difficult for many, but it wasn’t for Kayla Robinson—owner of the Green Box Shop, which makes statement tees—thanks to one spotlight moment. Just when the teenager’s enterprise was running low on cash, Frank Ocean wore one that reads, “Why Be Racist, Sexist, Homophobic, or Transphobic When You Could Just Be Quiet” at the Panorama Music Festival last month in New York City. Suddenly legions of fans were clamoring to get their hands on one.
“It was a surreal moment. Before that, my business was really struggling,” Robinson tells People Chica. “So I knew it was finally going to be okay.”

Her collection of tees make bold political statements, such as “Pizza Rolls Not Gender Roles” and “Climate Change is Real. Trump Is A Hoax,” which she promotes and sells on her website.
Her ideas often come from a personal place, but she also finds inspiration from her followers, who share their social struggles with her. “‘[Being] a bisexual, feminine Afro-Latina, I understand certain stigmas firsthand so I create those designs from that perspective. For subjects that are outside of my identity—including issues related to being disabled, other cultures, or transgender communities—I check in with my followers,” she explains.
Frank Ocean isn’t her only celebrity fan. Her apparel has also caught the attention of Zendaya, who once tweeted her plans to  buy all of Robinson’s shirts, and Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui Instagrammed a photo of herself wearing the same one Ocean made famous.

What other celebs would she like to see donning her duds? Kehlani, whom she calls her biggest inspiration. The singer’s album “Sweet, Sexy, Savage,” she say, lifted her spirits and encouraged her to persist when her business was lagging.
While Robinson strives to build a strong foundation for her brand—which has gone from 20 to 200 sales daily—she also wants to stick to her mission of raising money to educate the public about homegrown food and sustainability. “Unfortunately, in America,” she says, “there are 23.5 million people who live in low-income areas that are more than one mile from a supermarket. “This means,” she continues “that fresh and healthy food is not accessible. I would like to teach and empower these communities to be able to sustain themselves through personal gardens.”

What was once a struggling business for a young teen became an overnight success. “I simply want this to continue to be a platform in which we can empower each other to be strong and to be heard,” she says.
Now, when you visit the shop’s website, it reads: “Due to the recent influx, order processing time has been delayed.”

Chester Bennington Mural Stops Traffic on the 101 Freeway in L.A./n
If you're stuck in traffic trying to get on the 101 freeway in Los Angeles, you may be able to take a few moments to gaze upon a familiar face.A 20-foot mural of Chester Bennington, Linkin Park's frontman who died at age 41 last month, has been painted on the back of the new Sherman Oaks branch of the rock-themed pizza restaurant Rock'n Pies. The artwork is visible from the on-ramp to the typically clogged northbound section of the 101 freeway on Coldwater Canyon Avenue, south of Riverside Drive."I'd been seeing that big blank wall from the 101 and thought it would be good for something," artist Jonas Never told Variety in comments posted Tuesday. "When I heard Chester died, I immediately thought of that wall because I knew some of the band members lived in the Valley. I just texted Jim and offered to do it for free because it was the right thing to do.""I was leaving the kitchen last night at 11:30, and I was greeted by flashing lights, people taking pictures," Rock'n Pies owner Jim Conners told the outlet. "When Jonas was working on it, everyone in their cars on the 101 were beeping their horns and cheering him on. It was pretty cool. Now there's something to look at while you're stuck in traffic."

The mural shows Chester shirtless and smiling."I stumbled across this publicity still of him, smiling, very recognizable, with all his tattoos visible," Never said. "I thought it would be better than having him up there screaming."

"We are honored to have such an amazing tribute to Chester on the wall of our building, and overwhelmed by the response from fans in the local community and all over the world," read one post. "Thanks again @never1959, @_kryst_ and @mr_kub_ . Thank you @kroq for acknowledging this incredible artwork. And thank you, Chester for all the art you've produced over the years."

Barry Manilow Covers Hits From the 60s/nBy RON BERTHEL, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS You have to admire Barry Manilow's courage.  Making an album of 14 covers of pop classics that have endured  for 50 years and risking comparison with their beloved -- even  sacred -- original versions takes plenty of guts.  And Manilow's renditions aren't bad.  The problem is that most of these songs will always belong to  their original owners.  One original owner is present: Phyllis McGuire joins Manilow on  a medley of two hits she had with the McGuire Sisters,  "Sincerely" and "Teach Me Tonight," and still sounds pretty  good, even after 50 years.  And Manilow's arrangement of "Beyond the Sea" as a ballad  rather than as Bobby Darin's hip, upbeat, finger-snapper restores  the poignancy and beauty of this song about a soldier yearning to  be reunited with his beloved.  But let it be said that "It's Not for Me To Say" need not be  sung by anyone but Johnny Mathis. The same is true for "Venus"  and Frankie Avalon, "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" and Elvis, and so  on.  And although Manilow hardly embarrasses himself on "Unchained  Melody," this song simply doesn't sound right in the hands of  anyone but the Righteous Brothers (whose definitive version, by the  way, was released in 1965, 10 years after the song was introduced  by Al Hibbler).  Manilow's voice still has the pleasant, friendly sound that  helped him pump out all those hits in the 1970s and 80s. On this  album, though, he sometimes seems to be too concerned with his  enunciation.  This is a top-notch playlist, and these songs are always good to  hear -- even if doing so makes us long for the real thing./n

What If Diana Had Lived? 20 Years Since Fatal Crash/n
It’s been 20 years since Princess Diana died after a car crash in Paris — but what if she had survived?
In a RadarOnline Report, insiders reveal what the beauty — who would have been 56 on July 1 — would look like today and the path her life probably would have taken.
“Diana would be one of the most powerful women on the planet — but haunted by the crash that killed Dodi Fayed,” says a longtime friend.
“Just a year after divorcing Prince Charles, she’d have been a pregnant widow.
PHOTOS: The Royal Family Revealed: Secrets William, Kate & Harry Don’t Want You To Know
“Plagued by nightmares about the crash, only the birth of her child — a longed-for daughter in the spring of 1998 — would pull her out of her emotional tailspin.
“Her sons, Princes William and Harry, were away at school, so she’d seldom see them.”
Today, Diana would be living in America, with her daughter in college.
PHOTOS: Other Royals Caught With Their Clothes Off!
“She wanted to live half in Los Angeles or New York and half in England,” says royal author Nicholas Davies.
“She had extraordinary appeal and would have become best friends with politicians, even presidents, and celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie, who [shares the late] Diana’s passion for helping the sick, poor and hungry.
“I could even see her performing on ‘Dancing with the Stars‘ to help promote charities dear to her heart.”
Not to mention starring in a movie of her own — and having a house in Hollywood too!
PHOTOS: The Sexiest Young Royals
Diana would have remained extremely close to her sons.
“She would have insisted on being a major part of their lives,” says Davies. “She’d have adored William’s wife, Kate, but she’d be worried Harry still hadn’t settled down!”
But his actress girlfriend, Meghan Markle, would get Diana’s seal of approval, say pals.
Diana’s priority now would be her grandchildren, Prince George, 3, and Princess Charlotte, 2.
PHOTOS: The 10 Most Eligible Royal Bachelorettes
“Diana would’ve been a fantastic grandmother,” says her friend Julia Samuel. “She was warm, loving and fun. Someone who gave children the presents they loved but the parents didn’t want them to have because they were so huge or noisy!”

Despite her scandal-ridden 1996 divorce from Charles, Diana would be close to Queen Elizabeth.
“Her Majesty thought Diana was a misfit, but she’s confessed that Diana saved the monarchy with her sons,” says an insider.
PHOTOS: Queen Of The House! Kate Middleton’s Super Strict Parenting Rules Exposed
Diana, however, would never have forgiven Camilla Parker Bowles for stealing her husband.
“And that would have made it difficult for Charles to marry Camilla,” says author Christopher Wilson.
“Diana had the power, and the love of the people, to stop that marriage from ever happening.”
PHOTOS: Never Forgotten! Princess Kate Makes Touching Tribute To Diana At Royal Event
The princess would have worked hard to keep her looks, too.
“She’d have taken advantage of Botox, fillers and other cosmetic procedures,” says Davies. “But I don’t think she’d have had a face-lift.
“Her hair would be longer too.”
PHOTOS: Prince Harry’s Girlfriend Goes Back To Work After Nude Photo Scandal
Sadly, Diana would still be seeking true love from someone kind, rich enough to afford her and strong enough to handle her insecurities.
“She’d have had many lovers and even married once or twice, but she was scary possessive,” says the insider.
“No man wanted to be ‘Mr. Diana.'”

Melania Trump’s Sad Face Is the Meme We Didn’t Know We Needed/n





                    The Face Michelle Obama Made When Melania Trump Gave Her a Parting Gift Was EVERYTHING
                







Meme alert!

Apparently, Michelle Obama’s side-eye wasn’t the only meme to have come out of President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Days after the former reality star was sworn into office, a video of his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, looking sad during the ceremony has taken the internet by storm. Originally tweeted out by user @Marv_Vien without comment, the short clip shows the FLOTUS beaming when she talks to her husband before her face drops to a sullen expression after he turns his back to her.

The GIF follows many people’s concerns that Melania “doesn’t seem happy at all” when she’s with her husband. Some argue that she seems distance towards to POTUS in comparison to the chemistry the Obamas share as a couple.

 Mommy Dearest! Joan Rivers & Daughter Melissa's Secret Feud Exposed In New Tell-All.../n
Joan Rivers and her constant red carpet companion, daughter Melissa, seemed more like sisters before the superstar’s shocking death in 2014. But according to a shocking new tell-all obtained by RadarOnline.com, the comedienne battled with her only child from the time the younger Rivers was a girl.
The bitterness began after the suicide death of Joan’s husband and Melissa’s father, Edgar Rosenberg, in 1987, when the current Fashion Police cohost was just a teenager.
“Melissa blamed Joan for her father’s suicide,” Joan’s confidante Sue Cameron told author Leslie Bennetts in Last Girl Before Freeway: The Life, Lives, Losses and Liberation Of Joan Rivers.
PHOTOS: Kelly Osbourne Leaves ‘Fashion Police’ — New Details In Photos
“They did discuss divorce before Edgar’s suicide, and that’s why Melissa got so angry with her mother. She felt her mother was just throwing her father away completely…He couldn’t think of a way out.”
After recovering from Edgar’s painful, tragic death, the mother/daughter bond was again tested when Joan allegedly forced Melissa, now 48, to undergo plastic surgery.
“She made her have her nose done,” Cameron told Bennetts in the book. (Of course, Joan wasn’t shy about her own nips and tucks during her lifetime.)

But by Joan’s sudden death at 81 from a throat surgery complication, any animosity had melted away.
Melissa and her son Cooper were at the legend’s bedside when she took her last breath.
“After a few hours, she was finally gone. I didn’t have to tell her I loved her. She knew. She didn’t have to tell me she loved me. I knew,” Melissa wrote in The Book of Joan: Tales of Mirth, Mischief, and Manipulation.

In fact, opening up for the first time since news broke that Kutcher and Mila Kunis were pregnant, Willis couldn’t help but gush about his 1-month-old baby girl.

While the 26-year-old has yet to meet her former step-dad’s little one, she’s already seen lots of pictures.
“I reached out to him when he had the baby, which is so awesome,” Rumer said during a recent appearance on Access Hollywood Live.  “I saw photos of [Wyatt].  she’s very cute!”

Meanwhile, the actress and singer also opened up about Kutcher’s relationship with her mother Demi Moore, realizing how young the Two and a Half Men star was when he joined her big family.
“I realized the other day, that he was a year younger than me when he and my mom started going out,” she revealed, chatting about a then-25-year-old Ashton, who started dating Moore, 40, in 2003.  “That would be like me meeting someone who already had three teenage kids, kind of going into that situation was crazy.”
She continues, “My mom has always made how [my sisters and I] feel about situations the most important thing.  I think it was more her going, ‘Hey, this is my life and these are my kids and my priorities. So if you want to come and kind of join our crazy clan, this is what I already have kind of built.’ Which I find so amazing and respectful. It’s one of the things that I admire most about my parents, is that they set such an incredible example for kind of putting their children first and keeping a family together, no matter what.”

 The spirit of Father’s Day is going strong all over Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. And Ciara, not wanting to be left out of the fun, shared the very first photo of her adorable baby boy.
This baby is the cutest (and coolest) celebrity child we’ve seen all day.

Ciara, who just gave birth to little Future Zahir Wilburn a month ago, revealed the picture Sunday morning via Instagram.

He is rather obviously named after the 28-year-old’s partner, rapper and fiancé Future.
In another pic posted earlier, the little guy can be seen holding onto his father’s hand.

Robert Blake's Girlfriend Warned Before Wedding: 'Get Out Before It's Too Late'/n
Robert Blake plans to say ‘I do’ for the third time —16 years after he went to trial for his second wife’s murder.
Now, the ex of Blake’s bride-to-be is offering some advice on what he hopes is not a doomed union.
“She’s a very smart person so if anything is going on, or [if there are] any issues, she’ll know to get out before it’s too late,” said Richard Hendershot, who broke up with the future Mrs. Blake in February 2016.
“Hopefully she’s making the right decision.”

It was reported that the 83-year-old actor was at the Beverly Hills Courthouse on Thursday, filling out a marriage license alongside his flame-haired lady love, Pamela Hudak.
“It’s shocking that she’s getting married so quickly, but not that they are getting married,” added Hendershot, who knew Hudak had dated the Baretta star.
Blake’s first wife was Sondra Blake, who was married to the TV icon from 1960 to 1982.
This is Hudak’s first marriage, according to her ex.

“Robert and Pamela have been on and off for a long time. But his name never came up during our relationship,” said Hendershot.
“She saw him a couple times when we were together. But it wasn’t romantic, at least I didn’t think it was.”
According to Hudak’s Facebook profile, the Sherman Oaks, Calif. resident studied theatre in her home state of Minnesota and now works as a marketing specialist.
Hendershot said his 55-year-old ex-girlfriend met the hot-headed actor as a struggling actress when she was a stand-in for Geena Davis.

But she always kept her relationship with the troubled star a secret.
“Robert was never an issue in our relationship. She didn’t talk about him,” he said. “She’s a good, decent person, but I don’t know what prompted the reconciliation.
“I wish her happiness.”
Maybe this is the Little Rascals star’s chance at happiness too, since Radar reported he secretly lived on the dark side for years after his wife Bonnie Lee Bakley‘s death in a creepy house of horrors, complete with walls and ceilings painted black.
Blake was 68 when 44-year-old Bakley was gunned down on May 4, 2001, as she sat in their car outside a Studio City, Calif. restaurant. He was tried for her murder and acquitted in 2005. But Blake was later found liable for her death in a civil suit and ordered today $15 million to her kids, forcing him to file for bankruptcy.
The actor was first spotted in Los Angeles walking arm-in-arm with a mystery redhead in 2016 who looks similar to Hudak, but at the time Blake insisted she was simply his nurse.

2 Live Crew's Fresh Kid Ice Dead/nFresh Kid Ice -- founding member of 2 Live Crew, and a pioneer for Asian rappers, died in Miami ... TMZ has learned.

According to the group's manager he died at 7:50 AM Thursday in a Miami hospital ... due to a medical condition. Fresh Kid's real name was Chris Wong Won ... and he and the group became poster children for First Amendment Rights after their  "As Nasty As They Wanna Be " album was the first to be labeled legally obscene by the government.

Exposed: Oprah Winfrey's LIES Over Snubbed 'Secret Son'/n
Oprah Winfrey has been caught spinning the truth about her “secret son” after RadarOnline.com reported their recent heartbreaking reunion.
The TV titan confessed to Entertainment Tonight that she became devoted to Calvin Mitchell in the ’90s when he was just 11 and approached her on a Chicago movie set.
But, as Radar reported, Oprah tried to adopt Mitchell and provide him with a private school education away from his real family, but he became homesick and left the school she was paying for him to attend. She then coldly abandoned him when he failed to live up to her high standards.
PHOTOS: Inside Oprah’s Sad Reunion With Boy She Was Once Desperate To Adopt
In the Oct. 29 interview with ET, Oprah said she decided against meeting with Mitchell, now 35, because Radar had arranged their reunion outside a New York City theater on Oct. 15.
Oprah, 61, conveniently failed to tell ET that she’s repeatedly brushed Mitchell off over the years. Back in 2009, the Illinois truck driver managed to approach Oprah when she sponsored a free concert along Chicago’s Michigan Ave.
After he slipped through security, Oprah told Mitchell to give his phone number to one of her bodyguards. He did, but Oprah never called him.

Mitchell left repeated messages for the talk show queen at her Harpo Studios, but she continued to snub him.
Out of desperation, Mitchell came to Radar, hoping to ask Oprah why she severed ties with him when he was just 17.
“The only reason I went to the media was because it was the only way I could get her attention,” the father of two admitted to Radar.
“I wanted to ask Oprah, ‘Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me?'”
In another heartbreak for tragic Mitchell, Oprah’s father, Vernon Winfrey, has also shunned his “secret grandson.”
“I’m all right if I don’t meet him,” the elder Winfrey told Radar. “It doesn’t matter!” /n

John Legend’s Darkness and Light, Childish Gambino’s Awaken, My Love!, and the highly-anticipated Hamilton Mixtape have all dropped.
Just when you thought your weekend might be boring, the three albums were released on Friday (Dec. 2, 2016) for your listening pleasure. Legend, who recently debuted the music video for “Love Me Now,” finally released his fifth studio album.


Biggest Selling Albums of 2015

It features guest collaborations from Chance the Rapper and Miguel — and is meant to help people heal following this year’s election. “When we were thinking about when my album was going to come out, we had no expectation that we’d be reacting to a Donald Trump presidency,” the singer told Entertainment Weekly. “Now that it’s the case, I feel like this album could help people heal a little bit after some tough times.”
John Legend’s Darkness and Light is out now. Stream it below.

Donald Glover also released new music, his third full-length album as Childish Gambino. Unlike  previously released tracks, this album features soul/funk/R&B grooves over his usual hip-hop. Childish Gambino’s Awaken, My Love! is out now. Stream it below.

Last but not least, The Hamilton Mixtape is finally here. Not only does it feature covers from at least a dozen artists you know by name — including Queen Latifah, Kelly Clarkson, Ashanti, Wiz Khalifa, and Alicia Keys — but the album also includes never-before-heard tracks that were cut from the Broadway musical, Hamilton.
The Hamilton Mixtape is out now. Stream it below.

James Cameron Sued by Man Claiming Leo's 'Titanic' Character Based On Him/nJames Cameron stole the life story of a Florida man who worked in the yacht industry and used it for the lead character of  "Titanic " ... according to his lawsuit. Stephen Cummings claims he's the inspiration for Jack Dawson -- played by Leo DiCaprio. According to the docs, Cameron learned about Cummings through word of mouth about events that took place in Brevard County in 1988 and '89. If this seems unlikely ... wait. The ex- "yacht master " also says the depiction of the Titanic sinking was NOT based on history, but instead on stories he told friends about 2 of his relatives who were aboard the real doomed ship. You probably guessed -- the wife survived, the husband did not. Of course, 1,517 souls were lost that fateful 1912 night ... so we'd imagine there are more than a few such stories. In any event, Cummings wants $300 million ... plus 1 percent of royalties./n

Miley Cyrus misses her beloved blowfish Pablow — so much so that she wrote him a song. 
On Monday (May 18, 2015), Cyrus posted a video where she shared her track written in honor of her late pet. In a unicorn onesie, the 22-year-old sat solemnly at a keyboard for the song, which is part of her Backyard Sessions. She can barely get through the song before breaking down into tears. Actual tears.

“Some of you may remember a few months ago my dear blow fish Pablow past away,” she wrote on her Facebook page. “I wrote this song for him…He made me so happy and I miss him everyday…. But now he is with Floyd and Melanie’s sweet Sadie”
While the singer’s voice sounds beautiful in the clip, the lyrics are pretty insane.
On Saturday night we all went out to eat
But I can never decide so someone chose sushi
I got soup and I ordered rice
But watching my friends eat my friend ruined my appetite
Oh Pablow the Blowfish if they only knew you like I do they’d love you too
And Pablow the Blowfish I miss you so bad
I won’t forget even one second we had
Cause you might be gone but you could never be dead



I hate goodbyes

Mel B Ordered to Pay Stephen Belafonte $40k a Month in Spousal Support/nMel B's bank account is gonna take a painful hit -- at least for now -- because she's been ordered to pay her estranged husband $40,000 a month. Stephen Belafonte's request for emergency spousal support was granted by a judge who agrees ... he needs help paying for food, housing and his phone, among other things. It could have been worse for Mel. According to docs, she could have been forced to pay $15k more per month -- based on income and expenses -- but the judge cut her a break. The order also includes a one-time payment of $140,000 for Stephen's legal fees. So, Mel will have to cut a check for that, plus $40k monthly, until both sides work out their final divorce settlement. As we reported ... Mel argued last month that Stephen's financial requests were ridiculous and he needed to get a job. Looks like he can afford to be picky about work ... for a while at least./n
Camilla Belle Debuts Gorgeous Bob Haircut Another day, another bob! Camilla Belle is the latest celebrity to embrace the big chop. Looking effortlessly chic in a CH Carolina Herrera blouse and lace skirt combo, the actress debuted her shorte.../n
Another day, another bob!Camilla Belle is the latest celebrity to embrace the big chop. Looking effortlessly chic in a CH Carolina Herrera blouse and lace skirt combo, the actress debuted her shorter ‘do at the brand's boutique opening in Los Angeles.Also at last night's fashion fete (cohosted by Vanity Fair) were A-listers Angie Harmon, Molly Sims, Rashida Jones and Ali Larter and Amy Adams.

It is hard to tell when Belle actually got her haircut, as last night was her first red carpet event since March.Mind you, the actress has been busy filming Amapola. She also was working on Love Is All You Need with Twilight hunk, Kellan Lutz.What is clear is that the star lobbed quite a few inches. Before her new crop the actress had been rocking extra long sleek lock—falling far past her shoulders—for the past few years.

The chin-length style is similar to the textured bobs currently being sported by Jennifer Lawrence and Karlie Kloss, which was named Haircut of the Year by Vogue.Despite being just one of many celebs to opt for the bob this year, Belle knew just how to let her new hairstyle steal the spotlight. The 26-year-old complemented the curly crop with a dash of pink eye shadow, matching petal lipstick and mascara. As for accessories, a simple navy clutch and coral Christian Louboutin peep toes kept her look minimalistic.

Her gorgeous cut comes just days after Milla Jovovich returned to a similar ‘do, and only a week after Jaime Pressly tweeted a pic of her sleek bob.At the rate Hollywood is going there might not be any long haircuts left on the red carpet.

You Can Rock Colored Sheets! Celeb Designers Estee Stanley and Brigette Romanek Are Here to Help/n
Brights were everywhere this year, even in your breakfast (hi, rainbow bagels). Now, even your bed sheets can get in on the action! You heard it here first: 2017 is going to be the year we all get a little more adventurous in the bedroom.
Luxury bedding company Flaneur offers customers the ability to create custom-dyed sheets (check out their insanely cool Pantone color map), and they recently tapped celebrity interior designers Estee Stanley and Brigette Romanek to create unique looks to get everyone excited about mixing and matching colors. “I think the bed is becoming a place where people are more interested in design,” Romanek tells PEOPLE. “It used to be that you put on your sheets and went to bed. Now it’s become another place to express yourself.”  Says Stanley, “You spend a lot of time in your bed—You should love it!”
“I’m used to seeing white all the time, because that’s what a lot of my clients like, but I was surprised that even I really loved it,” Stanley, who decorated Lea Michele’s chic L.A. home, says.
“We did this one bohemian kind of look that had like a really beautiful pink, mustard and a bright blue. The pillows we did were a pink and a mustard, and the duvet was the blue and the flat sheets were pink,” she says. “It sounds kind of crazy, but it’s really beautiful. It’s very sophisticated in a way that’s accessible and enjoyable—I think these colors would make you feel good and up your mood.”
Courtesy Flaneur
“One of our favorites was a soft yellow with a muted sort of orange, and merlot color on the bottom. That combination was just spectacular,” says Romanek. “That combination of orange and the yellow and the deep red was extremely elegant, warm and pretty. With some pink flowers on the side of your bed with those colors, it’s amazing.”
If these combos seem a little daunting, the designers shared their best advice for color newbies:

Try just one accent sheet. Think of it as your “gateway” to color. “Just get a flat sheet!” says Stanley. “It’s a good way to start without spending a lot of money on bedding. Your base can be your whites and that’s what you have and getting different flat sheets and pillow cases and experiment to see what you like.”
Mixing neutrals is just as exciting as adding a pop of color. “Dusty palettes are very elegant,” says Romanek. If your room has colored walls, Romanek suggests a mix of grays or khakis. “A little blush pink would be great in a dusty blue room.”
Don’t fear bold hues, but pair them with a complementary neutral. Certain colors are more daring (read: scary) than others, but it’s all about having a light hand. Even red, which could give off a Playboy Mansion vibe, is doable.  “Try a deep, deep red and everything else in more muted colors, like a khaki,” says Stanley.  “Rather than a huge, bright red comforter, think about doing just a flat sheet and some pillows so that the color is more like an accent than the main part of the bed.”

Rihanna has no time for haters.

The singer was pretty in pink at the world premiere of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets premiere in Los Angeles Monday night (July 17th). Clad in blush Giambattista Valli couture gown with its own train, the 29-year-old stopped traffic — literally — as she sashayed down the red carpet.
She accessorized her look with a matching clutch, lace-up heels, and rosy jewelry.

But in case you had negative things to say about the internet’s favorite Bad Gal, Rihanna recently let a fan know she won’t be disrespected by blocking her on Twitter. When one woman commented, “Rihanna would look so much more beautiful if she was white,” alongside photos that were digitally altered to lighten Rih’s skin color, the songstress shut her TF down with one simple click.

Leigh-Allyn Baker on Why a Gluten-Free Diet Has Been Crucial for Her Sons: 'Heal the Gut, Heal the Brain'
/n

 
Will & Grace alum and Good Luck Charlie star Leigh-Allyn Baker opens up about motherhood and her son’s daily battle with dyspraxia in an exclusive five-part PEOPLE series. (Read part 1 here, part 2 here, part 3 here and part 4 here.)
You won’t find any gluten in Leigh-Allyn Baker‘s home — but don’t call it a “junk”-free space.
“They don’t eat chemical junk, but they still get to eat junk — they just eat natural junk,” Baker tells PEOPLE of her and husband Keith Kauffman‘s two sons: Baker James, 4½, and Griffin Samuel, 8.

“When there’s a birthday party, my kids get a cake, they just get one without gluten, soy and dairy, and without artificial colors,” she adds.

Baker – whose older son Griffin has the developmental disorder dyspraxia – says that her family’s gluten-, dairy-, soy- and artificial-color-free diet has been “really important” to keeping her kids healthy.
“Scientists know, doctors know: Heal the gut, heal the brain,” says the Good Luck Charlie actress. “And so I want to create the best atmosphere possible for neurons to fire in his brain. So, to do that, I heal his gut.”
The star says that the diet has had positive results with Griffin and Baker, explaining, “It’s been evident in the blood work.”

Additionally, little Baker – whom the actress previously revealed suffers from speech issues – has celiac disease. In fact, when she removed gluten from her younger child’s diet, his nearly year-long struggle to speak ended.
“That’s how important it is to the brain,” Baker says. “They do not eat any artificial dyes or food coloring. We happen to be very reactive to that. A rash will appear all over our body. It’s not just hyperactivity or bad behavior or memory loss that’s incurred on the body.”
Baker is opening up more about how dyspraxia has affected her family in a Thursday Facebook Live chat with Dyspraxia Foundation USA, starting at 7:30 p.m. EST.

Gilbert Arenas Sues Ex-Manager for $40 MILLION!/nThe man Gilbert Arenas paid to watch over his NBA fortune, ended up helping the former NBA superstar's assistant rob him blind ... according to a massive lawsuit Gilbert just filed.  Gilbert is gunning for Lester Knispel and Boulevard Management ... the company he says he hired in 2006 to control his cash flow, of which he had plenty. You'll recall, Arenas signed a $111 million contract with the Washington Wizards in 2008.In the docs, obtained by TMZ Sports ... Gilbert says Boulevard approved millions of dollars worth of wire transfers made by his former assistant John White. Arenas says the transfers -- made between 2007 and 2013 -- moved  "large and irregular " amounts of cash from one account to another ... which White controlled. White was convicted in September for fraud related to those wire transfers -- but in his suit, Arenas says Boulevard should shoulder some blame too, since he was paying them to monitor his money.  Arenas also says Boulevard grossly overcharged him -- $2.25 million -- for services rendered.    Boulevard's a big deal in Hollywood ... it's also repped Shaq, the Kardashians, Rod Stewart, the Eagles, Barbra Streisand and Russell Brand. Gilbert's not impressed. He wants at least $40 million in damages. We've reached out to Boulevard Management, but no word back yet./n

It’s On! Kim Kardashian & Beyonce's Catfight Turns Nastier Than Ever/n
The claws are out between Kim Kardashian and Beyonce, and it’s about to get nasty.
Kardashian, 36, is furious over the fact that the 35-year-old Lemonade singer ignored her baby gift that she meant as an olive branch.
An insider told RadarOnline.com: “Kim sent over a huge bouquet of flowers and a basket of baby gifts weeks ago, as soon as she heard about the twins’ birth.”

“But she’s had no word of thanks and she’s steaming mad, saying it’s the final straw and a huge insult she simply shouldn’t have to tolerate.”
“Kim insists it’s Beyonce’s who’s been the aggressor in their feud; she’s tried countless times to mend fences – including meeting up back in January – but the simple reality is that Bey considers Kim trash and beneath her.
“There’s still a lot of b****ing going on between these two, and Kanye’s beef with Jay-Z is only making it worse.”
The two women were civil at one time, but their relationship wasn’t helped by the fact that both of their husbands got embroiled in a messy legal battle.

Bill Cosby Trial: Cop Recounts Alleged Victim Andrea Constand's Rape Nightmare/n
UPDATE June 6, 12:45 pm et-
After arriving to the Pennsylvania courthouse without his wife and family, Bill Cosby and jurors heard the testimony of the star’s alleged victim Kelly Johnson‘s mother, Dr. Patrice Sewell.
Sewell told prosecutor Kristen Feden her daughter “changed considerably” after the TV comedian sexually assaulted her in 1996. The former Williams Morris Agency employee was diagnosed with clinical depression as a result of the attack, her mother insisted.
The next witness who took the stand was attorney Joseph Miller, who deposed Johnson after she filed a workers compensation case against William Morris.
Miller said Johnson cried “several times” during the deposition when recounting Cosby’s sexual assault.
As Johnson stated during yesterday’s testimony, Miller said she awoke from a pill-induced stupor to Cosby’s naked genitals.
Finally, the responding police officer to alleged victim Andrea Constand’s case gave his testimony.
On January 13, 2005, detective David Mason said Constand was “nervous” and embarrassed” as she recounted how Cosby gave her three blue bills at his home before sexually assaulting her.
Constand told the cop she had waited to file the report due to her humiliation, and the fact that she was a “high-profile” figure at Temple University.
UPDATE- June 5, 3:30
After opening statements, assistant district attorney Stewart Ryan called his first witness, alleged victim Kelly Johnson, to the stand.
A former William Morris employee, Johnson, 55, claimed she met Cosby in her office. By 1999, he was asking her to “run lines” with him in his home.
In one incident, Cosby allegedly gave her a “large white pill.”
“I wouldn’t give anything to hurt you, trust me, it will just make you relax,” she said the comedian told her. However, she soon felt “underwater.”
“I woke in the bedroom,” she recalled in an emotional testimony. “I was wearing a
dress, it was up over my waist and down past my breast and my breasts were exposed. He put lotion in my hand and put his penis in my hand.”
She said Cosby teamed up with her employer to get her fired.
UPDATE- June 5, 2 PM ET
Prosecutors claimed Monday afternoon that Bill Cosby was well aware of his misdeeds when he allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand in 2004, as the defense focused on Constand’s lack of credibility and potential missteps during time of the alleged incidents.
In her opening statement, Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden insisted to jury that the case isn’t about consent at all, claiming that when the comedian “handed those pills to Andrea he knew what affect it would take” and that she would be unable to accept his advances.
“Trust, betrayal, and the inability to consent. That’s what this case is about. . .This is a case about a man, this man,” Feden said of Cosby, arguing he “used his power and his fame and his previously practiced method of placing a young trusting woman in an incapacitated state so that he could sexually pleasure himself so that she couldn’t say no.”
Meanwhile, Defense Attorney Brian McMonagle claimed the case had been “exhaustively investigated” in the past, with Constand’s claims purportedly found to be “untruthful time and time and time again.”
“You’re going to find out that Andrea Constand changed her story,” McMonagle told jurors. “Promise me you will stand up and find this man not guilty.”
Cosby’s lawyer also said Constand accepted luxury gifts from the wealthy star, and even willingly laid in bed with him.

Bill Cosby‘s highly anticipated sexual assault trial kicked off this morning, June 6, in the Montgomery County Courthouse with helicopters flying overhead and high security surrounding the property — and Radar has all the exclusive details from inside the courtroom!

As readers know, former Temple University employee Andrea Constand alleged that the comedian drugged and molested her in 2004 at her suburban Philadelphia home.
More than 40 women have accused the 79-year-old of sexual assault thus far.

First Day of Trial:
According to Radar’s eyewitness, Cosby entered the courtroom, chatting and smiling with the council. But it didn’t go unnoticed that the seats reserved for the shamed comedian’s “team” remained empty for quite some time.
9:35 — The jury arrives.
9:39 — The jury is sworn in; Judge Steven T. O’Neill addresses their duties and charges (three counts of aggravated indecent assault).
9:46 — Judge O’Neill reminds jury that Cosby is presumed innocent regardless of being charged of a crime, and is to be presumed innocent throughout the duration of the trial.
9:51 — Judge O’Neill discusses note taking and memory recollection, explaining those not taking notes shouldn’t be intimated by those who do, as juror notes will be destroyed by the court immediately following a verdict.
10:00 — Citing the riot act, Judge O’Neill warns the jury not to speak to anyone about the case during the trial, not even one another: “You are sequestered and will move as one.”
10:25 — Judge O’Neill continues to address the jury, implying this will be a lengthy two-week trial process.
10:27 — Judge concludes address to the jury.

 Equal Hatred! Charlie Sheen's Vicious Rants Against Ex-Fiancée Over Health Crisis —.../n
First it was his own kids, now it’s his ex. RadarOnline.com has obtained a series of scathing texts messages Charlie Sheen sent his estranged ex-fiancée after he suffered a “terrifying” health scare.
“I need to get a couple things off my chest,” Sheen wrote Ross in late 2014. “This is not about a bunch of fancy words, this is about how I feel and is rooted in absolute truth. I find your behavior as of late to be incredibly selfish.”
As RadarOnline.com reported, Sheen, a longtime smoker, revealed his “terrifying” health scare late last year after he was diagnosed with — and beat — a pre-cancerous throat condition.

Sheen sent Ross the texts after she had visited him in Boston, where he was getting treated for his condition.
“When you got the text yesterday there was NOT ONE MENTION of how I was feeling,” complained Sheen, 50. “It was ALL ABOUT you and how this would affect you and how because some dead dooshbag [sic] I couldn’t give A F–K ABOUT, is so painfully gonna repeat itself. Thanks. Tons of confidence there.”
The Two And A Half Men actor seemed to be referencing someone from Ross’s past who had suffered cancer and passed away from the disease.

“It’s also about and how you wear all this cancer shit like some badge of false courage…THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU!!!! F–k!” blasted Sheen, adding, “You have not once asked me how I’m feeling through all this.”
Sheen then ripped into Ross because she “never once” sent him flowers in the hospital or because he had gifted her “a trip, a new car, a watch, money.”
“That sucks,” continued Sheen in his text rant. “The fact that NOTHING SHOWED up in BOSTON based on what I was there doing is f–king s–t city.”
Sheen warned Ross that she better get out of her “own selfish way real fast or it’s all gonna be gone in the blink of an eye.”
“You talk about how none of these whores appreciate me?” Sheen concluded. “Guess what…it ain’t much diff with you. Hope I’m clear. I need some space this am.”
The National ENQUIRER broke the news on Monday that Sheen has been HIV positive for the last four years.
In a recent lawsuit filed by ex-wife Denise Richards, it was also revealed that Sheen had been sending threatening messages to the former couple’s children as well.
In 2013, after a difficult holiday season fighting over the children, Sheen daughters — Sam, 11, and Lola, 10 — wrote letters to the their dad to express their feelings.
“I walked into the room during the call and heard Sheen screaming, calling Lola (then nine years old) a ‘fucking pig whore,’ and yelling ‘I’m going to kill you and your mom.’ I told Lola to hang up, as she was visibly shaken and upset,” Denise claimed in court documents. “Sheen called back repeating the comments to me and yelling, ‘how dare you let them write these letters.’ He then said he was coming over to the house with a baseball bat and the conversation ended. I immediately contacted Sheen’s security, warning them I would call the police if they let Sheen come to the Clerendon residence. After this incident I hired private security for me and our children.” /n
Tragedy To Triumph: Burn Victim Mom Courtney Waldon Finds Love After Heartbreak/n
Courtney Waldon is making a comeback after her worst year ever. Less than a year after she was disfigured in a horrific fire and her husband moved out, the mother to 5-year old Caroline has found love again, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
“She has found someone,” Waldon’s father, Scott Cosper told Radar. “They’ve known each other since high school, but they met through the church that is building her a house.”
On her Instagram account, the 27-year-old proudly posted a photo with her new man.





A post shared by Courtney Waldon (@waldoncourtney) on Jul 13, 2017 at 7:48pm PDT



According to Cosper, Waldon and her new boyfriend have been dating for about a month and half.
“But she is still not legally divorced.” Cosper admitted. “So I don’t know what they’ll do until she is.”
The Georgia native infamously suffered fourth degree burns to her face and 40 percent of her body after a campfire accident last fall. Two weeks later, she claims her husband took off, and the couple soon divorced.

Her estranged husband, Mitch Cobb, who was also injured in the incident, told Radar that it was not his decision to leave Courtney, but that she called for the split.
“I was there with her night and day, and she was angry with the world, and it spiraled out of control,” Cobb said in an interview with Radar.
“My life has been a whirlwind for the past year. It’s just hard to mentally process all of it. I lose sleep over this every night, the sight, the smells, I can still feel the burns, its hard to sleep at night.”

When Mollie Wilmot's Ship Came In, It Really Came In—and Stayed and Stayed and Stayed/n
There is no particularly good time to have a 230-foot ship sail into your backyard, but the Venezuelan freighter Mercedes I picked an altogether inappropriate moment to crash through a seawall and park itself within feet of the lovely swimming pool behind Mollie Wilmot’s Palm Beach, Fla. mansion. After all, photographers were scheduled to arrive that weekend in November to record the charm and beauty of the place (which sits right next to the Kennedy home) for a spread in Town & Country magazine. But it was a dark and stormy night and the ship’s engines failed and it just sort of drifted in with the tide. “The maid woke me at 9:30 that morning and said there was a boat outside,” Wilmot recalls. “It was awesome. When I saw it, I could not speak.”
Once the shock wore off, Mrs. Wilmot, 58, a thrice-divorced department-store heiress with homes in Palm Beach, New York and Saratoga, exhibited true class: She took the Picasso painting off the wall for safekeeping, unfurled a clear plastic runway over the plush white carpeting in the living room and then brewed some coffee for the ship’s captain and his 12 crew members. In fact, she fed them—and their pet cat, Mercedes II—for the next 10 days, until they flew home to Venezuela, leaving the ship still beached in Wilmot’s backyard.
Which is where it remains, much to Wilmot’s chagrin, while various bureaucracies play a classic game of pass the buck. Distribuidora Naviera Del Caribe, the Venezuelan company that is said to own the ship, is broke, and the Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers say they are not responsible. So does the town of Palm Beach. For a while it looked as if nobody was going to remove the vessel, and Wilmot was so concerned that she hired Roy Cohn, who is quite possibly the world’s pushiest lawyer, to press her cause. But before Cohn could fire his big legal guns, the Florida Department of Natural Resources announced that it will pay a New Jersey salvage company $223,000 to remove the freighter later this month.
Meanwhile the residents of Palm Beach have rallied to Wilmot’s side by doing what they do best: They dropped by to sip cocktails, study the ship and offer tongue-in-cheek suggestions about what she ought to do with it. Among the brilliant ideas: hold exercise classes in the cabin, open a restaurant or start a disco on the deck. Added one bemused neighbor: “How clever of you to arrange this whole thing for our entertainment.”
Wilmot is not quite as philosophical about the whole affair as her neighbors. “That boat could literally come in my house!” she shrieks. “This is just like Star Wars. It’s devastating.” But in calmer moments, she too can ponder the strange vagaries of the tides. “There’s a strong possibility that if the boat had washed up on the Kennedy property,” she says, “it would be gone already.”

'MAFS's Jamie Otis Reveals Son's Name & Struggle Coping With Miscarriage/n
Jamie Otis is having a hard time coping with her son’s miscarriage. Only days after announcing the loss of her first child with husband Doug Hehner, the Married at First Sight star revealed how she has been unable to move on from the nightmare.
“Last night my husband and I were making dinner and I just lost it,” Otis wrote on her blog. “To think that a week ago there was a little baby curled up inside me warm and comfy, safe from the world. I would rub my belly and smile knowing he was growing inside me. But now he is gone. I just can’t wrap my brain around it.”
Otis, 30, confirmed the couple lost their child to a miscarriage in their second trimester.

“I read statistics online that said there’s only a 3% chance of miscarrying in your second trimester,” she shared. “No one ever thinks they will be part of that small 3%, but here we are.”
The Married at First Sight: The First Year star explained how moving on from the tragedy has been difficult.
“I just have no motivation to do anything,” she said. “Yesterday I slept until 1 pm in the afternoon. When I woke up I didn’t want to get out of bed, but I took my pups for a long walk thinking that may help. I cried off and on. I just came home and fell on the couch in a big ball with silent tears streaming down my face.”
Otis then revealed how her husband has been remained “very strong” during the devastating time, even resuming his normal activities.

In an effort to cope with the loss, Otis decided to name their unborn child Jonathan Edward.
“We wanted to name our baby the perfect name,” she wrote. “He deserves a beautiful name to be remembered by. When I read that Johnathan means ‘gift from God’ I silently sobbed and rubbed my belly. We decided to name our baby boy Johnathan because he is truly a gift from God. Doug’s middle name is Edward after his grandpa. Our firstborn will share daddy’s middle name. I think this is so beautiful and meaningful. I hope this little boy knows how much his mommy and daddy love him.”
Otis broke the news on July 13 with an Instagram post.
“Our Baby Hehner was just too beautiful for earth,” she wrote. “I love him so much – ALWAYS will – and can’t wait to meet him in heaven one day.”

'The Godfather Notebook' — Classic Film Secrets Exposed/n
This holiday season offers up the ultimate gift for fans of the 1972 classic The Godfather — as legendary director Francis Ford Coppola reveals how a cinematic masterpiece came together!
“When I realized that I was actually going to make a movie out of The Godfather,” said Coppola, “I sat down and began to read the book again, very carefully, my pencil poised.”
Now those writings — and many more secrets behind the legendary classic — are seen for the first time in The Godfather Notebook.
It’s a publication packed full of Coppola’s original notes on the novel by Mario Puzo, plus script pages that show the evolution of the director’s epic vision of a new kind of gangster film!
The Godfather Notebook is a reproduction of a genuine artifact from the movie — reproducing the pages that Coppola carried with him as he met the major talents who’d come together to make The Godfather one of the most acclaimed films of the 20th century.
Readers will discover untold stories of how Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and other unforgettable stars were cast during a grueling production process.
Coppola also shares the secret family touches that he hid as props on the film set, and reveals how the director anticipated the audience’s reactions to classic scenes.
The Godfather Notebook is over 700 pages of classic cinema, and is available in both a standard edition and a deluxe limited edition.
The deluxe edition — only available at ReganArts.com — is autographed by Coppola himself, as the director shares a valuable possession that he swore he “would never part with or sell!”

EXCLUSIVE! Vanderpump Rules' Scheana Marie Reveals the Moment She Knew Her Marriage Was Over After their friends Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz tied the knot in August 2016, Scheana suggested to Mike that they go on a second honeymoon i.../n
Scheana Marie didn't want to give up on Mike Shay.But, had she stayed with him, she would have given up on herself. After the season finale of Vanderpump Rules aired Monday (the three-part reunion kicks off at 9 p.m. Apr. 3 on Bravo), E! News' Will Marfuggi interviewed Scheana to find out why her two-year marriage really ended."There were a lot of things from the beginning of our marriage that kind of tainted the whole relationship. Three months in I found out he had a pill problem. Right before our one-year anniversary, I saw some inappropriate text messages," said Scheana, who married Mike Shay in 2014. "Then, fast forward to our second anniversary, and I'm just trying to pretend like everything's fine, because in my mind, we're married—for better or for worse."

"'This is the worse part, but we have the rest of our lives to figure it out. This is a temporary rough patch.'"But wishful thinking wasn't enough to save the former couple's marriage. "I kept telling myself, 'It'll get better. It'll get better.' And it did. In the beginning of 2016, everything was genuinely good. Then the cameras turned on again, and then he changed. That's when I found out he started using again. I didn't know that at the time," said Scheana, who is now dating Robert Valletta. "My mom and other people around me had noticed a change in his behavior. I was either oblivious to it or I just didn't want to believe what I was seeing right in front of my face."

Whenever friends or family would question Mike's behavior, Scheana would make excuses to protect him—and to keep up the façade that everything was A-OK. "In hindsight, I'm like, 'Oh, my God!'" the reality star admitted. "All of these things are plain as day and I just didn't see it."

After their friends Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz tied the knot in August 2016, Scheana suggested to Mike that they go on a second honeymoon in Hawaii to start over. The romantic getaway was "fine," but after they returned home to L.A., Mike "was always in the studio and I was always at home by myself. We were growing apart more and more," she said. "Towards the end of October, he just didn't come home one day." The timing couldn't have been worse, as Scheana was dealing with a death in the family. "During those two weeks I found out he was buying pills again. That's when I was like, 'I'm going to give him one more chance to tell me the truth.'"

When she finally spoke to Mike, "I looked him in the eyes and he lied to me. That's when I was like, 'Now I don't have another choice. I know I fully cannot trust you ever again.'"While it wasn't what she wanted, Scheana said, "A divorce was the only thing we could do."

"I had never considered getting a divorce whatsoever, because I took our vows very seriously. This was the 'for worse' part. I just thought that we would be able to get through it, because he was still my best friend. We had so much fun together. I felt like all of those things would outweigh the bad, and eventually, we'd pick ourselves back up and be fine," she told E! News. "During those two weeks, I was still willing to forgive him for leaving me the day someone passed away and taking all of this money out of my account and all of these things. I'm like, 'I can get past pretty much anything.' I'm a very forgiving person—as we see on the show."

Two days before her on-camera reunion with Mike, Scheana joined her fellow cast members for a Vanderpump Rules premiere viewing party at Kristen Doute's apartment. In the midst of their excitement, Scheana was told her husband was buying pills again—and that flipped the switch."I was like, 'I'm now done. I'm done. I'm done. Nothing at all can change my mind. I was willing to forgive you after you left me, and try and move past that, and work through it and start over and become best friends again and do all of this.' I was still willing to try," Scheana said. "The second I found out he was still lying to me—and had been for six to eight months—I was done."

The divorce "completely" took Mike by surprise. "How can we ever have a real future when I can't trust you? You're lying. You're stealing. It was just one thing after another that I kept forgiving, but then something worse would happen. It became just unforgivable at that point," Scheana shared. "I couldn't ever move forward with him when so much trust had been broken."To see what Mike has to say, watch the Vanderpump Rules reunion, beginning Apr. 3 at 9 p.m.(E! and Bravo are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)

‘You’re A Deadbeat!’ Briana DeJesus RIPS Baby Daddy Luis For Ditching Daughter/n
Briana DeJesus’ baby daddy Luis Hernandez promised he would be in their daughter’s life if she didn’t place her up for adoption – and it looks like he didn’t stand by his word. The Teen Mom 2 star revealed her second baby daddy has been a “deadbeat dad.”
DeJesus, who gave birth to daughter Stella in early July, has posted photos of her youngest daughter on social media. Then on July 29, Hernandez posted a photo of their little one with the caption, “My chicken nugget.”
Days later, DeJesus went on a rampage!
“Don’t take photos of MY kids and put them on social media or send them in group chats to ur friends to act like u a dad,” she wrote on Snapchat. “U is a deadbeat my guy.”

DeJesus also slammed him and Devoin Austin, who is father to her daughter Nova, 5, on Twitter.
“Lmao why men fold so quick when s**t gets real? I’ll never understand,” she tweeted. “A damn shame I got more balls than both my baby daddies.”
She added, “If you knew better you’d do better.”
On Teen Mom 2, DeJesus contemplated placing their daughter for adoption when she learned Hernandez cheated on her.
“I was stupid, it was childish,” he told DeJesus. “I legit want us to be together and to go on with the plans we’ve had.”

When she suggested adoption, he fired, “That’s not happening so you could end that conversation right there. I might be a liar, I might be an a*****e, but I am about family and I would never give my daughter up for adoption.”
DeJesus explained how she doesn’t want him to be as uninvolved as Austin, as she revealed he has only seen their daughter twice in six months.

Thomas Gibson Getting Kicked Off Criminal Minds Permanently For Writer Assault?! See What Sources Are Saying!/n

Thomas Gibson must be kicking himself over that outburst. Ha!
On Thursday, it was reported that the longtime Criminal Minds star was suspended from the CBS crime drama for 2 weeks after kicking a writer in a heated creative dispute.
But now it looks like the actor's vacation might be a permanent one, because executives are thinking of kicking him off the show completely!
According to TMZ, production sources said writers for the show are putting together a storyline for next season that gets rid of Gibson's character, Aaron Hotchner.
Related: Tyga Reaches A Settlement With His Ex-Landlord!
We assume Virgil Williams — the writer/co-executive producer who was kicked in the shin — is conjuring up a pretty gruesome death scene involving Hotch's legs being thrown into a wood chipper. (This is Criminal Minds, after all…)
If Gibson does manage to stay on the long-running series, he will never work as a director again — which was the role he assumed that led to the kicking and screaming fit.
But if he does get the axe, maybe we can finally get that Dharma & Greg reunion we've all been waiting for! Though we're sure she wouldn't approve of all this violence… LOLz!

Evelyn Lozada: Leaving My Broken Marriage/n
As a cast member on VH1’s hit series Basketball Wives, Evelyn Lozada had what it took to be a reality diva. The ex-fiancee of former NBA player Antoine Walker tossed drinks, attacked costars and hurled insults with the best of them. But once she tied the knot with NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson (formerly Ochocinco) on July 4, she says she was ready to settle down outside Miami, play house and put that kind of drama behind her. On Aug. 11 “I was going to cook dinner: salmon, mashed potatoes and a tomato mozzarella salad,” Lozada recalls. While unloading the grocery bags, she was stunned to discover a receipt for a box of condoms purchased after they were married. “I’m not naive,” says Lozada, who claims Johnson cheated throughout their relationship. “I didn’t think he was going to be perfect,” she says. “But three weeks after we got married? I felt like he was not even trying.”
Disheartened by the discovery, Lozada decided to take a drastic step and demand a divorce. That evening she confronted Johnson, 34. According to Lozada, he flew into a rage, grabbed her face and head-butted her in the forehead. Bloodied and stunned, Lozada, 36, fled to the home of a neighbor, who called 911. Then she went to the hospital for “five or six” stitches. “I had blood in my eyes, I was tasting it,” says Lozada. “I remember realizing, oh my God, the news is going to get out. I was so humiliated.”
The consequences for Johnson have been swift. Charged with simple domestic battery (the football star was ordered to attend anger-management classes stemming from a domestic battery episode in 2000), he spent the night in jail and is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 13. The Miami Dolphins cut him from the team, Lozada has filed for divorce, and the couple’s reality series, Ev & Ocho, already filmed for VH1, has been shelved. “I would like to apologize to everyone for the recent events that have occurred,” he said in a statement. “I wish Evelyn well and will never say anything bad about her.” (A spokesperson for Johnson declined further comment.)
While their romance played out before the cameras, Lozada insists it was real. Most of the time “he was happy, uplifting and spontaneous,” says Lozada, who met Johnson via Twitter in 2010 and accepted his proposal-and a 10-carat diamond ring-just four months later. “One day we took a helicopter ride to Key Largo for breakfast. He was a very romantic and sweet guy.”
But Lozada says Johnson-who thrilled audiences on Dancing with the Stars in 2010 and starred in his own VH1 dating show, The Ultimate Catch, that same year-had a dark side. The couple fought over his Twitter flirtations and female admirers. “I always knew [to back down] when he got that look in his eye,” Lozada says. “It was scary.”
Lozada also alludes to past “situations,” but won’t elaborate out of respect for Johnson’s four young children. (Lozada, who “loves being a stepmother,” says that she and his oldest daughter, Jicyra, are “besties.”) As for critics who assume the on-screen firecracker physically provoked Johnson: “I never once lifted a finger to Chad, not that day, not prior. I never attempted to do anything to him.” Still covering up a scar on her forehead, Lozada hopes to inspire domestic-abuse victims to seek help and regrets her own aggressive behavior on TV. “You learn from it,” she says. As for Johnson, “I got to start life over,” he tweeted Aug. 29, “and create a new one.”
Though Lozada says she hasn’t spoken to Johnson since that night, “I’ll always have love for him,” she admits. But that’s as far as it goes. “I don’t care what the argument is, or who the man is, this should never be tolerated,” she says. “Chad is not a bad person, but he made a bad choice.”

Next stop: Germany!As Prince William, Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton and their youngsters Prince George and Princess Charlotte continue their European travels this week, the royal family of four touched down in Berlin Wednesday.The special guests dressed in shades of blue akin to Germany's national flower, the cornflower. Middleton sported a vivid coat by Catherine Walker while her 2-year-old daughter stepped out in a pint-sized floral dress, blue shoes and a matching bow in her hair. Prince William stuck to a traditional suit with a blue tie and a sleepy 3-year-old Prince George kept to his usual shorts and collared shirt.

Little Charlotte completed her ensemble with a special accessory—a bouquet of flowers all her own. The little one was a diplomat in training as she shook hands with an official greeting them and walked with her mini posy. Meanwhile, little George looked a bit restless as he leaned on his father while his parents were busy in conversation. The royal couple took their children by the hand and walked down the red carpet together before getting into a car and heading to the German Chancellory for an official welcome from Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Next stop? The Bradenburg Gate. The royal couple arrived to throngs of enthusiastic residents waiting to greet the special guests. German residents shook hands and offered gifts to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they made their way around the crowds.

Bobby Shmurda: Close To Freedom ... Legal Team Making Push /nBobby Shmurda finally has a slight glimmer of hope -- his legal team has a plan to spring the rapper from jail as early as Thursday. Sources close to the case tell TMZ ... Shmurda's family has stepped forward to offer up collateral for his $2 million bond. Most notably, Bobby's aunt has put several properties on the line to help set the rapper free. We're told the family has been working closely with NY bondsman Ira Judelson.  As for why Bobby's team feels this bail package will be approved? We're told they've put together a 200 page document that details the source of every single penny, and it's essentially  "bulletproof. " His camp is pushing to present its case to a judge ASAP. You'll remember, Bobby was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and other weapon and drug charges late last year, and has been sitting in jail since then. We reached out to Shmurda's attorney Alex Spiro about the arrangement, but he had no comment. /n
stopping the Hollow, also known as the creepy evil force that's taken over New Orleans.  Davina was killed last season after the ancestors cursed Kol (Nathaniel Buzolic) to get revenge on Davina for her magical actions. After Freya (Ril.../n
When all of New Orleans is in trouble, there's apparently only one young witch who can save the day. Danielle Campbell is returning to The Originals for one episode, E! News can exclusively reveal. She'll reprise her role as Davina Claire in the May 12 episode of the CW series, called "Voodoo in my Blood." In the episode, Hayley (Phoebe Tonkin) and Klaus (Joseph Morgan) travel to the ancestral world after being summoned by the ancestors, and while there, they come face to face with Davina. She's the one person who holds the secrets to stopping the Hollow, also known as the creepy evil force that's taken over New Orleans. 

Davina was killed last season after the ancestors cursed Kol (Nathaniel Buzolic) to get revenge on Davina for her magical actions. After Freya (Riley Voelkel) tried to use her as a magical conduit, Davina untethered the ancestral world from the physical world and trapped herself there. Hayley tried to comfort Kol by saying Davina had found peace, but we'll just have to see if that's actually true. "Voodoo in my Blood" will also find Marcel (Charles Michael Davis) and Elijah (Daniel Gillies), forced into an uneasy alliance, meeting with The Vampire Diaries' Alaric Saltzman (guest star Matt Davis), who has tracked down a crucial artifact that could help in their fight against the Hollow. 

The Originals airs Fridays at 8 p.m. on the CW.

One BET fan wrote on their website: “[W]hat is Hollywood’s excuse for casting a white woman this time?”Photo credit: Gzoe saldana nina simoneFor many Zoe Saldana isn’t dark enough to play the late Nina Simone in the upcoming biopic of her life. When stills from the set emerged showing Saldana wearing makeup to give her a darker appearance, critics came out of the woodwork. Singer India Arie penned an article saying: “VIOLA DAVIS should be playing Nina Simone.”Photo credit: Fjennifer lawrence hunger gamesFor fans of The Hunger Games book series, Jennifer Lawrence was deemed too big to play the role of heroine Katniss Everdeen. Even critics weighed in with The New York Times reviewer saying her “womanly figure makes a bad fit” and The Hollywood Reporter pointing out her “lingering baby fat.”bridgett jones renee zellweger For millions of readers Helen Fielding’s beloved character Bridget Jones was quintessentially English.

Comedienne Rosie O’Donnell echoed that view, saying on TODAY: “I don’t think she’s right for the role and I don’t think she’s capable at this point to portray that character.”heath ledger the jokerWhen Heath Ledger was cast to play The Joker in The Dark Knight, the blond, square-jawed Aussie hunk was not the fans’ first choice.

Bad joke.”Zendaya aaliyah“I’m just a 17 year old girl who got cast to play one of her biggest inspirations #positive.” That’s what Zendaya tweeted after facing a backlash because she was cast to play Aaliyah in a TV movie about the R&B singer’s short life. The teen eventually dropped out of the project.Photo credit: Gtom hddleston hank williamsIt’s never a good sign when the family member of the real-life person an actor is portraying slams the casting choice. But that is the case with Hank Williams’ grandson who is not happy that Avengers star Tom Hiddleston – a posh Brit – is playing the country star. Hank Williams III apparently thinks 44-year-old Matthew McConaughey should play his grandfather who died at the age of 29.Photo credit: Gjohnny_depp TONTOThe film was universally panned, but The Lone Ranger got off to a bad start before it ever made it to the big screen in 2013 purely because of the casting choice. Many Native Americans were not happy that Johnny Depp would be playing the iconic role of Tonto, an American-Indian character.gone with the windIt was the most sought-after female lead in Hollywood at the time with greats like Bette Davis chomping at the bit to get the role.

Vivien Leigh later won an Oscar for her performance in the 1939 classic.michael keaton batmanNothing about Michael Keaton says broad-chested, square-jawed comic book hero, so fans of Batman were naturally enraged when the Beetlejuice star signed on to don the black rubber suit in the 1989 version of the movie. Apparently 50,000 of them wrote letters to Warner Bros. to protest the casting choice.

Not gonna lie, kinda ruined the movie.” That’s what one mean-spirited Hunger Games fan tweeted after Amandla Stenberg played one of the pivotal characters in the movie.Idris Elba thorSome Marvel fans were so outraged that Idris Elba had been cast as a Norse god in Thor, that they started a campaign urging others to boycott the 2011 movie. The Council of Conservative Citizens – a white nationalist group – was particularly upset that a black man had been selected to play the role.
 Jake-Gyllenhaal-Prince-Of-PersiaSimilarly some critics were fuming that Jake Gyllenhaal was cast as Dastan, the central character in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Filmmaker and blogger Jehanzeb Dar told the LA Times in 2010: “It’s insulting that people of color – especially Middle Easterners or South Asians – are not allowed to portray ourselves in these roles.”

'The Simpsons' -- Mrs. Krabappel to Be Written Off Show ... But Not for A While /nMrs. Krabappel WILL be written off  "The Simpsons " in the wake of the death of the actress who voiced the character ... but it's not going to happen for a while, TMZ has learned. TMZ spoke with  "Simpsons " E.P. Al Jean who tells us ... no one could possibly fill Marcia Wallace's shoes as the voice of Ned Flanders' 2nd wife -- so they're not even going to try. Al says producers do plan to write Edna off the show -- but there's no rush, because the series is produced so far in advance, Marcia had a year's worth of episodes recorded when she passed away. TMZ broke the story ... Edna is NOT the mystery character that producers had planned to kill off the show this coming season.  Al wouldn't say how Edna will leave Springfield.  As for Marcia, we're told the legendary comedy actress will be laid to rest in the next few days in a private ceremony.

NO PLACE TO HIDE! Kentucky Man Claims Innocence In Wife's Murder/n
After a daring escape, abused wife Rachael Madison thought she was done with her “violent hubby” — but he tracked her down and shot her dead, police say.
The 44-year-old brunette’s remains were found in a remote area off a Tennessee interstate, hours after Jarvis Wayne Madison, 58, was arrested in Louisville, Ky., and grilled by the FBI in December.
Ironically, Rachael thought she’d escaped his vicious abuse when she fled to Florida to live with her aunt Thelma Newsome just weeks before the murder.
“She’d been threatened with knives and guns and she was tired of it. She wanted to get away. She made a plan,” says Thelma.
PHOTOS: Drugs, Death & Arrests—Bobbi Kristina Brown’s 50 Most Shocking Moments
Rachael and her savage husband had been living in motels and out of his 2011 Honda Pilot around the Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio borders.
During that time, he poured acid on her back to burn off a tattoo and scarred her neck with knife slashes, say cops.
But in mid-November, Rachael called Thelma, who drove to meet her niece in a Kentucky bookstore.
Weird Wayne sniffed out the escape plot and, armed with a .45 caliber handgun, took his wife hostage in his car and began driving across America, cops say.

He also issued a chilling warning, says Thelma, who told police Madison said: “You are going to be burying her and it’s all on you. When the police show up, I will have my gun in hand. I am going to send her to hell, I am going to kill her.”
But brave, desperate Rachael convinced Madison to let her use a restroom at an Indiana Walmart on Nov. 14. Inside, she called cops, but by the time officers arrived, Madison had fled!
Rachael later was able to flee to her aunt’s in Ormond, Fla., and planned build a new life.
But on Nov. 27, she left at 1:30 p.m. to run on the beach and vanished. Thelma called 911, telling the dispatcher about Madison: “I’m afraid he has abducted her.”
Days later cops nabbed him in Louisville, Ky. Investigators say he admitted shooting Rachael three times while she sat in the passenger seat of his car and then buried her in Tennessee.

Investigators say they found blood on the passenger’s seat, a gun, a receipt for a shovel and a cellphone containing pictures of Rachael’s dead body!
Despite police records of his confession, Madison insists he’s being framed!
“No, I did not kidnap my wife, I love my wife,” he told reporters, adding that Rachael went “to be with Jesus. She won’t suffer no more because of her ex. I didn’t kill her.”

 The Truth Behind Mika & Joe’s Mar-a-Lago Visit- ‘They Were All Over Each Other'.../n
Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough finally came clean about their relationship when they got engaged last month in France, but RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively that the Morning Joe couple had been romantically involved with one another long before they officially came out as a couple.
In the several months leading up to their engagement, the duo worked hard at hiding their relationship, “pretending” they weren’t “together.” But, according to an insider super close to the situation, the co-hosts of the politically charged MSNBC morning show couldn’t contain themselves during their visit to President Donald Trump’s Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, this past New Year’s.
An eyewitness, who was at Mar-a-Lago at the time, reveals to Radar exclusively, “Joe and Mila were all over each other!”

“They were not hiding the fact they were in a relationship,” our informant snitches, noting, “It was sickening to see, especially because they were pretending at that time they weren’t together.”
Brzezinski divorced her husband of 23 years, James Hoffer, in January 2016. But the divorce wasn’t without scandal, as many believed her romantic involvement with her Morning Joe co-host had caused the split.
Scarborough was divorced from his wife of 10 years, Susan Waren, in 2013.

For the women who made "hot topics" famous, they certainly had a few of their own behind closed doors. As The View approaches its 20th anniversary on Friday, the nostalgia is hitting about the nearly two-dozen women that have graced the ABC talk show's signature table. While they're certainly encouraged to disagree on the air, thanks to the show's co-creator Barbara Walters' 2008 memoir, Audition, we also know the ladies couldn't keep the drama from leaking into their dressing rooms—and beyond. From secret weight loss surgery to a well-timed job offer, here are a few stories that shaped the inner workings of The View straight from the co-creator herself.

1. A Scale Situation With StarWhile it's well known now that Star Jones underwent gastric bypass surgery during her time on The View, originally it was the entire panel's secret to keep."We expected her, when she felt well, to talk about the procedure on the air as it was such an important aspect of her life and could hardly be kept secret—or so we thought," Walters wrote. "After the operation Star said she didn't want to become what she called a 'poster chid' for the procedure and have to answer a lot of questions. I understood that, but it put us all in a terrible position. It meant we virtually had to lie for Star, especially when she said again and again on the air that her weight loss was due primarily to portion control and Pilates."It wasn't until 2007—four years after the procedure and a year after leaving The View—that she publicly admitted to the surgery. 

2. Pulling a Live TV Fast OneAccording to Walters, Jones wanted a lavish wedding to Al Reynolds and used the show to promote businesses in exchange for their free services. While they eventually stopped them on The View, Jones allegedly continued the strategy with other public appearances.Eventually, Star and the fixation on the wedding became ongoing material for tabloid fodder and the bad press began to affect Jones' likability and, in turn, the show's ratings. When ABC did not renew her contract, Walters wrote that she told Star she could use any excuse she wanted for why she was leaving to protect her career. Meanwhile, Vieira was also leaving to join Today and executives had offered Rosie O'Donnell a 1-year contract as a replacement.  

Jones, who allegedly did not get along with O'Donnell at the time, picked a day to make her exit announcement. However, two days earlier, she surprised the entire panel when "she said that after much 'prayer and counsel,' she had decided to leave the program. Her announcement took us totally by surprise," Walters recalled."Thinking she had just decided to move up her announcement date, I asked the audience to rise and give her a standing ovation. But, as it turned out to our astonishment, Star had, over the previous weekend, given an interview to People magazine. In the magazine, which was about to hit the newsstands, she announced that she had been fired. It was not the drop in her popularity among viewers that had caused her dismissal, Star insisted, but the 'new direction' the show wanted to take—that is, Rosie."

3. Millionaire Saves the ShowWhile Meredith Vieiraultimately spent 11 years hosting Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, it wasn't her original offer. As Walters claimed in her memoir, "In the spring of 2002, CBS News came after Meredith offering her a lot more money to join a new early-morning lineup that was planning yet another View-like panel. Meredith was tempted. But she didn't really want to chance her future on a brand-new show, and she was very happy on The View."So, in an effort to secure the star, Walters spoke to ABC about Vieira hosting Millionaire, which was about to be syndicated for daytime. "We breathed a sigh of relief when she turned down the CBS offer," Walters added. 

4. A Rough Time for RosieAfter O'Donnell famously called Donald Trump a "snake oil salesman" and falsely claimed that he had filed bankruptcy on the air, Walters apparently had to go into damage control. After Trump threatened to sue, Walters and co-creator Bill Geddie got on a conference call with him and said they would work to clear up the bankruptcy error. While O'Donnell was still on vacation, Walters issued remarks on the air about O'Donnell's inaccurate statement and sang her praises after Trump criticized her publicly. As Walters claims in her book, however, "when Rosie finally returned to The View, to my amazement she angrily berated me in the dressing room for not defending her enough. She said I had told Donald Trump during the conference call from the yacht that I didn't want her on the program. Bill and I insisted that I never said any such thing. She refused to believe us."

Fortunately, as Walters added, things eventually returned to a "calmer state" between the two women.

Lorde Faces Backlash After Likening Her Friendship with Taylor Swift to an “Autoimmune Disease”/n

Lorde is sorry.

The “Green Light” singer issued an apology to fans after comparing her friendship with an A-lister like Taylor Swift to an “autoimmune disease.”
While recently speaking with The Guardian, the 20-year-old shared the difficulties in being close with someone who is constantly in the spotlight. “It’s like having a friend with very specific allergies,” she said. “There are certain places you can’t go together. Certain things you can’t do. There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship. It’s like having a friend with an autoimmune disease.”
The comment quickly generated backlash amongst the fandom, especially given Selena Gomez — a notable member of Taylor’s squad — suffers from lupus.  One Twitter user wrote, “I wonder how @selenagomez feels about this. What an incredibly ignorant analogy to make @lorde.”

Lorde apologized for the remark on Monday night (June 19, 2017), explaining she didn’t mean to offend anyone who was suffering from an autoimmune disease.
“Didn’t mention taylor, but regardless, i f**ked up & that was really insensitive. i’m sorry,” the 20-year-old tweeted alongside an emoji of a rose.

Last year, Lorde gushed about Taylor, 20, when the “Bad Blood” songstress threw her a birthday party complete with a star-studded guest list comprised of Lena Dunham, Karlie Kloss, Aziz Ansari, and Mae Whitman.
“Had the best birthday party I’ve ever had tonight surrounded by my nyc family,” she shared on Instagram. “All organised by tay who is as she says ‘a mom with no kids’. I am ur kid and u love me so hard I could burst. Here’s to our 3 magic years of best friendship and more moments like this squished between angels.”

New Sex Offender Named In Brutal Holly Bobo Murder Case/n
Holly Bobo’s murder mystery just took another dark turn, RadarOnline.com has learned, as a new sex offender was found in the shocking case.
Terry Britt, a convicted sex offender with a long history of sex-related crimes, was brought up in court by alleged killer Zachary Adams’ lawyer, who said the prosecutor was withholding evidence as the trial approached.
While Adams’ attorney Jennifer Thompson denies the claim that her client’s DNA was found in the scene of the crime, he is still awaiting a definitive trial. If convicted of the victim’s murder, he Adams faces execution.
Supporting the evidence that Britt may be to blame for Bobo’s murder, Thompson even told the judge she wanted a “tape recorded interview of Terry Britt on 5-10-13.”
PHOTOS: Blood, Guts & Gore! The Top 20 Bloodiest Crime Scene Photos Revealed
As Radar can reveal, Britt was previously accused of “rape in 1977, sexual battery in 1987, and rape again in 1996,” according to Tennessee’s News 4.
Zachary’s mother, Cindy Adams, told the station that she believed Britt should have been investigated for Bobo’s murder.
“It just overwhelms me to just read all of this information and to not know why this guy was not further investigated. I mean, it breaks my heart,” she said.
The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation raided Britt’s home following Bobo’s disappearance, and questioned him about the incident. He lived roughly 10 miles away from her family home.

As Radar previously reported, Bobo, 20, was kidnapped from her home in 2011 and dragged into the woods by a man dressed in camouflage, leaving a trail of blood behind her.
“I think the TBI just wanted an arrest. They really didn’t care who they arrest [sic]. It boils down to that,” Adams added.
Britt was arrested ten months after Bobo disappeared, and indicted for a 2008 kidnapping and rape of another woman who lived two counties away.
His wife told the news station that she was with him on the day that Bobo was snatched from her home, but the TBI refused to reveal if he was ever formally cleared as a suspect in the murder.

Britt remains behind bars for aggravated kidnaping and attempted rape, and is scheduled to be released in 2018.
Zachary Adams’ trial is scheduled to begin on September 9, 2017.

Barbara Walters: Elisabeth Hasselbeck Not Leaving The View/n
Unlike Joy Behar, who announced she is leaving The View, Elisabeth Hasselbeck is staying put.At the top of Monday's episode, Barbara Walters cleared up the rumors that her fellow cohost was departing the ABC daytime program."There is a particularly false story that keeps getting picked up about Elisabeth's alleged departure, saying that we don't approve of her conservative views. The truth is we love Elisabeth. I like her personally and she's just a wonderful person. But beyond that, we value and appreciate her point of view because Elisabeth helps give this show perspective and balance, so we have no plans for Elisabeth to leave show," Walters said.

She added, "Having said that to all of you, [producer] Bill [Geddie] and I have always said that when one of you makes the choice to leave, that's your choice and we will support your decision."Walters' words come on the heels of a rep for The View telling E! News that Hasselbeck "is a valued member of The View and has a long-term contract."

Kylie Jenner’s makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, is in hot water with its customers again after fans noticed that some of the reality star-turned-mogul’s limited edition products look exactly the same as some of her pre-existing lip kits.

People have been taking to social media to show that Jenner’s Blitzen, a liquid lipstick that comes in her exclusive $45 holiday gift set, looks remarkably similar to Spice, a plum-colored lip kit that’s available all year around for $29. Many have even compared swatches of the two shades against one another, only to find that they look almost identical.

Kylie Cosmetics has been repackaging their general line lipsticks and making them limited edition. Example: spice and blitzen pic.twitter.com/VbVNqfahFs

the description for spice is a deepened raspberry-plum, and Blitzen is apparently a warmer version of that @KylieJenner please explain HOW pic.twitter.com/NUEoqlC7SD

Why are Spice and Blitzen the same exact shade just different packaging? I’m so mad 😒🙄 @kyliecosmetics @KylieJenner pic.twitter.com/BQiPdjmCFI
— cindy alvarez (@__calvarez) December 1, 2016

In fact, some customers have noticed that several of Jenner’s signature colors have been seemingly recycled and resold as so-called “new” shades. This includes a classic like Candy K — one of the three original lip kits from Kylie Cosmetics — allegedly being rebranded as Khlo$ from the Koko Collection, a special edition set that was sold for $40.

This wasn’t the first time Jenner was accused of repackaging products, either. Last summer, some people claimed Jenner copied YouTube star and beauty vlogger Shannon Harris’ eyeshadow palette with BH Cosmetics. As Harris released her product three months before Jenner even announced she was expanding her makeup empire, many thought the 19-year-old stole the idea and ripped off Harris’ design by featuring nine similar-looking shades of eyeshadow in a white square box.

The copycat allegations came after beauty blogger Stephanie Nicole outed Kylie Cosmetics for using the exact same ingredients as ColourPop in their lip kits. ColourPop’s founders later confirmed that their products and Jenner’s liquid lipsticks are made in the same lab.

The self-described FFP (former fat person) brought up Christina as part of her DO’s and DON’Ts of Body Confidence feature.  
“Sometimes it’s other people’s voices you have to shut out. That’s what happened with me and Christina Aguilera, which people don’t understand. She called me fat for years,” Kelly explains.

“One night on Fashion Police I said, ‘F—k you. Now you’re fat too.’ I didn’t say I wasn’t fat. I said, ‘Now you know how it feels.’ And I’m sorry, but I stand by that. I make a point on the show never to say anything about anybody that I wouldn’t say directly to their face. I’m famous, and she’s famous; it doesn’t mean I can’t stand up for myself.”
“I took it for 10 years and finally decided to be like, ‘You know what? I’m done.’ And that’s the last thing I will ever say about it.”

“Even now I don’t consider myself skinny,” Kelly also admits in the article.  “But I have put a lot of hard work into my body over the years, and in the process, I’ve really learned to love myself.”

“Harrison Ford’s left leg was broken in an accident,” the spokeswoman said in a statement to CNN.

Jay-Z Raps About “Natural Twins” and “Stillborns” in New Song About Beyoncé/n

                    Beyoncé and Jay-Z's Twins Were Born Premature
                







Details on the birth.

Jay-Z is getting personal on his new album, 4:44.

In the title track, which is available exclusively on Tidal in conjunction with IHeartMedia, the rapper opens up about his 15-year relationship with Beyoncé and their struggles to have kids. Apologizing to his wife, Jay-Z goes into detail about pregnancy problems while referencing his newborn twins.
“I apologize often womanize / Took for my child to be born / See through a woman’s eyes / Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles / Took me too long for this song / I don’t deserve you,” Jay raps.
He continued, confirming suspicions he had previously cheated on his wife, “And if my children knew, I don’t even know what I would do / If they ain’t look at me the same / I would probably die with all the shame / ‘You did what with who?’ / What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? / ‘You risked that for Blue?’”


Later in the song, Jay-Z alludes to the couple losing more than one baby prior to welcoming the twins. Though Beyoncé previously mentioned a miscarriage before Blue Ivy’s birth in the 2013 documentary Life Is But a Dream, this is first reference to the loss of children.
“So I apologize / I’ve seen the innocence / Leave your eyes / I still mourn this death / I apologize for all the stillborns / ‘Cus I wasn’t pressing / Your body wouldn’t accept it,” he says.
As reported, Jay-Z and Beyoncé welcomed twins on June 12 in Los Angeles. While the couple have yet to confirm the name and sexes of the babies, rumors say the twins are a boy and a girl.

Ben Wallace -- OUT OF JAIL ...

Wallace was released. But Ben's time in lockup wasn't the shortest celebrity stint -- that honor would probably go to Nicole Richie ... who only spent 82 minutes in jail from a 2006 DUI./n

Casting News! ‘Transformers’ Star Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Auditions for ‘Mad Max’ Sequel/n

It's a style showdown between Megan and Rosie!

                    10 Facts About Rosie
                







Find out more about Rosie!

 MORE >>





 When there’s an armageddon event erupting on screen, movie directors seem to have Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in mind.
Following her role in Michael Bay’s $195 million action flick Transformers: Dark of the Moon, the model-turned-actress, 24, is being considered for the upcoming Mad Max sequel.
Mad Max: Fury Road has yet to begin filming but, according to Australia’s The Daily Telegraph, Rosie was spotted entering Juanita Nielsen Community Centre in Woolloomooloo, Sydney, where the film is secretly holding casting calls.
Not too long after the sighting, director Goerge Miller was seen in the same building.
Did she get the part?

No word yet, but it has been confirmed that Inception star Tom Hardy will replace Mel Gibson, 56, who portrayed Mad Max Rockatansky in the 1979 classic.
 
Charlize Theron is also set to star in the sequel as well.
The original Mad Max movie was about dystopic future Australia where a vicious biker gang murder a cop’s family and make his fight with them personal.
“We keep moving that around, you know?” Hardy said coyly when asked about production of the film during the Cannes Film Festival.
“Who knows when it’ll come out? I’ve been on standby for two years, but it’s all part of it.”
Will Rosie be a good addition to this star-studded movie, or does she need a bit more experience? Perhaps her action star boyfriend Jason Statham could give her a few pointers! Let us know what you think, below.

Catherine Zeta-Jones Joins Ryan Murphy's Feud as Olivia de Havilland Ryan Murphy's Feud, you know the new series starring Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, just got a little more star-powered (who knew that was possible?) thanks to.../n
Ryan Murphy's Feud, you know the new series starring Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, just got a little more star-powered (who knew that was possible?) thanks to Catherine Zeta-Jones. Murphy tweeted Zeta-Jones will play Olivia de Havilland in the new anthology series. The first season of Feud tells of the feud between Hollywood icons Joan Crawford and Bette Davis when they co-starred in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"Thrilled that Oscar-winner Catherine Zeta-Jones is joining FEUD as Oscar-winner Olivia de Havilland," Murphy tweeted.Feud also stars Alfred Molina, Stanley Tucci, Judy Davis and Dominic Burgess.Zeta-Jones won an Oscar for her work in Chicago. She'll portray Oscar-winning de Havilland who took home Academy Awards for To Each His Own and The Heiress. De Havilland's other credits include Gone With the Wind, The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Snake Pit. Zeta-Jones' last TV role was the 1996 Titanic miniseries.

"Ryan keeps re-inventing TV," John Landgraf, CEO of FX Networks, said in a statement when the show was announced. "Nip/Tuck brilliantly extended the boundaries of ad supported television. Glee re-imagined the television musical. American Horror Story pioneered the modern anthological series, which has rapidly transformed the television landscape and been widely copied. The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story was recognized by many as the best and most talked about new show this year. And all of those shows have been award-winning ratings hits. Feud adds a third and equally ambitious franchise to Ryan's unprecedented slate of FX anthological limited series and marks our third such collaboration with studio partner 20th Century Fox Television/Fox 21. The series will offer a seductive, insightful look at what lies behind legendary personality conflicts."Feud also counts Brad Pitt and Dede Gardner as executive producers with Lange and Sarandon also on board as producers. Production will start this fall for a 2017 release.

'Big Brother' Houseguests Furious Over Unwanted Butt Poking/nSeveral  "Big Brother " competitors are claiming their butts are being violated by a fellow houseguest for weeks -- who's been captured on video jamming her fingers into various dumpers without consent. The anal invader is Jessica Graf -- whose schtick is to approach unsuspecting houseguests from behind and surprise them with a deep oil check. Graf has been recorded pulling the move on Paul and Matt -- who were upset about it and confronted Jessica. Problem is, she laughed it off as a joke. Another female houseguest, Alex, claims Jessica pulled the same move on her -- poking her in the butt and the vagina. During a live feed from the house, Alex got emotional when describing the incidents to houseguest Josh -- and said it affected her because a family member had been raped and killed.  Paul and Kevin have discussed Jessica's actions in the house -- and said if she was a man poking women, she would be in jail for sexual assault. We reached out to CBS for comment. So far, no word back./n
Man Arrested For Having Sex With A Donkey Claims It Was A Shape-Shifting Prostitute/n
By Radar Staff
A man in Zimbabwe who was charged with bestiality after being caught having sex with a donkey came up with a very interesting defense for his sick crime, RadarOnline.com has learned. 
After he was busted for violating the donkey in the early hours of Sunday morning, 28-year-old Sunday Moyo told the court that just hours earlier the animal was a human hooker that he picked up in a nightclub, reported Gawker.com. 
“Your worship, I only came to know that I was being intimate with a donkey when I got arrested,” Moyo of the Mandava township in Zvishavane told the members of the court on Monday, who then all broke down into hysterical laughter.
PHOTOS:   Celebs Who Have Done Jail Time
Moyo was caught red-handed in the middle of his hot tryst when police on a routine patrol spotted Moyo mounting the animal, which was tied by his neck to a tree and lying on the ground.
“I had hired a prostitute and paid US$20 for the service at Down Town night club and I don’t know how she then became a donkey,” he told Zvishavane magistrate Mildred Matuvi, reported the NewZimbabwe.com.
PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots
But not only did he get intimate with the long-eared animal, Moyo now claims he’s in love with his hot date!
“I think I am also a donkey. I do not know what happened when I left the bar, but I am seriously in love with (the) donkey,” said smitten Sunday, according to The Herald newspaper.
PHOTOS:  Sexy Stars Who Have Been Arrested 
There is no word from the donkey as to whether the feelings are reciprocated. 
Matuvi ordered that Moyo be remanded in custody until Thursday and be examined by two government psychiatrists.

Steve Harvey Humiliated Over Mayweather/McGregor Fight Outing/n
Steve Harvey was jabbed on Twitter over his prime seat at the Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor boxing match in Las Vegas on Saturday night.
Although Mayweather triumphed in the oddball fight, Harvey was the loser on social media as fans questioned why the Little Big Shots and Family Feud host got a better view than LeBron James and other stars.
They also dissed Harvey’s hammy “drunk uncle” demeanor at the fight.
Harvey, 60, was very noticeable ringside as he wore a big burgundy colored coat and appeared to be rooting for Mayweather.

According to a report, WME-IMG agency head Ari Emanuel received 250 tickets to give to celebrities for the fight and he and his team had a hard time deciding who got the best seats.
But reportedly in the seating “nightmare,” it was decided Harvey merited the big spot!
But social media users disagreed, with one Twitter skeptic typical of the response, writing, “Steve Harvey having better seats than LeBron is the upset of the night in Vegas, regardless of if McGregor wins or not.”
Fight fans also blasted Harvey for his appearance and reactions in the crowd as Demetrius Harmon Tweeted, “yall see steve harvey in the audience acting like a drunk uncle.”

ImGoinScottie wrote on Twitter, ” Steve Harvey had to buy his mustache a separate ticket.”
Although Radar has reported that Harvey’s advisors have urged him to dump his large suits and get a fashion makeover, the TV star was watching boxing in his usual style.
Haters on Saturday night also recalled Harvey’s previous blunder announcing the wrong winner at Miss Universe 2015, as CPB snarked via Twitter, ” Let Steve Harvey nowhere near the judges scores.”
PHOTOS: Out Of Here! Steve Harvey Flees Country Amid Marriage Problems
Cade Madson tweeted,  I love Mcgregor but the only way he’s winning this fight is if Steve Harvey announces the decision.”
Radar has reported on Harvey’s scandals in a series of explosive stories.
At one point this summer, he left the U.S. during his marriage problem scandal.
But this weekend, he enjoyed his ringside seat immensely, as all could see!

Katy Perry Explains Why She Ended Calvin Harris Feud: ‘It Was Time to Put All That Behind Us’/n
Katy Perry recently teamed up with Calvin Harris for his hit song “Feels” but the feelings weren’t always mutual between the two.
The MTV Video Music Awards host recalled her various “falling outs” with the deejay and producer, which occurred prior to Perry feuding with Harris’ future ex-girlfriend, Taylor Swift.
Speaking with Ryan Seacrest on his On Air with Ryan Seacrest show Wednesday, Perry explained: “We’d had little falling outs here and there. We’d had some public Twitter spats … Eight years or so had passed. It was time to put all that behind us.”
In 2011, Perry and Harris exchanged words on Twitter after Harris pulled out of Perry’s U.K. tour dates. In addition, Perry seemingly responded to drama between Harris and Swift regarding the former couple’s collaboration on his 2016 single “This Is What You Came For.”
RELATED VIDEO: Swish Swish, Bish! Katy Perry Set to Host the 2017 MTV VMAs

During her interview with Seacrest, the “Swish Swish” singer also recalled how their resolution came about.
“We just bumped into each other and he said, ‘I think I have a song that maybe you should come check out,’” Perry added. “I was like, ‘Cool,’ because we had always meant to work together for years and years and years.
“I came to the studio and he played me a bunch of unfinished but really solid moments for his new record,” she said. “Then he played me this one part for this new song called ‘Feels’ and I was like, ‘Oh yeah.’ This is like my favorite song off the record. I was just down to do it.”
The 2017 MTV Video Music Awards will air live from The Forum in Inglewood, California, on Sunday, Aug. 27 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.

Rob & Chyna's Family Feud Explodes On Camera/n
Rob Kardashian is locked in an all-out war with his sisters and mother over their unprecedented move to block his wife from trademarking her soon-to-be-name, Angela Kardashian, but the beginning of their drama was all caught on video.
Blac Chyna’s efforts to lock down her married name were blocked by a nasty legal rebuke from Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian‘s lawyers, incurring the wrath of Rob who was furious with his sisters for their actions against his fiancée.
A new sneak peek of the Rob & Chyna Baby Special shows his monster momager in the delivery room, just days before she orchestrated the dastardly legal filing, happily watching the first Kardashian named child being born.
PHOTOS: Delivery Room Drama! Inside Blac Chyna’s On-Camera Delivery
But as Radar exclusively reported, Kris Jenner was the mastermind behind the legal maneuver, and her son is now threatening to quit the family business in the wake of the betrayal.
“Kris went over to Rob and Blac’s house to try and make everything right, but Rob blew up on her when she got there because he believes that she was responsible for this,” a source close to the family told Radar. “Rob is certain that Kris was actually behind the whole entire thing.”
“After Rob went off on his sisters, they told him that the whole thing had been Kris’ idea and that they really had nothing to do with it. Kris was the one that directed the lawyers to take action.”

Trendsetters at Work: Bradley Theodore When someone makes a documentary about you (and then it's shown at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival), you've made it right?  If you don't yet know the name Bradley Theodore, we're not .../n
When someone makes a documentary about you (and then it's shown at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival), you've made it right? If you don't yet know the name Bradley Theodore, we're not quite sure what rock you've been living under. (Have you not seen the colorful mural of a skeleton-like Karl Lagerfeld staring into the eyes of Anna Wintour?) The NYC-based, Turks and Caicos-born street artist is truly one of a kind—bringing impressionistic high fashion to the streets of New York City.Ready for your intro?How did you get into painting?I've always studied art—in high school and in college. I actually studied digital arts in college, but while working some friends I realized I just didn't want to do it anymore. In the next 10 years, everything was going to be digital, so I felt like it really was my only chance and last chance to paint and make a career out of it.

What's the coolest mural you've created?The one of Anna Wintour and Karl, I think, was the coolest—I just instantly loved it. I had initially painted it on canvas, but when I switched it to a mural it really came to life.What's the most daring career risk you've ever taken?I think doing my very first show in London was the biggest risk. It's the hardest market in the world to get into and be loved by. They're very strict and the market is so particular, but it turned out to be a great decision for me.Who are some of your career heroes?I'm a big Picasso fan. Also, Willem De Kooning, Ray Smith and another is Ran Ortner.

What's the best piece of advice you've ever received?One person told me to "keep on doing what I'm doing." To me that's always meant just to believe in yourself, always.Your paintings were a hit this past Halloween, what was it like seeing so many dressed as your artwork?It's absolutely crazy. It's such an honor that people want to immortalize my paintings for their Halloween costumes.Do you have any exciting projects or events coming up that you can tell us about? Film festival artist and US Open and the next thing I'm doing is a pop up during London fashion week at a hotel Hari Hotel –putting up about 30 – 40 paintings there and then I'm also doing a show in the Maddox Gallery in London in April. 

Finish the sentences below:Today for lunch I had…fish and chips (I'm traveling in London right now).The first website I log onto every day is…Google.com...then Bloomberg.com.My usual Starbucks order is…a Chai tea and a blueberry muffin.If I wasn't doing this job, I would…be a farmer.My favorite place to visit is…Turks and Caicos.List what's on your desk right now…paintings, moleskin and a ton of pigments.The book I'm reading right now is…The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.

NFL Star Alfred Morris -- Takes Fancy Waiter Job ... After 2 TD Performance/n24 hours after a dominant TWO touchdown performance, Washington Redskins running back Alfred Morris was already back to work ... as a waiter a fancy steak restaurant. Morris -- and several of his teammates strapped on some aprons for  "Celebrity Waiter Night " at Ruth's Chris in Arlington, VA ... where the guys served up appetizers to raise money for charity. On his way into the steak joint, Morris told us being a waiter is CAKE compared to his job on the gridiron ... saying,  "All you do is smile and be polite!

Slender Man Creator Releases Heartfelt Statement After Child's Brutal Stabbing In Wisconsin/n

So sad. 
The creator of Slender Man, Eric Knudsen, has released a statement on his thoughts about the case where two 12-year-old girls stabbed another girl 19 times. 
The two 12-year-old girls claimed they were acting as "proxies" for Slender Man, and had hoped to join the fictional character in a mansion after their premeditated murder attempt. 
Thankfully the victim survived the ordeal, but the case and the Slender Man character have gripped the nation as people try to wrap their heads around what really happened.  
Well, Eric Knudsen, who created the character in 2009 on the website SomethingAwful.com., has since shared his thoughts on what happened in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Here's what he said this past Wednesday: 
“I am deeply saddened by the tragedy in Wisconsin and my heart goes out to the families of those affected by this terrible act."
His publicist has since stated that there will no further interviews given by Eric Knudsen after this statement. 
Even though we unequivocally believe that Eric Knudsen had no part in this tragic case, we can imagine it must be difficult for him to see a beloved character of his associated with such a REAL awful crime. 
Our best wishes to the victim in this case, and we hope she has a speedy, complete recovery.

A Giant Donald Trump Rooster Has Gone Up Behind The White House! See The Best Twitter Reactions To The Yuge Cock!/n

Donald Trump is only on Day Five of his 17-day golf vacation, and already someone else is ruling the roost.
A giant inflatable rooster has gone up at a park behind the White House, AKA the "dump" they make the POTUS live in.
The chicken was also the mascot of protesters demanding to see the Crook-In-Chief's tax returns in April, so we're guessing it's there for tonight's protest of Trump's ad-libbed nuclear threats.

Billie Lourd to Inherit Mom Carrie Fisher's Estate/n
Carrie Fisher's only child, daughter and actress Billie Lourd, is the beneficiary of her multi-million dollar estate and details about it were recently made public.The Star Wars actress died at age 60 in December. Her mother and Singin' in the Rain star Debbie Reynolds passed away a day later at age 84 after suffering a stroke.Court documents obtained by E! News list details about her living trust and reveal Billie, 24, is its beneficiary. She is set to inherit her mother's 2016 Tesla S, personal items such as jewelry, artwork and collectibles, the money in four of the actress' bank accounts, ownership of her companies and a life insurance policy. She will also obtain the rights to Carrie's public image and likeness. 

Not all of the actress' belongings will go to Billie; Some 1,500 are set to be auctioned off and proceeds from the auction, which was announced a few weeks ago, will go to Debbie' charity The Thalians and The Jed Foundation, a charity chosen by Lourd.Items set to be put on auction include Carrie's life-size Princess Leia statue inside a British vintage British phone booth, her personalized director's chair from the Star Wars: Return of the Jedi set—which reads "Star Wars: The Saga Continues" and a life-size C-3PO with electronic lighting elements and a life-size bronze, limited edition Yoda statue that she also owned."My mother and sister were magnificent collectors, they amassed an amazing and diverse collection in their lifetimes," Carrie's brother Todd Fisher said in a statement. "The size and scope of their collection rivals most museums. So in keeping with my mother's wishes we have decided to share part of their magnificent collection with all their friends and fans."

Meanwhile, the multi-million dollar side-by-side Hollywood Hills homes Carrie and Debbie owned are set to be sold as one property for an estimated $18 million, reports said last month.

 Dope Fiends! Heroin Junkies! Hollywood Top Drug Dealers Tell All On Celebrity Stoners.../n
In stunning, bombshell confessions, four of Hollywood’s top drug dealers reveal to Radar the A-list celebs who eagerly bought their illegal products like cocaine and heroin.
The shocking list includes Iron Man hunk Robert Downey Jr., super Scientologist Kirstie Alley, Charlie Sheen and even Today host Matt Lauer.
“I sold drugs to Hollywood’s biggest stars!” boasts one pusher. “I got them everything!
“I’ve been backstage at the Oscars to make a coke score. I’ve been to TV sets and film sets,” brags the dealer. “I’ve accompanied both old and young stars on private jets to Vegas, Mexico and Hawaii.”

The pusher went to Hawaii with an actor who would get so wrecked on crack cocaine, he’d go ape and trash his Maui hotel suites.
“Finally, we partied on a private beach, where he held an orgy one night,” recalls the dealer.
Another dealer tells Radar he sold squeaky-clean TV newsman Matt Lauer cocaine five or six times and even snorted the drug with him when he worked at a local Rhode Island TV station.
“I think he used the drug to relax,” says the dealer, who passed a lie detector test.
PHOTOS: Is Charlie OK? Sheen Emerges After Six Weeks!
Radar also tracked down Robert’s tattooed heroin dealer, nicknamed “Mr. Brownstone,” in a nod to the high-octane, brown Mexican smack he pushes.
The superhero actor has been sober since 2003 and a jail stint.
But the pusher met Robert around 1986 when the star was a dope fiend.
“I was making a delivery to some guy’s house and Robert was there,” he recalls. “He told me he could offer me a lot of business, so I gave him my numbers.”
PHOTOS: Banged Up! Charlie CAUGHT With Mysterious Bandages On His Wrist & Knee
The dealer says Robert “would call me two or three times a week, always wanting cocaine.
“I mainly deal in heroin — but I like to help people with coke and speed as well. So I’d get him some coke. It was nothing for him to want a thousand bucks’ worth.”
Mr. Brownstone would contact Robert by dialing the actor’s pager code, 21.
Eventually, the star got hooked on smack — which the dealer supplied to him until the mid-1990s. Mr. Brownstone also sold drugs to actor River Phoenix, who would die tragically in an overdose.

Another dealer serviced Anger Management train wreck Charlie.
He says the HIV-positive, hooker-loving star threatened to shoot himself in the head in the late ’90s during an all-night, drug-fueled debauch at the actor’s Malibu mansion.
“Charlie was totally wasted, sitting in a chair, when two hookers he’d hired decided to videotape themselves having sex with him,” says the dealer.
“The gag backfired horribly when Charlie had a psychotic breakdown. He got a gun, put it to his head and said: ‘How’s this? How about I kill myself? Wouldn’t that be f***ing funny? Because I’m killing myself anyway!’ ”
Shockingly, Cheers star Kirstie, now a devout member of drugs-loathing Scientology, had a $400-a-week coke habit for two years.
“Kirstie was living like some whacked-out hippie in a tent” on a friend’s floor, recalls the pusher.
When his A-list customers want drugs, they dial Mr. Brownstone — who still uses an old-school pager — and punch in their secret codes so he can call them back.
“One very famous couple are always joking that they have to be so secretive that they feel like James Bond when they make a buy from me,” he notes. “So their pager code is 007!”

Rashida Jones Designed the Prettiest Pastel Luggage Collection for Away/n
Away is a lightweight suitcase made for modern-day travelers, with a hard shell, interior compartments, a laundry bag, and built-in USB chargers. Not to mention, you can buy a set of two suitcases for less than one might cost from other luggage brands.
Each season, the brand unveils an Away Edition capsule, a collaboration inspired by the experiences of well-known travelers. This fall, it partnered with actress and producer Rashida Jones, an Away fan since her first trip with one of its suitcases.
“I found it to be my dream idea of what luggage should be: durable, functional, cute, simple, not fussy, and not too serious,” she said.

Away co-founder Jen Rubio describes Jones as “an expert traveler with an incredible eye for design,” so it was a no-brainer when the opportunity arose to collaborate.
Edition RJ is a whimsical, yet refined collection inspired by Jones’ trips to Stockholm. Having always been drawn to the elegant simplicity of Scandinavian design and its effortless blend of playfulness, Jones wanted to design a line that captured that sensibility. Her capsule features all four sizes of luggage in three shades she feels perfectly embody Stockholm: cactus green, clay pink, and violet, a set of four color-coordinated packing cubes, and an exclusive Stockholm Tote.

“I love the idea of being able to bring some magic into something banal,” Jones said of the collection. And the fun colors are practical, too, allowing you to spot your bag on the baggage claim carousel instantly.
“I think we underestimate the toll that carrying luggage has on us, especially if you travel a lot,” Jones said. And this was the motivation behind the exclusive RJ Stockholm Tote, which you can hold, wear cross-body, or use the smart slat to slide it over the handle of your suitcase.
We caught up with Jones for a quick take on her most treasured travel memories and the places on her wish list.

What are some of your favorite places in Stockholm?
“My number one is Ett Hem, a beautiful hotel. It’s [name] means ‘at home’ and it genuinely feels like I’m at home when I’m there. I really love visiting the Modern Museum — so beautiful — and there’s a great view of the city upstairs. There are so many inspiring female designers that I’ve met there: Carin Rodejber, Kristina Tjader from House of Dagmar… just badass, smart feminists who design beautiful clothes for powerful women. I also enjoy visiting all of the little islands in Stockholm, which I just find to be so cool. All the bridges you walk over connecting the individual islands may just be my favorite part.”
What’s the most memorable trip you’ve ever taken?
“Tokyo — I went there for the first time four years ago and it just felt like I belonged there. The city has its own beautifully unique vibe, and I love the attention to detail and the sense of respect. I loved crossing the intersection, Shibuya, which is one of the biggest intersections in the world and yet it’s so quiet, the opposite of Times Square — so magical.”
Anywhere you haven’t been that’s on your list?
“Yes! I want to go to South America, I’ve never been there, and I want to go to Australia.”

Kourtney Kardashian Steps Out in Plunging Little Black Dress for Date Night with Younes Bendjima/n

They went to church together on Wednesday night. But on Thursday evening, Kourtney Kardashian and boyfriend Younes Bendjima had a more traditional date night — stepping out in Los Angeles for an evening of fun at The h.wood Group’s new nightclub Poppy.
Both were certainly dressed for the occasion — Kardashian looking incredible in a strapless little black dress, its plunging neckline nearly reaching her belly button.
Pap Nation/Splash News
The 38-year-old Keeping Up with the Kardashians star accessorized her look with a simple pair of pointed black heels, dressing them up with sheer black socks. She kept her signature dark brown hair pin-straight.
“Kourtney and Younes were canoodling all night long and couldn’t keep their hands off of one another,” says an onlooker. “They were hugging, kissing and dancing and seemed super happy together.”
Bendjima, 24, kept things cool in a cameo button-down shirt — which he layered over a black T-shirt. He paired the look with silver, shiny jogger pants, black New Balance kicks, and a silver chain necklace.
All Access Photo/Splash News
Kardashian’s younger sister Kendall Jenner also hit up the club and was “spotted getting cozy” with her ex Jordan Clarkson, adds the source. Later in the night, however, her rumored fling Blake Griffin showed up and Clarkson “left the table.”
While at a private birthday celebration for Sofia Richie at 1 Oak LA the same night, though, there appeared to be no bad blood between Clarkson, Jenner and Griffin. Griffin kept close to Jenner throughout the night, and the pair left the party together along with pal Hailey Baldwin.
Poppy is L.A.’s new hotspot, The Hollywood Reporter reported — attracting a series of A-list stars like Gwyneth Paltrow, Justin Bieber, Kate Hudson, Jessica Alba, Drake, French Montana, Gigi Hadid, Kanye West and more.
Taking over the former STK space, the new club’s concept is inspired by Gucci and other high-end fashion designers according to co-owner John Terzian — who told the trade publication that, “even though there are other great clubs in L.A., there’s a need to get to the next level of decor and design.”

Meanwhile, Kardashian and Bendjima continue to remain hot and heavy since they first sparked romance rumors in May when they stepped out for a dinner date in Los Angeles (and were later spotted cuddling at a luxury private villa in Cannes).
Earlier this month, the couple had an epic vacation in Egypt — a source close to the mother of three’s reality show telling PEOPLE that, “Kourtney had the best trip.”
The insider added that Kardashian “likes her relationship with Younes, because it’s all fun and play.”
“She likes going to exotic places with him,” the source said. “They already have another trip planned. She seems very happy.”

 Reba McEntire Talks America’s Food Crisis & Outnumber Hunger Concert: ‘I Think.../n
Country superstar Reba McEntire knows the power of celebrity, whether it is supporting Little Big Town’s controversial song, defending Kelly Clarkson’s mothering or lending her name to try and end hunger in America.
In an exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com, McEntire revealed her reasons for headlining a concert for Outnumber Hunger, saying that she believes that the shocking statistics about food-deprived families is outrageous.
“I am involved 100 percent and I am proud to use my celebrity status to make everybody aware of the problem of hunger in our country.”
“I found out one out of six Americans are hungry. That flabbergasted me. I haven’t missed a day without having a meal. So I am going to lend my celebrity status to trying to make it so people don’t have to go days without having food because I think that is criminal,” she told Radar.
McEntire says the program is simple: “Buy a box of Cheerios [or any specially marked General Mills product], read the back of the box, there is a code that you can enter online and General Mills and Big Machine Label Group donate five meals to a local food bank in your area.”

“I hope that everybody gets behind it,” McEntire said. “It is so easy to help out. It’s so easy to do.”
The veteran entertainer told Radar that she was looking forward to performing at the Outnumber Hunger, saying “I’m really down to Earth, I love to be on stage and get that instant response.”
She will be performing from her brand new album, Love Somebody, at the concert and said participating in Outnumber Hunger was an easy choice for her. “I thought it was a great idea the way they made it so easy for people to participate. It is so easy to give back. Bob Hope taught me that. Of all the things you get to do, giving back is the most important.”

The singer also shared with Radar a glimpse into her personal life, gushing over her recent dinner with step-daughter-in-law Kelly Clarkson and her baby. “We were with Kelly’s band and crew and River Rose. She was passed around to everybody. She’s got the cutest little grin. Kelly is a great mom,” she said.

Actor Jesse Williams Trapped In Explosive Custody War With Longtime Wife/n
Days after announcing his traumatic custody battle with estranged wife Aryn Drake-Lee, Grey’s Anatomy star Jesse Williams is breaking his silence and telling his side of the story, RadarOnline.com has learned.
This Thursday, the actor stated that Drake-Lee was heading to court in hopes of gaining full custody of the couple’s two children, even after he requested joint legal and physical custody following their split.
“These are matters for the court to decide,” Williams’ rep said in a statement. “Jesse has been working tirelessly to maintain his bond with their children and it is important to note that the dramatizations made in Aryn’s declaration are a one-sided account made with a specific goal in mind.”

As Radar can report, the couple married in 2012 and as of now, shares custody of daughter Sadie, 3, and son Maceo, 2. They filed for divorce back in April after trying marriage counseling 2016 and being “unsuccessful.” Friends of Drake-Lee claimed that their relationship didn’t work simply because Williams now “wants to be the hot single guy in Hollywood.”
According to court documents obtained by ET, Drake-Lee claimed that the big-screen actor has a problem controlling his tempers, and that his career has caused him to miss numerous events in their children’s lives – including Sadie’s preschool graduation.
The mom-of-two also claimed that due to his job, he has “shared his time with the children with intimate partner[s].”
“The judge is fully informed on both sides of the story and will be making the final decision,” said Williams’ rep.
Livid, Drake-Lee also alleged that her estranged husband cheated on her, as various rumors circled that Williams had a fling with stunning actress, and The Butler co-star, Minka Kelly.

He denied all claims in a video, saying: “I was in a relationship 13 years. 13 real years, not five years, not seven years, 13 years, and all of a sudden mother**kers are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship — like, the most painful experience I’ve had in my life, like, with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart — that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.”

                    Kate Middleton Didn't Know About Sister Pippa's Engagement
                







Surprise!

Pippa Middleton, the sister of Kate Middleton, will be getting married very soon!

The 33-year-old will tie the knot with fiancé James Matthews at St. Mark’s Church in Englefield, England on May 20, according to E! News. The Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Prince Harry are all expected to attend. Kate’s son Prince George is said to serve as a page boy, while daughter Princess Charlotte will act as a bridesmaid.
The news comes hot on the heel of rumors that Pippa has forbidden Harry’s girlfriend, Meghan Markle, from attending the nuptials for fear that their much talked-about relationship will steal the spotlight. Many British tabloids, including The Sun, are providing much fodder, claiming a “no ring, no bring” policy is in place.
“It’s clear Pippa doesn’t want to be outshone by any TV babes on her big day,” a source says, adding future brother-in-law Spencer Matthews has also allegedly been advised not to make his girlfriend, reality star Vogue Williams, be his plus one.

“Pippa’s view is that Vogue’s relationship with Spencer is still very new. It wouldn’t be appropriate for her to be there after just a few months of dating,” the insider dishes. “But some people in the circle are pretty shocked because this is her future brother-in-law who’s going to end up attending on his own. It’s certainly raised eyebrows.”
The gossip mill started churning in March when Harry brought Meghan to pal Tom Inskip and Lara Hughes-Young’s wedding in Jamaica, prompting rumors that the date inspired Pippa to put a ban on girlfriends at her ceremony. “She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan’s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos,” a source told the Daily Mail at the time.
Pippa and James, a hedge fund boss, got engaged last summer after after a year of dating. They’ve known each other for more than a decade.

Desperate? LuAnn De Lesseps Stands By Cheating Fiance To 'Stay Relevant' On 'RHONY'/n
LuAnn de Lesseps may claim her relationship with fiancé Tom D’Agostino is “stronger than ever” after Bethenny Frankel exposed his shocking cheating scandal. But the Real Housewives of New York star is actually still “devastated” by the betrayal, a source tells RadarOnline.com.
“Obviously this is still really heartbreaking for her,” the insider claims.

However, the former Countess, 51, is staying with her man for more than just love, the source explains: She’s forging ahead with the wedding despite D’Agostino’s infidelity because she knows the romance is keeping her relevant!
“She had been reduced to a lesser role, and her relationship with Tom put her back to front and center,” the insider says. “She’s upset by the drama, but more so, she wants to remain on ‘Housewives.'”
“Tom is her ticket to staying on the show.”

Indeed, back in season 6, the divorced mother of two was demoted to a “friend” of the Housewives following her break up from French businessman boyfriend Jacques Azoulay.
Back in July, Radar was first to report that Frankel caught D’Agostino making out with another woman on camera days before the couple’s engagement party.
“LuAnn was shocked and heartbroken,” a source said. “But she decided to stay with him.”
The drama finally unfolded on the Bravo series last night. /n
 Peter O'Toole's Sex Scandals Revealed: Orgies, Affairs & Unwanted Pregnanices –.../n
In a new biography detailing the alleged sexcapades of Hollywood legend Peter O’Toole, titled Peter O’Toole: Hellraiser, Sexual Outlaw, Irish Rebel, authors Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince make some shocking claims regarding the late actor.
While O’Toole was one of the most sought-after performers in his heyday, he was also allegedly known for his raunchy jaunts.
“Off-screen, [O’Toole] starred in weeklong binges and sex orgies of near-biblical proportions,” Prince calims.
After allegedly losing his virginity to stripper Bubble LaRue at the ripe age of 13, the star-to-be had learned all the tricks in the book to become a Don Juan of his time.
PHOTOS: Top Celebrity Sex Scandals
From his rumored affair with Princess Margaret in 1963 – during which he once enjoyed a luxurious bath with the royal – to his steamy romance with actress Audrey Hepburn, O’Toole supposedly left no stone unturned when it came to beautiful women.
Though his affair with Audrey Hepburn ended in heartbreak, the actress supposedly found herself pregnant amid the steamy affair in 1965, unsure of whether husband Mel Ferrer had gotten her pregnant or O’Toole.
In the end, she suffered a miscarriage and their relationship fizzled.
Most shocking of all, perhaps, is the book’s detailed account of O’Toole’s alleged tryst with a transgender woman.

While filming Lawrence of Arabia in 1961, the handsome hunk met April Ashley, a model and fashion icon who, unbeknownst to him, was transgender.
With stars like Ava Gardner, Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Dors, Jayne Mansfield and Anita Ekberg supposedly under his belt, O’Toole racked in a reported 1,033 lovers in all!
The salacious biography, Peter O’Toole: Hellraiser, Sexual Outlaw, Irish Rebel, is now available on Amazon. /n

As we said, it didn't make a whole lot of sense for them to take an infant to a theme park she can't appreciate, so it seems liked it was more for them than the kid. Now we've found out Rob's been there every day and every night ... going on a week. They've been socializing with friends and family with BBQ's and a pool party, and they've taken hikes together. Chyna dropped a ton of cash on gifts for Father's Day, including a Louis Vuitton bag, a customized Dodgers hat, sneakers and white and blue roses emblazoned with an  "R.

Rosie Won't Bid Adieu to "The View"/nRosie O'Donnell shot down any speculation yesterday that she might be leaving  "The View. " "Don't anybody worry where Rosie's going – she's right here, " said O'Donnell, rumored to be leaving after her contract ended in the summer. Reports swirled that she might bolt to join the cast of FX's drama  "Nip /Tuck, " on which she's had a starring role. But Rosie pointed out she could shoot her episodes of  "Nip /Tuck " while  "The View " is on hiatus during the summer.Sources have suggested that Rosie's had a tough time fitting in at  "The View, " but there's no doubt that she's been ratings gold for the show – last month it had its biggest November audience ever. Dolly Pardons Jessica for  "9 to 5 " Flub Dolly Parton told Jessica Simpson not to worry about her shaky performance at the Kennedy Center Honors, saying that Jessica is  "so talented and that she'd be  "honored " to return the favor someday.Parton released a statement in which she waved off Simpson's nerve-wracked rendition of  "9 to 5. "  "Jessica is so talented that I'm sure that someday they will be paying tribute to her and I would be honored to perform for her, " said Parton.  "But I'll probably be so nervous that I'll forget my wig! "  Jay-Z and Beyonce: Still Not Married Beyonce ambushed her Jiggaman with a stunningly expensive three-day birthday party – but it didn't turn into the nuptials that had been rumored. As Rush & Molloy report, the supposed  "wedding, " which was meant to be happening this weekend, isn't, and the couple and their lucky pals are already back from the birthday party. Still, what a party it was: The couple and 20 of their closest pals boarded two chartered 757s Monday night (one had a 20-seat movie theater), boarded a 270-foot yacht in St. Martin, then swam, snorkeled, and even submarined into the depths of the ocean for two days. An R&M source estimates that the sybaritic shindig cost $1 million per day.  Lindsay's Mysterious  "LR " Revealed In the bizarre email uncovered yesterday by Page Six, Lindsay Lohan mentioned that she might sue a certain  "LR " for tattling on her to the tabloids. That  "LR, " says the Post, is her former assistant, Lindsay Ratowsky. The two Lindsays have had a famously rocky relationship ever since Ratowsky ditched Lohan to work for Jessica Biel, and she fumed when Ratowsky showed up to an event last week with Biel. Meanwhile, as TMZ reported yesterday, Al Gore doesn't know anything about helping La Lohan do an image makeover, nor do the Clintons, either, as the freckled phenom had suggested in her missive. Party Favors: Tori's Yard Sale Starts in Four Short Hours! ... Heather Mills Taking Her Own Counsel ... Richard Hatch Appeals Conviction Tori Spelling is selling her stuff today in Studio City, so get there early (it starts at 9 AM PT) and sharpen those elbows. She tells People,  "I wanted to get organized before the baby arrives, so this seemed the perfect time to clean house. " You can snap up her  "90210 " memorabilia and  "jeans that [her] preggers butt can't fit into anymore. " ... Heather Mills has fired Anthony Julius of London law firm Mishcon de Reya and will be representing herself in her divorce proceedings because, according to her rep, she can't afford a lawyer ... Original  "Survivor " winner Richard Hatch is appealing his conviction on tax-evasion charges, saying that he had agreed with the show's producers that his tax burden would be shouldered by them, which they deny.

Donald Trump Doesn't Understand Why The Civil War Happened — So Twitter Happily Explained!/n

Now that he's president, Donald Trump is asking all the questions people have been too afraid to ask.
Like… why was there a Civil War?
No, really. POTUS actually asked that question — like it was something people had never thought to explore — in a recent interview with the Washington Examiner.
Related: Trump Lies About Crowd Numbers At His Anti-WHCD Rally!
Sitting down with Salena Zito, President Alt-Facts argued that the war might not have happened if Andrew Jackson had still been kicking — as he was the closest to a Trump-like negotiator who could have pulled off a settlement deal between the feuding regions.
Here's the full exchange, revealing Trump's silly little thought process on the subject: 
TRUMP: was a swashbuckler. But when his wife died, did you know he visited her grave everyday? I visited her grave actually because I was in Tennessee.
ZITO: That's right. You were in Tennessee.
TRUMP: And it was amazing. The people of Tennessee are amazing people. They love Andrew Jackson. They love Andrew Jackson in Tennessee.
ZITO: He's fascinating.
TRUMP: I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War. He said, "There's no reason for this." People don't realize, you know, the Civil War — if you think about it, why? People don't ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?
Okay, well, first off: Jackson couldn't have been "really angry" about what was happening with the Civil War, because he died over a decade (1845) before it began (1861).
Video: Hasan Minhaj Roasts Trump At The 2017 WHCD!
But if we overlook that detail, this isn't the first time Trump said there was really no reason for a major war.
In an interview with Reuters, the Big Cheeto said he didn't understand why the Israelis and the Palestinians have been fighting for all these decades, musing:
"…I want to see peace with Israel and the Palestinians. There is no reason there's not peace between Israel and the Palestinians — none whatsoever. So we're looking at that, and we're also looking at the potential of going to Saudi Arabia."
Really, Donny? A real estate mogul like yourself can't understand the property value of the holy land? Maybe Jared Kushner can explain it to you…
Critics pointed out this gem of Trump mouth garbage was particularly contradictory given his preluding to a "major, major conflict" with North Korea — not to mention, dropping the "Mother Of All Bombs" on Afghanistan, ordering airstrikes on Syria, and pissing off his Russian puppet master Vladimir Putin.
But most who responded on Twitter pointed out the irony in Trump not understanding what the Civil War was actually fought over: slavery.
Ch-ch-check out the reactions to Trump's latest World History fail (below)!

1 word answer: Slavery. Longer: When Andrew Jackson died in 1845 (16 yrs before the Civil War began), he owned 150 men, women and children. https://t.co/Icg6puG2JZ

@ChelseaClinton @IndependentlyE If you think Andrew Jackson was mad about the Civil War, you should have heard his thoughts on Vietnam. Not good!
— Ben Hooper (@BenHooperWrites) May 1, 2017


Say what you will about literally every Democrat in the House and Senate, but I'm betting they all know why the Civil War started.
— Franklin Leonard (@franklinleonard) May 1, 2017


The punchline is not the Jackson comment, but Trump's self congratulation on being 1st to ask why the Civil War had to happen

Laila Ali & Curtis Conway -- We Don't Want Our Son to Box ... or Play Football/nLaila Ali's 3-year-old son has some of the greatest sports DNA of all time -- but the boxing legend tells TMZ Sports she REFUSES to push him into boxing ... she'd rather he pick up a golf club instead. Laila and her ex-NFL star hubby Curtis Conway were out in L.A. this weekend when she made it clear -- sports will NOT will come first for Curtis Jr. ... but IF he chooses to play, she wants him to keep his brain safe.  "I'd rather him play golf, baseball or basketball, " Ali says ...  "IF he's going to play sports. I'm not going to force him into sports. "Curtis seems to be fully on board -- 'cause when we asked him what sport he wants to see Jr. play ... the WR was even stronger about keeping his brain in a schoolbooks ... instead of a playbook./n
NFL's Gareon Conley Off the Hook in Rape Case, No Charges /nDidn't take long for a grand jury to decide Gareon Conley's fate -- the Oakland Raiders rookie cornerback will NOT be charged with rape stemming from an April incident, officials say. The 1st round draft pick was accused of raping a woman at an Ohio hotel just days before the NFL Draft -- and prosecutors kicked the case over to the grand jury on Monday morning. But just a few hours later, the jury made a decision to NOT move forward with charges against the former Ohio State star. The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office issued a statement, saying:   "After a thorough investigation by the Cleveland Police Department, the facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations of sexual assault against Gareon Conley were presented to a Cuyahoga County Grand Jury. The Grand Jury returned a No Bill on all possible charges. " Conley had previously admitted to having oral sex with the accuser but insisted it was consensual. The woman had claimed Conley forced himself on her and engaged in vaginal intercourse. Conley had denied any wrongdoing from the start./n

On the outside, HBO’s new series Hung seems like a cheesy, crass dramedy. A well endowed teacher needs to make some extra cash so he becomes a “ho,” and former one-night-stand-turned-poet-wannabe becomes his suburban “pimp.” But it’s not.
Hung is actually a really promising black comedy about a defeated optimist who hits rock bottom. “I used to be a big deal,” states Ray Drecker (played by Thomas Jane – real life husband of Medium’s Patricia Arquette) who starts out living the American dream… an attractive teacher who was a high-school football hero, married with two kids… until everything goes wrong. His wife leaves him for her dermatologist, his house burns down, he loses custody of the kids, and all while the economy is tanking. But life takes an odd and interesting, uphill turn, when his visionary poet-ex talks him into making use of his best (and biggest) asset by starting a new business together called, “Happiness Consultants,” a.k.a. a male prostitution service with Ray being the product for sale. Now in case you’re hoping to get a glimpse at the actual asset, don’t count on it! Thomas Jane says when it comes to the audience actually getting to see “it,” he’s more of a c*ck-tease!

A Look Back at Phil Collins’ Failed Marriage to Daughter Lily’s Mother — and How It Impacted the Actress/n

Lily Collins has grown up in the spotlight — but it hasn’t always been easy.
The 27-year-old actress was caught in the crosshairs of her parents’ divorce when her famous dad, legendary musician Phil Collins, and her American socialite mom, Jill Tavelman, split in 1994 when she was five. The tumultuous divorce proceedings took two years before being finalized.
At the time of the split, there was a widespread rumor that Phil had asked Tavelman for a divorce through fax — the star’s preferred mode of communication at the time.
“[It] really hurt my career, or my public persona,” the 66-year-old told ABC News last fall, at the time he was releasing his memoir, of the fax rumor. “And it was based on an untruth … So, I just thought it would be an opportunity just to lay it all out, and if I say it didn’t happen, I’m trusting that people will believe me.”

The divorce was allegedly spurred by an affair the Genesis drummer and frontman had with an old girlfriend, causing Tavelman to hit back at him about how he had been neglecting their daughter.
Lily “hasn’t seen her father for two months,” Tavelman was quoted telling PEOPLE at the time. “She keeps weeping, ‘I want my daddy.’ Phil sends her faxes, but I know she’d rather hear his voice. Phil doesn’t phone because he has to save his voice for the next day.”

After the divorce, Lily’s relationship with her dad reportedly remained strained once she moved from London to Los Angeles with her mom, though it’s not something she historically chose to address in interviews: “I know the truth and I know how it was for me, and I know how much I love my family – and that’s all that really matters,” she told The Guardian in 2012.
“I’ve grown up knowing that you put as much of your private life out there as you feel comfortable with,” she added at the time.

But now, the young actress is opening up about her famous father in an open letter she wrote for her new memoir, Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me. 
“Because my dad was often gone, I never wanted to do anything that would make him stay away even longer,” she writes in the new book, released Tuesday. “I became extra careful about what I said and how I said it, afraid he’d think I was angry or didn’t love him. And the truth is, I was angry. I missed him and wanted him there.”
She then addresses her dad directly, writing, “I forgive you for not always being there when I needed and for not being the dad I expected. I forgive the mistakes you made.”

Jim Carrey, Robert De Niro Lead Celebrity Tributes to Jerry Lewis: ‘He Didn’t Miss a Beat, Or a Punchline’/n

The world is reeling after news of Jerry Lewis’ death.
Stars like Josh Gad, Jim Carrey, Dane Cook and more have penned moving tributes to the late comedian just moments after news of Lewis’ death broke.
Cook remembered his fellow comedian in a series of tweets, calling Lewis his “mentor and friend.”
“A visionary. A pioneer in all forms of entertainment. A charitable human. A father,” he wrote. Cook added: “He meant the world to me& I will forever cherish the time I got to spend with him & his family. At a dark time in my life he brought me joy.”

— Dane Cook (@DaneCook) August 20, 2017

Actor Nicolas Cage, who starred with Lewis in the 2016 film, The Trust, feels the comedian’s death “marks the end of the golden age of entertainment,” he told PEOPLE in a statement. “He was my inspiration since I was five. His movies saved my childhood and his extraordinary charisma informed all my performances. I would always ask myself, ‘What would Jerry do?'”
Cage added that Lewis “is always on my mind. He was my friend and my neighbor. He was ‘The Total Filmmaker — writer, director, star, and I am deeply saddened that we can’t talk a little more.”
Lewis’ Nutty Professor costar Stella Stevens told PEOPLE she was deeply saddened to learn the news of his death.
“Jerry was a comic genius, and every day on set I learned so much about filmmaking from him,” she said in a statement. “The Nutty Professor remains very close to my heart.  Flights of angels, dear man. Love, your Miss Purdy.”

Meanwhile, Jim Carrey credited Lewis, writing, “I am because he was.”
“That fool was no dummy,” he tweeted. “Jerry Lewis was an undeniable genius an unfathomable blessing, comedy’s absolute!”

The death comes about two months after Lewis was hospitalized in Las Vegas with a urinary tract infection — the latest in a history of health issues.
In June 2006, Lewis suffered a mild heart attack in San Diego. Still, his manager told PEOPLE at the time, “He’s doing very well. He’ll be standing on that stage at the [Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Association] telethon on Labor Day.”
In its time, the annual fundraiser, which Lewis started in 1966 (he stopped hosting as of 2010), is said to have raised more than $2 billion for medical research.

Prior to his heart attack, Lewis had long faced health problems, and in June 2012 was rushed to the hospital with low blood sugar only minutes before he was expected to present an award to Tom Cruise at a New York Friars Club event.
Still, Lewis has managed to maintain his popularity, and legend-status during his decades-long career. His manic style amused generations of moviegoers on both sides of the Atlantic, and his popularity often confounded critics.

Macklemore is lucky to be alive.

The rapper walked away unscathed after his Mercedes was hit head-on by an alleged drunk driver in a pickup truck.
The incident occurred around 11 p.m. just 90 minutes north of Seattle in Langley, Wash. The truck driver was reportedly coming around a bend when the vehicle crossed onto oncoming traffic and smashed into Macklemore’s Mercedes-Benz.
Via TMZ:
Police say the pickup truck driver wasn’t wearing a seat belt and smashed his head into the windshield, leaving him unconscious and bleeding. According to the report, the guy told officers on scene he had a drink “awhile back.” When asked how much, cops say he replied …”5 o’clock.”

Chef Jamie Oliver Says Vegans ‘Annoy’ Him/n

 
Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has weighed in his ongoing battle with so-called anti-meat activists who he says have targeted his restaurants in the past.
Oliver told the Sunday Times Magazine that “20 scruffy, weird-looking fellas [put] iPads of slaughtered animals in front of kids having spaghetti bolognese on a Saturday lunch.” Back in March, animal rights crusaders protested outside his restaurant in Bristol after the chef advocated for drinking milk on an episode of the show Jamie & Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast.
“Vegans do annoy me, but I also do care for them,” Oliver clarified. Though he’s frustrated with interruptions during his lunch service, the fact that he cares for vegan activists actually makes sense.

Oliver founded Jamie’s Food Revolution, an organization that advocates for providing children with nutritious, fresh meals, sustainability in cooking, and ending food waste and childhood obesity. In the past, he’s also encouraged people to eat vegan or vegetarian at least a couple nights per week in order to save money and do the environment of a favor by buying more sustainable, plant-based foods.
RELATED: Jamie Oliver Helped Oprah Recognize Fennel on Instagram — After She Mistook It for Dill
To that end, the chef took aim at British Prime Minister Theresa May, whom says is not doing enough to battle childhood obesity. Oliver thinks she was “watered down” government policies made by the former Prime Minister, David Cameron, to fight the epidemic. For instance, May recently decided to end a school lunch program that gave free meals to young children. In America, President Trump has been accused of similar policy changes.

Oliver is no stranger to stirring up controversy: He recently commented on his now-hopefully squashed feud with fellow British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, calling the situation “pathetic.” Perhaps his public acknowledgment that he cares about anti-meat activists’ cause (even if the protesters do annoy him) will put an end to this beef, too.

President Donald Trump doesn’t want transgender people serving in the military.

The 71-year-old politician announced his plans to ban all transgender people from the U.S. military early Wednesday, tweeting that enlisting them will allegedly burden the government with “tremendous medical costs.”
“After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you,” he wrote on Twitter.
The ban will overturn a June 30, 2016 Pentagon ruling allowed transgender members of the military to serve openly and receive medical care.

“They were having a really good time,” an onlooker told Celebuzz. “Amy was dancing at their table and Chris went to the bar a few times to get everyone drinks. They were definitely happy to see each other again.”
Though the rest of cast — including Aziz Ansari, Adam Scott, Nick Offerman, Rashida Jones, and Rob Lowe — were not present, other celebrities spotted partying alongside the gang included Darren Criss, R.J. Mitte, and The Office alum Kate Flannery.

Colin Kaepernick's GF Roasts Ray Lewis & Ravens Owner with 'Django' Pic/nColin Kaepernick's staying quiet. His girlfriend? Not so much. Nessa -- the famous radio host -- posted a photo of 2 guys who have made all sorts of news by talking about her boyfriend -- Ravens legend Ray Lewis and Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti.  The pic essentially compares the two to characters from  "Django Unchained " -- Samuel L. Jackson's slave-master-loving character and Leonardo DiCaprio's racist master role.  And made sure to @RayLewis.  Clearly, she's not happy with Ray's comments -- in which he advised Colin to keep his mouth shut about his off-the-field activities ... including social activism. Bisciotti is reportedly resisting an effort to sign Kaepernick -- though the team has disputed those reports.  Still, Nessa ain't happy about it. Guessing Kaep feels the same way./n

Kendall Jenner is worth a fortune but she reportedly does not believe in tipping!

The total was for $24 and was put on Kendall’s credit card and while she signed the receipt, she appeared to leave the tip line blank.
This led the bar to remind its followers, ‘Don’t forget to tip your bartender.’
But the post received a mixed reception on social media.

Hillary Clinton Relives Every Sexist Question She's Probably Ever Been Asked on Zach Galifianakis' Between Two Ferns/n
Conversation then turns to Clinton's political rival Donald Trump, where Galifianakis questions whether or not she'd make like many anti-Trump supporters' claims and flee the U.S. for Canada if he's elected. "I would stay in the United States and try to prevent him from destroying the United States," she responds, to which Zach asks, "So you're going to lead the civil war?" "No, I wouldn't take up arms. I think that might be a little extreme," Clinton offers, adding, "I really regret doing this."And like many reporters who've interviewed Hillary during the presidential race, Galifianakis couldn't help but question her wardrobe choice for Monday's upcoming debate. Clinton replies, "There's this thing called the double standard, so I think about what should the first woman nominee of one of our two major parties where to the debate, and I have no idea..."

Hillary does have a prediction for her Republican opponent's outfit for the event ("that red power tie"), whereas Zach muses, "Or maybe like a white power tie?" Clinton reflects, "That's even more appropriate." Shots fired. Watch the rest of Clinton's delightfully awkward Between Two Ferns interview in the video above.

Charlottesville Mayor Calls For Removal Of Confederate Statues!/n

Good riddance!
As we reported, last week, a "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in a nearby park resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer when white nationalist James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.
Related: Michael Rapaport Brings Strong Take To Racist Neo-Nazis
Although the Charlottesville City Council voted this year to remove the statue and rename the location as Emancipation Park, a judge issued a temporary injunction in May preventing Virginia authorities from moving the Confederate symbol for six months.
However, Mayor Mike Signer (pictured above) is calling the shots, and he wants all the monuments — including the Lee effigy — to be gone!
The Democrat said in a statement: 
"With the terrorist attack, these monuments were transformed from equestrian statues into lightning rods… We can, and we must, respond by denying the Nazis and the KKK and the so-called alt-right the twisted totem they seek… And so for the sake of public safety, public reassurance, to magnify Heather's voice, and to repudiate the pure evil that visited us here, I am calling today for the removal of these Confederate statues from downtown Charlottesville."
Signer recently appeared on CNN where he told Anderson Cooper he has NOT received a call from President Donald Trump regarding the recent violent clashes in his city.
