Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
Santa came to say,

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love you, Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask you to stay
Close by me for ever, and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in your tender care
And fit us for heaven, to live with you there Away in a manger, no crib for a bed

Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Born a king on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Frankincense to offer have I.
Incense owns a Deity nigh.
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Myrrh is mine: Its bitter perfume
Breaths a life of gathering gloom.
Sorrow, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in a stone-cold tomb. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice.
Alleluia, alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Following yonder star. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,

Following yonder star! I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas Day. Hart now hear the angels sing
A king was born tonight
And man will live for ever
Because of Christmas Day. While shepherds watched their flock by
night,
They saw a bright new shining star
they hear a choir sing
The music seemed to come from afar. Hark, now hear the angels sing,
A king was born tonight
And man will live forever
Because of Christmas Day. Joseph and his wife, Mary,
Came to Bethlehem that night,
They found no place to bear her child,
Not a single room was in sight. Hart now hear the angels sing,
A king was born tonight
And man will live forever
Because of Christmas Day By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark,
Mary's little boy was born. Hart now hear the angels sing,
A king was born tonight
And man will live forever
Because of Christmas Day. What child is this, who, laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary. Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.
Nails, spears shall pierce him through,
the cross he bore for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
the Babe, the Son of Mary. So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own him.
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone him.
Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The babe, the Son of Mary. This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary. Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree!
Thy leaves are so unchanging
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Thy leaves are so unchanging Not only green when summer's here,
But also when it's cold and drear.
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Thy leaves are so unchanging! Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Such pleasure do you bring me!
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Such pleasure do you bring me! For every year this Christmas tree,
Brings to us such joy and glee.
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Such pleasure do you bring me! Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
You'll ever be unchanging!
A symbol of goodwill and love
You'll ever be unchanging Each shining light
Each silver bell
No one alive spreads cheer so well Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
You'll ever be unchanging O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, o night divine A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, o night divine Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful.
And since we've got no place to go,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I've brought some corn for popping.
The lights are turned way down low,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! When we finally kiss goodnight,
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But, if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm! The fire is slowly dying,
And my dear, we're still good-by-ing.
But, as long as you love me so,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I've brought some corn for popping,
Since the lights are turned way down low,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! When we finally say goodnight,
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But, if you'll really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm! Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
but the fire is so delightful.
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow, Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow! LET... IT ... SNOW! Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock,

"Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite,
With a tail as big as a kite." Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
"Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea,
With a voice as big as the sea." Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
"Do you know what I know?
In your palace walls, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold--
Let us bring him silver and gold,
Let us bring him silver and gold." Said the king to the people everywhere,
"Listen to what I say!
Pray for peace, people, everywhere,
Listen to what I say!
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light,
He will bring us goodness and light Frosty the Snowman, was a jolly happy soul,
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made of coal. Frosty the Snowman, is a fairytale, they say.
He was made of snow, but the children know he came to life one day. There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found, For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around! Oh, Frosty, the Snowman, was alive as he could be;
and the children say he could laugh and play,
just the same as you and me. Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
look at Frosty go. Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
over the hills of snow. Frosty the Snowman, knew the sun was hot that day,
so he said, "Let's run, and we'll have some fun now, before I melt away." Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there, all around the square,
sayin', "Catch me if you can." He led them down the streets of town, right to the traffic cop; and only paused a moment, when he heard him holler, "Stop!" For Frosty, the Snowman, had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye, sayin' "Don't cry, I'll be back again some day." Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
Over the hills of snow The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

on the feast of Stephen,
when the snow lay round about,
deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
though the frost was cruel,
when a poor man came in sight,
gathering winter fuel. Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
underneath the mountain,
right against the forest fence
by Saint Agnes fountain. Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
when we bear them thither.
Page and monarch, forth they went,
forth they went together
through the rude wind's wild lament
and the bitter weather. Sire, the night is darker now,
and the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how -
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps good, my page,
tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
freeze thy blood less coldly. In his master's step he trod,
where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
wealth or rank possessing,
ye who now will bless the poor
shall yourselves find blessing Oh little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel
Our Lord Emmanuel Here comes Santa Claus,
Here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane,
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer Pullin' on the reins.
Bells are ringin', children singin',
All is merry and bright.
So hang your stockings and say your prayers,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight. Here comes Santa Claus,
Here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane,
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again.
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,
Oh what a beautiful sight,
So jump in bed, and cover your head,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight. Here comes Santa Claus,
Here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane,
He'll come around when chimes ring out,
It's Christmas time again.
Peace on earth will come to all,
If we just follow the light,
So let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight. Here comes Santa Claus,
Here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane,
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pullin' on the reins.
Bells are ringin', children singin',
All is merry and bright,
So jump in bed, and cover your head,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight. Peace on earth will come to all,
If we just follow the light,
So let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight,
So let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight. While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around
And glory shone around.
"Fear not," said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled minds;
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind
To you and all mankind. "To you, in David's town, this day,
Is born of David's line
A Savior, who is Christ the Lord;
And this shall be the sign
And this shall be the sign.
The heavenly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swaddling-clothes
And in a manger laid
And in a manger laid." Thus spake the seraph and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels, praising God, and thus
Addressed their joyful song:
"All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good will henceforth from Heaven to men
Begin and never cease
begin and never cease." Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. She'd been drinking too much egg nog,
And we'd begged her not to go.
But she forgot her medication,
And she staggered through the door into the snow. When they found her Christmas morning,
At the scene of the attack.
She had hoof prints on her forehead,
And incriminating Claus marks on her back. Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. Now we're all so proud of Grandpa,
He's been taking this so well.
See him in there watching football,
Drinking beer and playing cards with cousin Mel. It's not Christmas without Grandma.
All the family's dressed in black.
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts or send them back? (send them back!) Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig.
And the blue and silver candles,
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig. I've warned all my friends and neighbours.
" Better watch out for yourselves."
They should never give a license,
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves. Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walking home from our house, Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.
Merry Christmas! It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door. A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again. It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart! God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy! From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tiding of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name. "Fear not, then," said the angel,
"Let nothing you affright;
This day is born a Savior
Of a pure virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might." Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
this holy tide of Christmas
Doth bring redeeming grace Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?
Donde está Santa Claus?
And the toys that he will leave.
Mamacita, oh, where is Santa Claus?
I look for him because it's Christmas Eve. I know that I should be the sleeping,
But maybe he's not far away,
So out of the window I'm peeping,
Hoping to see him in his sleigh. I hope he won't forget to clack his castanets,
And to his reindeer, say,
"Oh Pancho, Oh! Vixen, Oh! Pedro, Oh! Blitzen,"
Ole! Ole! Ole! San Ta Claus! Mamacita, donde está Santa Claus?
Oh! Where is Santa Claus?
It's Christmas Eve. I know that I should be sleeping,
But maybe he's not far away,
So out of the window I'm peeping,
Hoping to see him in sleigh. I hope he won't forget to crack his castanets,
And to his reindeer, say,
"Oh Pancho, Oh! Vixen, Oh! Pedro, Oh! Blitzen,"
Ole! Ole! Ole! San Ta Claus! Mamacita, donde está Santa Claus?
Oh! Where is Santa Claus?
It's Christmas Eve. Oh! Where is Santa Claus?
It's Christmas Eve. Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some
mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times,
many ways
Merry Christmas to you They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times,
many ways Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas to you Come they told me

Sweetly swinging o'er the plains

Echoing their joyous strains. Chorus:

Why your joyous strains prolong

Come, adore on bended knee,

Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth
Mary, Joseph lend your aid
With us sing our Savior's birth. While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks at night,
Behold throughout the heavens,
There shone a holy light:
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born. The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo! above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Saviour's birth:
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born. Down in a lowly manger
Our humble Christ was born
And God send us salvation,
That blessed Christmas morn':
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born. When I am a seeker,
I seek both night and day;
I seek the Lord to help me,
And He shows me the way:
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born. He made me a watchman
Upon the city wall,
And if I am a Christian,
I am the least of all.
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is born. I saw Mommy kissing santa claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night She didn't see me creep down the stairs to have a peep
she thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus underneath his beard so snowy white Oh what a laugh it would have been if Daddy had only seen mommy kissing santa claus last night

Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! The news had come out in the First World War
The bloody Red Baron was flying once more
The Allied command ignored all of its men
And called on Snoopy to do it again. Was the night before Christmas, 40 below
When Snoopy went up in search of his foe
He spied the Red Baron, fiercely they fought
With ice on his wings Snoopy knew he was caught. Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ring out from the land
Asking peace of all the world
And good will to man The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights
He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight
Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know
Or was it the bells from the village below. Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And good will to man The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine
And forced him to land behind the enemy lines
Snoopy was certain that this was the end
When the Baron cried out, "Merry Christmas, my friend!" The Baron then offered a holiday toast
And Snoopy, our hero, saluted his host
And then with a roar they were both on their way
Each knowing they'd meet on some other day. Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And good will to man (x3) Ding dong merrily on high,
In heav'n the bells are ringing:
Ding dong! verily the sky
Is riv'n with angel singing.
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis! E'en so here below, below,
Let steeple bells be swungen,
And "Io, io, io!"
By priest and people sungen.
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis! Pray you, dutifully prime
Your matin chime, ye ringers;
May you beautifully rime
Your evetime song, ye singers.
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis! You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel,
You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch,
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel! You're a monster, Mr. Grinch,
Your heart's an empty hole,
Your brain is full of spiders, you have garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch,
I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole! You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch,
You have termites in your smile,
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch,
Given a choice between the two of you I'd take the seasick crocodile! You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch,
You're the king of sinful sots,
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch,
You're a three decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce! You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch,
With a nauseous super "naus"!,
You're a crooked dirty jockey and you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch,
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful
Assortment of rubbish imaginable mangled up in tangled up knots! You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch,
You're a nasty wasty skunk,
Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch,
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote,
"Stink, stank, stunk"! Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say,
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day,
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway,
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright,
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night,
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way
To say "Merry Christmas to you." Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say,
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day,
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway,
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright,
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night,
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way
To say, "Merry Christmas,
A very Merry Christmas to you." Everybody stops
and stares at me
These two teeth are
gone as you can see
I don't know just who
to blame for this catastrophe!
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
is as plain as it can be! All I want for Christmas
is my two front teeth
my two front teeth
see my two front teeth! Gee if I could
have my two front teeth
then I could wish you
"Merry Christmas."
It seems so long since I could say,
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!" Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,
if I could only whistle (thhhh) All I want for Christmas
is my two front teeth,
my two front teeth,
see my two front teeth.
Gee, if I could only
have my two front teeth,
then I could wish you
"Merry Christmas." O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, o night divine A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices

That your baby boy will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God Mary, did you know?
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the Great I Am Oh Mary did you know? I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry?
Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell I ought to say no, no, no - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside I've got to get home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - Thrill when you touch my hand
Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me? There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
Oh, baby, it's cold outside
Oh, baby, it's cold outside Jolly old St. Nicholas, lean your ear this way
Don't you tell a single soul what I'm gonna say;
Christmas Eve is coming soon now you dear old man
Whisper what you'll bring to me; tell me if you can When the clock strikes twelve, when I'm fast asleep,
down the chimney broad and black with your pack you'll creep Then you'll find all the stockings hanging in a row,
Mine will be the smallest one I'm sure you will know, Johnny wants a pair of skates
Suzie wants a sled
Nellie wants a picture book yellow, blue, and red Now I think I'll leave to you what to give the rest,
Choose for me Dear Santa Claus; what you think is best. Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street

Somebody waits for you

Even more then I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me

And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams Twas the night before Christmas,
Da whole house was mella,
Not a creature was stirrin',
'cause I had a gun unda da pilla.
When up on da roof
I heard somethin' pound,
I sprung to da window,
To scream, "YO! Keep it down!"
When what to my
Wanderin' eyes should appear,
But da Don of all elfs,
And eight friggin' reindeer!
Wit' slicked back black hair,
And a silk red suit,
don Christopher wuz here,
And he brought da loot!
Wit' a slap to dare snouts,
And a yank on dare manes,
He cursed and he shouted,
And he called dem by name.
"Yo Tony, Yo Frankie,
Yo Vinny, Yo Vito,
Ay Joey, Ay Paulie,
Ay Pepe, Ay Guido!"
As I drew out my gun
And hid by da bed,
He flew troo da winda
And slapped me 'side da head.
"What da hell you doin'
Pullin' a gun on da Don?
Now all you're gettin' is coal,
You friggin' moron!"
Den pointin' a fat finga
Right unda my nose,
He twisted his pinky ring,
And up da chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh,
Obscenities screamin',
Away dey all flew,
Before he troo dem a beatin'.
Den I heard him yell out,
What I did least expect,
"Merry Friggin' Christmas to all,
And yous better show some respect!" Mary had a little lamb
One holy morning
'Neath the star of Bethlehem
A brand new day was forming
Guided by the shining light
And the angel's voice
Wise men traveled through the night
To see the baby boy 'Cause Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God They gathered 'round to see the lamb
In the manger sleeping
Such a humble throne for Him
The promise God was keeping
There the shepards bowed their heads
Among the cattle lowing
The first ever Christmas gift
Was wrapped in swaddling clothes Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God For the world a sacrifice
Mary did give birth
The way she held him in her arms
Is how He holds the earth Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God Oh, Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God Jesus our brother kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the friendly beasts around him stood
Jesus our brother kind and good "I" said the donkey shaggy and brown
I carried his mother up hill and down
I carried him safely to Bethlehem town
"I" said the donkey shaggy and brown And "I" said the cow all white and red
I gave him my manger for a bed
I gave him my hay for to pillow his head
"I" said the cow all white and red "I" said the sheep with a curly horn
I gave him my wool for his blanket warm
And he wore my coat on that Christmas morn
"I" said the sheep with a curly horn "I" said the dove from the rafters high
Cooed him to sleep that he should not cry
We cooed him to sleep my love and I
"I" said the dove from the rafters high And "I" said the camel all yellow and black
Over the desert upon my back
I brought him a gift in the wise men's pack
"I" said the camel all yellow and black Thus every beast remembering it well
In the stable dark was so proud to tell
Of the gifts that they gave Emmanuel
The gifts that they gave Emmanuel Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?
Mary Did you know
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary Did you know
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little boy
You've kissed the face of God Mary, did you know?
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary Did you know
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the Great I Am Out of all the reindeers
You know you're the mastermind

Threw his old pack right over his back
Opened the windows of his little shack
And shouted "Oh Dasher and Dancer
Vixen and Blizten come on here
We're gonna get a-goin' and spread some cheer
So limber your legs and sharpen your hooves
'Cause tonight is the night
We're gonna jump on the roof Well the reindeer they were so proud and grand
To take another trip all over the land
They jumped right into their proper place
To get hepped up for that midnight race Ol' Santa he shook off the ice and snow
Boarded his sleigh and then yelled "let's go"
All the little toys were happy too
Because they were so bright and new
A little piano then started to play
Santa began to swing and sway
Thought he heard a toy drum startin' to beat
But he found it was the rhythm of the reindeer feet The reindeer boogied in the middle of the road
Tonight we have a mighty big load
Don't boogie to the left now boogie to the right
Do the reindeer boogie this Christmas Eve night The reindeer boogied in the middle of the road
Tonight we have a mighty big load
Don't boogie to the left now boogie to the right
Do the reindeer boogie this Christmas Eve night Santa had a cup of coffee
And he ate a little snack
Mmm-hmmmm, mmm-hmmmm

Mmm-hmmmm, mmm-hmmmm (Alan Jackson) Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the hearts of all people both near and afar
Christmas everywhere
Feel the love of the season wherever you are
On the small country roads lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere Let it be Christmas everywhere
With the gold and the silver, the green and the red
Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow
Elderlys' memories that never grow old Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing and the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means and what we believe
From the sandy white beaches where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear

And it drank drank drank
But it kept on getting drier
Now it burns burns burns
This tree's on fire
This tree's on fire June call 9-1-1
June
Ohhh The heat from the smokin' pine
Melted my copy of Walk The Line
And I tried to save A Boy Named Sue
Dang it cooked him too The cat walked in
Set my Christmas tree on fire
He climbed climbed climbed
Hit some bulbs
And stripped the wires
:(Meows)
:That's when I learned learned learned
This tree's on fire

And I huffed and huffed and spit
But the flames would not expire

Santas on his way Santas on his way
Santas on his way Well I've been sorta worried
About Santa Claus this year
Cause we live way down south
And it didn't snow down here
But I'm telling you not to worry
Cause I just got the word
Everybody listen closely
And I'll tell you what I heard Santa's comin in a pickup
Instead of his trusty sleigh
He'll have a truck instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
Cause the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see Santa's gonna come in a pickup truck
When he visits you and me Santa can't bring his reindeer
He'll leave them far away
But don't you worry 'bout him
He's gonna be here Christmas day
He's got a big red pickup
With four-wheel drive and all
And there's gonna be a Merry Christmas
A Merry Christmas for all Santa's gonna come in a pick up truck
When he visits you and me Rumors emanating
From the North to all the Poles
Outsiders speculating
Who's designing Santa's clothes
He's the newest face in Christmas
And soon the world will know
That Rudolph's nose
Is not the only reindeer appendage that glows... Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa should he call him queer He's standing tall
Against the wall
Of prejudice and fear
He's Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer Well he came out of the forest
And that's why he's on the news
And ever since that legislation's changed
Now they can't make poor Stephon
Join in all those stupid stupid reindeer games Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa should he call him queer Prancer up in front of him
He's got Blitzen to the rear
He's Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer He's embarrassed by his antlers
He retains progesterone
And in his mind he looks like Doris Day
And if the health plan springs for surgery
Some day
You know he really may Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa should he call him queer He's standing tall
Against the wall
Of prejudice and fear
He's Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer Affirmative reaction
The world is on it's ear
Hey that speech that Jesse Jackson made
Brought Rush Limbaugh to tears
And he'll go down in history
For months or even years
He's Stephon
(Stephon)
The alternative lifestyle reindeer. Oh, the fire's burning slow
Now where's that mistletoe
Dear, it's getting kind of hot in here
I need a taste of Christmas cheer
I hope he gets here quick, I need a St. Nick fix
Oooo-eee, I just want him to be all wrapped up for me
Santa's never been this hard to resist
But Santa never used to look like this He's traded in his reindeer for a limosine
He's wearing purple trousers instead of red and green
This Christmas I want something I never had
Cause Santa's got a brand new bag Now, I got to got to find out how
To make him want to settle down
I've got a big fat kiss right at the top of my list
So we can build a little candy home
And have a few elves of our own
I want to sneak a peek at my surprise
And see tradition metamorphasize He's given up the cookies and he's slimming down
He bought a little bungalow in Tinsel Town
This Christmas I want something I never had
Cause Santa's got a brand new bag As he finds his Zen down on the kitchen floor
He lights a fat Cohiba from his humidor
This Christmas I want something I never had Cause Santa's got a brand new bag He's got a Richenbacher and he's bleached his hair
He's rockin to the rythm with a Latin flair
This Christmas I want something I've never had
Cause Santa's got a brand new bag He's reading Socrates and cooking French cuisine
He's pictured on the front of money magazine
This Christmas I want something I've never had
Cause Santa's got a brand new
Santa's got, Santa's got a brand new bag Last night I dreamed I was kid again
All the things I used to do I went and did again
Spent the afternoon with my best and closest friend
Wanderin' through the days we thought would never end
It was back when I'd still get things from Santa Claus
Back when he believed in me and overlooked the flaws
That can grow inside until it hides the perfect little boy inside the man I'm not a kid anymore, but I still believe that those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves still make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys Tonight I'll climb back in that bed again
Try to live out all my dreams inside my head again
After Christmas Eve with my best and closest friend
Who still believes the world's greatest dad just tucked him in
And I know that he'll be looking out for Santa Claus
And I'm sure beyond a doubt he'll overlook the flaws
That will grow inside until it hides this perfect little boy inside a man I'm not a kid anymore and I still believe that miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves do make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys Come they told me
A newborn King is born
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King
So to honor Him
pa rum pum pum pum
When we come Baby Jesus
I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King
Shall I play for you on my drum Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my best for Him
Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum Old Mr. Kringle is soon gonna jingle

Hell make this December the one youll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybodys waiting, theyre all congregating
Waiting for the man with the bag Better watch out now! A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was travelling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolks brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense
And perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring She waited till just before midnight
So no one would see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door and let me see
Though she trembled, she did as He asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring up into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offerings was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song Ribbons and paper cover the floor, it's been a great Christmas with presents galore
Everyone's happy and I'm happy, too
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you Frost on the window, snow on the ground, holiday spirit, holiday sounds
Everyone's thankful and I'm thankful, too
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you It all started underneath that mistletoe when we were waiting up just to help ole Santa Claus
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of
When we heard those sleigh bells and ole Santa almost caught us We didn't take no pictures,
But I still remember one very special twenty-fourth day of December
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
It all started underneath that mistletoe while we were waiting up to help ole Santa Clause
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of
When we heard those sleigh bells and ole Santa almost caught us If we don't do this nect year, honey, I'm sure gonna miss it
Why don't we make it a new Yuletide tradition
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you The city's decorated up for Christmas
All the stores are open late tonight
People hurry through the frozen streets
I take a walk Every child has a thousand wishes
Every window has a thousand lights
Every soul has a need for peace
I take a walk There's a star that still outshines the night
You can find it if you close your eyes
And see the light Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem Every night another tv special
Merchants counting down the shopping days
But something's missing underneath the tree
I take a walk 'Cause every heart longs for more than tinsel
Something more than just a holiday
Come and celebrate the baby King
Let's take a walk You don't have to travel anywhere
Faith and hope and love will bring you there
Bring you there Take a walk (take a walk) through Bethlehem
Come and kneel (come and kneel) before the Lamb
Good news for every man

Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "yoo hoo",
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, gidd yap,
It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you. There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop. pop! pop! pop! There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffe and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Iives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives! Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "yoo hoo",
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you. It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. The first Nowell, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep. Nowell, Nowell,
Nowell, Nowell,
Born is the King of Israel. They looked up and saw a Star,
Shining in the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth, it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night. Nowell, Nowell,
Nowell, Nowell,
Born is the King of Israel. The star drew nigh to the North-West,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did, both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay. Nowell, Nowell,
Nowell, Nowell,
Born is the King of Israel.
(Last time) Nowell, Nowell,
Nowell, Nowell I see the lights of the city tonight and I see a star shinin' so bright
A babe in a manger in swaddling clothes, it's you, it's me everyone knows The Christmas spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere
Like the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been coming down I hear the sound of church bell ring, and I see kids and grown-ups sing
A real live nativity scene, it's you, it's me, we all know what it means The Christman spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere
Like the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been coming down An it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King
It's time for that eastern star to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time Yes, it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King
It's time for that eastern start to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time Since the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been coming down Sweet little Jesus boy
They made you be born in a manger
Sweet little holy child
We didn't know who you were
Didn't know you'd come to save us Lord
To take our sins away
Our eyes were blind, we could not see
We didn't know who you were Long time ago
You were born
Born in a manger Lord
Sweet little Jesus boy
The world treats you mean Lord
Treats me mean too
But that's how things are down here
We don't know who you are You have told us how
We are trying
Master you have shown us how
Even when you were dying
Just seems like we can't do right
Look how we treated you
But please Sir forgive us Lord
We didn't know it was you Sweet little Jesus boy
Born a long time ago
Sweet little holy child
We didn't know who you were Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you On a cold night, late December
As the snow fell to earth
That's the one night, we remember
When a woman gave birth
And for miles and miles around
The baby's cry was the only sound Did He know the world was filled with pain
Could He feel all the hunger and the shame
Or did He know about the way He would die
And the reason why
Is that what made the baby cry?
Is that what made the baby cry? As his Mother turned to hold Him
Her face filled with joy
He grew quiet when She told Him
He was more than just her baby boy
And for miles and miles around
Her lullaby was the only sound Did She know the world was filled with pain
Could She feel all the hunger and the shame
Or did She know about the way He would die
And the reason why
Is that what made Her baby cry?
Is that what made Her baby cry? And as He fell asleep
She wiped away His tears
But the question still remains
Have we changed in two thousand years Don't you know the world is still in pain
Can't you feel all the hunger and the shame
Did we forget about the way that He died
And the reason why
Would we still make the baby cry?
Would we still make the baby cry? Come on weather man give us a forecast snowy white
Can't you hear the prayers of every childlike heart tonight
Rockies are callin', Denver snow fallin'
Somebody said it's four feet deep, but it doesn't matter
Give me the laughter, I'm gonna choose to keep Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only Chirstmas for me
Where the love circles around us like the gifts around our tree
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me Every now and then I get a wanderin' urge to see
Maybe California, maybe Tinsel Town's for me
There's a parade there, we'd have it made there
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve
Sure sounds exciting, awfully inviting, still I think I'm gonna keep Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only Christmas for me
Where the love circles around us like the gifts around our tree
Well they say in L.A. it's a warm holiday, it's the only place to be
A tender Tennessee Christmas, is the only Christmas for me Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me
A tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me It happened one day near December's end
Two neighbors called on an old friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with a thousand bows of green
And Conrad was sittin' with face ashined
When he suddenly stopped as he stiched a twine
And he said "Oh friends at dawn today
When the cock was crowin' the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And said 'I'm comin' your guest to be.'
So I've been busy with feet astir
And strewin' my shop with branches of fir
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined
Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear His step
As He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and look on His face"
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he'd known
For long since his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas day
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision he'd had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearin' a sound
But all he could see on the snow-covered ground
Was a shabby begger who's shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn
But Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said "You know, your feet must be frozen and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that'll keep you warmer too"
So with grateful heart, the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait
When he heard a knock he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent ol' lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindlin' piled on her back
She asked for only a place to rest
But that was reserved for Conrad's great guest
But her voice seemed to plead "Don't send me away
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas day"
So Conrad brewed her a steamin' cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup
But after she left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slippin' away
And the Lord hadn't come as He said He would
And Conrad felt sure he'd misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
"Please help me, and tell me where am I!"
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas day
Again, Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears
Then he led her back to her home once more
But as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not comin' today
For the hours of Christmas had passed away
So he went to his room and he knelt down to pray
And he said "Dear Lord, why did You delay?
What kept You from comin' to call on me?
For I wanted so much Your Face to see"
When soft in the silence, a voice he heard
"Lift up your head, for I kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
And three times I came to your lonely door
I was the begger with bruised, cold feet
And I was the woman you gave somethin' to eat
I was the child on the homeless street.
Three times I knocked and three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts love is the best
And I was honored to be your Christmas guest." My little boy was a wise man this year
His Christmas play was something I couldn't miss
Between the shopping and my job I barely got there
My faith was worn from stress and strain
Until those little Angels sang (hallelujah)
To the King (people rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the angels sang (hallelujah)
And they sang (people rejoice) And as I watched those innocent children
I felt the greatness of that holy night
And for a moment I was right there with those wise men
So overwhelmed with love and light I had to cry when the Angels sang (hallelujah)
To the King (people rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the angels sang (hallelujah)
And they sang (people rejoice) Angels sang (hallelujah)
To the King (people rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the angels sang (hallelujah)
And they sang (people rejoice) Hey, the old man's back in town

Ooooh.... On a night so long ago
By the light of one bright star
Two weary travelers far from Galilee
Took refuge in a stable
Where a little child was born
To bring the gift of love, to you and me
When the angels told the shepherds of His birth
There came a great rejoicing on the earth. And they sang, glory to God in the highest
Dawning that first Christmas morn
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy
For unto you this night a child is born. And, lo, these many years since then
That ancient star still guides us
And now again our Christmas voices ring
Blessed we are and safe at home
With loved ones her beside us
And in the still and silent night we sing
How the angels told the shepherds of his birth
And there came a great rejoicing on the earth And they sang, glory to God in the highest
Dawning that first Christmas morn
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy
For unto you this night a child is born. Now I'm only five years old
I've got to do just what I'm told
'cause Santa Claus is gonna be dropping in on me
Now is there something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree.
Now I know what he like for a late night snack
For years now it's been bringing him back
Milk and cookies
He'll come and go without a sound again
But how in the world does he get in
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
Try to sleep it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's Gone I just can't wait
Now is there something I might have missed I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can get it all under that Christmas tree.
Sneak a peek down the hall
I've got to check Now I don't recall
the milk and cookies
I think I'm sure I got it all
Stockings hung a-long the wall
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
I gotta sleep now it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's Gone I just can't wait
Just can't wait, just can't wait
Could there be something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree.
I hope he can fit it all under my Christmas tree. spoken:
Let's see, I know he can fit...he can fit the airplane under there.
He can get the bicycle in there and the...
And the gum ball machine and don't know what he's gonna do with that horse. What a merry Christmas this could be
If you would just come back to me
And say that you've forgiven me
What a merry Christmas this could be It was just last Christmas
That we quarreled and you walked out
I knew I was wrong
But you'd come back
I had no doubt
Now a year has rolled around
It's Christmas once again
And what I'd give if you'd come walkin' in What a merry Christmas this could be
If you would just come back to me
And say that you've forgiven me
What a merry Christmas this could be What a merry Christmas this could be
If you would just come back to me
And say that you've forgiven me
What a merry Christmas this could be What a merry Christmas this could be Maybe its much too early in the game
Ah, but I thought Id ask you just the same
What are you doing New Years
New Years Eve? Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When its exactly twelve oclock that night
Welcoming in the New Year

When its exactly twelve oclock that night
Welcoming in the New Year
New Years Eve What are you doing New Years Eve? I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear the sleighbells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry
And bright
And may all your Christmases be white Well, I'm glad little Johnny wants that remote control
I know I'm gonna run it fast as it will go
And Jenny wants every game that Nintendo makes
It's just around the corner and I can't wait I've got my stocking hangin', it's time to go to bed
I think I hear some reindeer, I better cover up my head
I know Santa's gonna bring us something just like he always did
Yeah, when it comes to Christmas I'm still a kid I still like shakin' presents underneath the tree
And tryin' to figure out what ole Santa's got for me
Oh, I get so excited on Christmas Eve
I try my best to close my eyes, but I can't sleep Well, I've got my stocking hangin', its time to go to bed
I think I hear some reindeer, I better cover up my head
I know Santa's gonna bring us something just like he always did
Yeah, when it comes to Christmas I'm still a kid When it comes to Christmas, I'm still a kid
Just a kid Where are you Christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh

If you care, oh If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here in silence
Fills each and every heart with love Where are you Christmas
Fills your heart with love Got a wife and two kids, all gathered around
A twenty-pound turkey, snow on the ground
Who says there aint no Santa Claus Eric wants a glove, he tears into a box
His eyes are wide with wonder,
I sit back and watch
Who says there aint no Santa Claus I havent heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my childrens eyes and there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says theres no Santa Claus Molly gets a doll, Mommas camera clicks
Guess we all get the puppy, hes getting in his licks
Who says there aint no Santa Claus Im trying to read a card in crooked red and blue
Only part that really matters is "Daddy, we love you"
Who says there aint no Santa Claus I havent heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my childrens eyes and there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says theres no Santa Claus Hey, Ive heard there aint no Santa Claus
But I know theres got to be a Santa Claus She smiles at him, he says, "Hello"
They stand beneath the mistletoe
Embarrassed by the awkward circumstance He asks her if shed like a drink
She says, "I better not I think
Oh, what the heck, maybe just one glass" They talk about, oh, this and that
He says, "I like the way you laugh
And Im so really glad youre here" Then suddenly its much too warm
She feels his hand against her arm
The season loves the reason for romance
Itll get you if you give it half a chance The night goes on, the music plays
A moonlight Christmas serenade
A lovers song thats meant for only two And they dont even know it yet
But this is one theyll not forget The holiday where all their dreams came true
Across the floor he spins her around
Oh, could it be theyve finally found
A love worth waiting for Then in the tender yuletide bliss
They share an unexpected kiss
The season loves the reason for romance
Itll get you if you give it half a chance Then suddenly the night is gone
Its late into an early morn
The season loves the reason for romance
Itll get you if you give it half a chance Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock. The factories are all shut down and the shopping malls are all closed
And the busy streets are all empty except for the falling snow
And in the small towns, in the cities families gather as one
'Cause the night of love and sharing they look forward to has come 'Cause tonight is Christmas, tonight is love
Tonight we celebrate God's one and only Son
Tonight there's hope for peace on earth eternally
Tonight is Christmas and the world's in harmony But across the seas two armies stare down at each other's guns
Each believing in their cause enough to die or kill the other one
But tonight there'll be no shooting, not a drop of blood will spill
They will cease their fire this silent night in the name of peace and goodwill 'Cause tonight is Christmas, tonight is love
Tonight we celebrate God's one and only Son
Tonight there's hope for peace on earth eternally
Tonight is Christmas and the world's in harmony One day a mother went to a prison
To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done She did not bring to him
A parole or pardon (free)
She brought no silver (brought no gold)
No pomp nor style (longed to see)
It was a halo bright
Sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile She left a smile you can remember
She's gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those walls around you could never change her
You were her baby and ere will be She did not bring to him
A parole or pardon (free)
She brought no silver (brought no gold)
No pomp nor style (longed to see)
It was a halo bright
Sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile It was a halo bright
Sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile We were alone in the fields with our sheep
A star in the sky glowing bright in the east
When an angetlic choir singing all glory be
To God in the highest, bade us come see (they said) The way in a manger is a babe fast asleep
He's never a stranger to wise men who seek
The light and the hope for all of mankind
He's the way in the manger
And He's easy to find Mary and Joseph were there when we came
And all that the angels had said was the same
And when I saw the baby I knew just what to do
I bowed down to worship the light and the truth The way in a manger is a babe fast asleep
He's never a stranger to wise men who seek
The light and the hope for all of mankind
He's the way in the manger
And He's easy to find The light and the hope
For all of mankind
He's the way in a manger
And He's easy to find When you said that yesterday
That it's nearly Christmas
What did I want

'Cause no matter how far away you roam
If you long for the sunshine and a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home I met a man who lived in Tennessee
And he was looking for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
Now in Pennsylvania folks are traveling
Down to Dixie's sunny shore
The Atlantic to Pacific

When an angel of the Lord
Said, "Seek the Savior born"
Logic told them they were crazy
They shouldn't even try
The followed their hearts, they followed that star
This Christmas, let me be that wise 2,000 years ago, Mary left her home
An angel said, "Have faith"
The Lord will light your way
The road was long and winding
But a promise had been made
>From heaven above, that was enough
This Christmas, let me keep that faith This Christmas, let this be the season
Of peace and love, joy and true believing
2,000 years ago, as everybody knows
A perfect baby lay
Asleep there in the hay
The world would not believe Him
But he loved them all so much
On that first night, He was the light
This Christmas, let me feel that love Keep that faith, be that wise, feel that love
This Christmas Presents underneath the tree
Candles burning bright
Stockings hung with lots of care
On this silent Christmas night
What makes this season magical
Is what made my dream come true
Just seeing you
To be here with you Oh this Christmas time

The greatest gift in life
Is you and me together
And I thank heaven for sending you here tonight
This Christmas time Some people hope for rings of gold
All that money buys

Short fuses, long lines, so much for a silent night
Then magically we all wake up

And find ourselves here in our own Tinseltown
Where everything glitters
Tinseltown
All sparkle and shimmer
Look around and see the brightest stars come out
In Tinseltown, in Tinseltown Three King manger scene, glowing on the front lawn

Tinsel all the way (Dolly Parton) I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
I've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories brought joy to other's lives
It's Christmas time again another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing jingle bells around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down this Christmas I'll be home I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on (Dolly Parton) I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I'll tell you why I do
'Cause I believe that dreams and plans and wishes can come true
I believe in miracles, I believe in magic too
Oh I believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you I believe in family, in country and in smiles
I believe in turnin' negatives to positives in life
I believe in lookin' farther up the farther down we get
I believe when someone hurts us we should forgive and forget And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe love should prevail at any cost
And I believe in Santa Claus I believe in saying what you mean and meaning what you say
I believe a better attitude can make a better way
And I believe in viewing life as a journey that we're on
And lookin' at our troubles as another stepping stone And I believe that everything in life is what it's meant to be
I believe there is a God somewhere although he's hard to see
I believe I am so therefore I should do all that I can
To be a better piece in the puzzle of God's plan And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus Let the little children sing it I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus

It's the middle of December there's excitement eveywhere Everyone's invited, the celebration's planned
The gift is just what's in your heart and not what's in your hand Who's the one we need to thanks
Who's the party for
Who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joesph and Mary's boy There were times we didn't think we'd make it through the year
The bankers tried to take our farms but somehow we're still here I don't know how the crops survived the drought and then the rain
It must have been a miracle how else could you explain Who's the one we need to thanks
Who's the party for
Who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joesph and Mary's boy The Christ Child born in Bethlehem
He was Joesph and Mary's boy Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing. Joy to the world, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy. No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found. He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders, of His love. Well you've all heard the story
About Rudolph and his nose
Well I'll tell you a Christmas tell
That never has been told
Well you may think you've heard it all
But you ain't heard nothin' yet
About that crazy Christmas
That the North Pole can't forget Rudolph was under the weather
And had to call in sick
So he got on the horn
To his cousin Leroy
Who lived out in the sticks
He said Santa's really counting on me
And I hate to pass the buck
Leroy said Hey I'm on my way
And he jumped in his pick-up truck
When Leroy got to the North Pole
All the reindeer stiggered and laughed
They never seen a deer in overalls
And a John Deer tracktor hat
Well Santa stepped in
And said just calm down
Cuz we all got a job to do
Like it or not Leroy's in charge
And he's gonna be leading you
And it was Leroy The Redneck Reindeer
Hooked to the front of the sleigh
Delivering toys to all the good ol' boys
And girls along the way
He's just a down home party animal
Two Steppin all across the sky
He makes jingle bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night Before that night was over
Leroy had changed there tune
He had them scootin a holf
On every single roof
By the light of a neon moon
Santa wrapped his bad with the dixie flag
He as having the time of his life
You could here him call
Merry Chistmas Yall
And all of yall a goodnight
And it was Leroy The Redneck Reindeer
Hooked to the front of the sleigh
Delivering toys to all the good ol' boys
And girls along the way
He's just a down home party animal
Two Steppin all across the sky
He makes jingle bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night He makes Jingle Bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong The weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Oh, since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Well it doesn't show signs of stopping
But we've got some corn for popping
And the lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But as long as you hold me tight
Woah all the way home I'll be warm Well the fire is slowly dying
But my dear we're still goodbye-ing
And as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow (let it snow)
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow (let it snow) When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But as long as you hold me tight
Hoah all the way home I'll be warm Oh the fire is slowly dying
But my dear we're still goodbye-ing
And as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow (let it snow)
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Thru the deep snows of uncertain winter descending
With Joseph I wander, with Mary I ride
Toward the promise that waits
At their harsh journey's ending
Those of humble estate shall in mansions abide Sprinkle some glitter on magazine angels
Use matchsticks and clothespins to build Bethlehem
Make the star in the East from a piece of tin foil
Look for the child within
Let Jesus be born again Now who will be greatest in the kingdom of Heaven
The least of all children, the greatest shall be
So turn not away from the poor and forgotten
And always remember, his favorites are these Sprinkle some glitter on magazine angels
Use matchsticks and clothespins to build Bethlehem
Make the star in the East from a piece of tin foil
Look for the child within
Let Jesus be born again The gifts that we bring unto loved ones and strangers
Also we bring to the babe in the manger So come all ye faithfull, ye shepherds and kings
Look for the child within
Let Jesus be born again
Let Jesus be born again (Toby Keith ) You should see all the lights in our old neighborhood
I never thought that little street could ever look so good
I knew that she'd be busy, it's her favorite time of the year
And I don't think she notice, I slipped off to be here Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
God knows if she could see us now, she wouldn't understand
But Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to take that chance Don't the snow sure look pretty, as the flakes are fallin' down
It's a blanket from heaven coverin' the ground
And that cold wind can cut a man clear to the bone
I guess it's time I got up and took myself back home Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
God knows if she could see us now, she wouldn't understand
But Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to take that chance Well, she's started askin' questions
Though she's barely two
Like, if reindeer fly to heaven
Would Santa bring her love to you Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
Someday we'll be together forever, but till then
But Mary, it's Christmas, and Ill do the best I can This cold wind can cut a man clear to the bone
I guess it's time I got up off my knees and took myself back home Mom got drunk and Dad got drunk
At our Christmas party
We were drinkin' champagne punch
And homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him
Til he sang Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife Lynn
And the two identical twins
From his second wife Mary Nell
Of course he brought his new wife Kaye
Who talks all about AA
Chain smokin' while the stereo plays
Noel, Noel, The first Noel Carve the turkey turn the ball game on
Mix Margaritas when the eggnog's gone
Send somebody to the Quik-Pak store
We need some ice and an extension cord
A can of bean dip and some Diet Rite
A box of pampers , some Marlboro Lights
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family Fran and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motor home in
They blew our christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited on our front lawn
He threw the breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night
Oh Silent Night o' holy night Carve the turkey turn the ballgame on
Mix Bloody Marys cause we all want one
Send somebody to the Stop 'n Go
We need some celery and a can of fake snow
A bag of lemons and some Diet Sprite
A box of midol, some Salem Lights
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family Twas the fight before Christmas
When all through the house
No furniture left standing, no TV or couch
Our aquarium, heck they even knocked over my Chia Pet
MeMaw was flung 'cross the room by her hair
By her sister Ethel who never fought fair LET'S GET READY TO TUMBLE!!!!!!! The children all wrestled and jumped off the beds
Dropping elbows and knees on each other's heads
And MaMaw wth her frying pan and Pa with his bat
Cleared half the room in ten seconds flat
The whole brawl began from an innocent matter
When Aunt Flo thought Eugene said "She looks a whole lot fatter"
She knocked him through the window he fell with a crash
Tore down the gutters and busted his LEG REALLY BAD You ought to have saw it
It looked like he'd been in a motorcycle wreck
No Kiddin
Yeah awful I couldn't turn to look at it You see both sides of our family have never gotten along
And every holiday something always go wrong
You ain't supposed to fight but spread joy in this season
But when they get the nog they just look for a reason
In no time at all everybody joined in
And right there we squared off with our closest of kin
It's a time for givin said Uncle Bill
As he gave a black eye to his brother-in-law Phil
I heard somebody say "It's the thought that counts
And right now I'm thinking about knocking your butt out"
Presents and fists flew all over the room
And NaNa had some fancy moves with the broom
She took out three cousins and knocked down the tree
And I ducked just in time she swung out at me It's my favorite time of year
Dad always has too much beer
Gets on the roof and hunts reindeer
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Tie the antlers on the dog
Save some shine for Santa Claus
From all the in-laws and outlaws
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily I crawled to the phone Lord it seemed like a mile
And called 9-1-1 which we keep on speed dial
In a matter of minutes out the window appeared
Flashing blue lights and the Sherrif John Deere
Just then six men burst through the door
Some yelling "HAND'S UP" Some "GET ON THE FLOOR"
A stray punch from Grandpa found the sherrif's chin
And just for good measure he clocked him again
It took all 6 cops to get Grandpa in cuffs
You know he gets feisty when he runs out of snuff
We all stopped our fighting and cheered Grandpa on
Heck I thought he could take them I guess I was wrong
As they dragged him outside he yelled "I'VE BEEN FRAMED"
He was kicking and screaming and calling them names "You (bleep) You (bleep)
Let me go you (bleep)
You donut eatin stupid (bleep) son of a (bleep)" We stood on the porch as did all our neighbras
Who always took interest in our family's behavior
"Mind your own business" we heard Grandma shout
And "We'll take back the presents and then come bail you out"
By now we'd forgotten what we were fighting for
We were battered and bruised but united once more
Then we all joined hands and sang "Violent Night" Violent Night And we heard Grandpa exclaim as they drove off out of sight:
"Merry Christmas to all...MAN that was a good fight!!!!" Deck your neighbor deck the halls
Tis the season for a brawl
From all of us to all of y'all
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Layin' back in my easy chair
Late last Christmas eve
Silent night, twinkling lights
Presents 'round the tree
I heard my little girl's two bare feet
Comin' down the stairs
She was sad as I looked over
Draggin' her teddy bear She said, now daddy, I had a dream
A little angel came down to me
She wasn't happy like angels ought to be
She was cryin' when she gave me the message
For all the world to hear
You know that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year So, with her head on my shoulder
And her tears mixed with mine
I thought how little baby Jesus
Gets left out at Christmas time
It ain't about the money
Oh, money can't buy love
And I saw the light that Christmas night
With help from up above She said, now daddy, I had a dream
A little angel came down to me
She wasn't happy like angels ought to be
She was cryin' when she gave me the message
For all the world to hear
You know that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year She said that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year Tree's in the corner, the fire's burnin' bright.
Shadows are dancin' in the pale candelight.
Life should be a rainbow, but it's blue:
It won't be Christmas without you. I wrapped up all your presents,
Wrote my name on every card.
I just can't help it, baby,
Takin' this so hard.
You tell me: what's a man to do?
'Cause it won't be Christmas without you. I stare into the flames: all I see is your face.
All this joy an' happiness seems so out of place.
As far as I'm concerned, it's just a day I must get through.
But it won't be Christmas without you. Oh, I wrapped up all your presents,
Wrote my name on every card.
I just can't help it, baby,
I'm takin' this so hard.
You tell me: what's a man to do?
It won't be Christmas without you. Oh, I wrapped up all your presents,
Wrote my name on every card.
I just can't help it, baby,
I'm takin' this so hard.
You tell me: what's a man to do?
It won't be Christmas without you. It won't be Christmas without you. He was her man, she was his wife
And late one winter night
He knelt by her
As she gave birth
But it wasn't his child
It wasn't his child Yet still he took him as his own
And as he watched him grow
It brought him joy
He loved that boy
But it wasn't his child
It wasn't his child But like a father
He was strong and kind and good
And I believe he did his best
It wasn't easy for him
But he did all he could
His son was different from the rest
It wasn't his child
It wasn't his child And when the boy became a man
He took his father's hand
And soon the world all know why
It wasn't his child
It wasn't his child And like his father
He was strong and kind and good
And I believe he did his best
It wasn't easy for him
But he did all he could
He grew up with his hands in wood
And He died with his hands in wood
He was God's child
He was God's child He was her man, she was his wife
And late one winter night
He knelt by her
As she gave birth
But it wasn't his child
It wasn't God's child (George Strait) "This the season for generosity
A time to give and to receive
My Christmas list consists of just one sweet dream.... I know what I want for Christmas this year
I hope my note got to Santa on time
Im a little bit nervous,
Its kind of a big thing Im asking for
I dont know if I deserve it but, boy, if I get it
Ill never ask for anything more
It shines, its new
And its the one wish that I wish would come true
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you We can build a little fire
We can sit and talk for hours
Well just have fun
You can tell me what you did
Christmas morning as a kid
And well talk about all our Christmases to come And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway
Im sure to get a kiss
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow
To complete this singular wish?
It shines, its new
I know what I want and nothin else will do
This year for Christmas I just want to be with you This year for Christmas I just want to be with you" (Alan Jackson) The snow is falling It's Christmas Eve

Little Shelby wears a funny smile on his face
Shelby has a secret
And the secret he must share
He wants to tell somebody
So he tells his teddy bear I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the misteltoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw Mama tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mama kissing Santa Claus last night I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the misteltoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw Mama tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mama kissing Santa Claus last night He raced that engine down the track 'round the tree on Christmas day
I was so amazed my dad would play with trains
I saw a sparkle in his eye,
Then I heard him say, come on son let's play, I was young once, too He washed that Buick faithfully, Lord he kept her clean
I thought that machine meant more to him than me
On the day I turned sixteen he threw me the keys
Said I was young once, too, now she belongs to you He was such a young man then, I'm older than that now
I hope I measure up to him, when the circle comes around I saw him in the attic sittin' cross legged on the floor
With some old photographs, he point and laughed
He said, that's me in that picture, I said, no son, that's your dad
I was young once, too, and looked a lot like you I was young once, too, I was young once, too
Merry Christmas son, I wish your grandpa were here
He was young once, too, and looked like me and you (Billy Gilman) I've gotta get a message off to Santa today
It's gettin' close to Christmas I've got something to say

Roof tops covered in snow
Lovers sharing a sleigh ride cuddled close
And their eyes seem to glow Window shopping on main street
Bundled up head to toe
Children are skating around a Christmas tree
I see smiles young and old If everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
If everyday could be Christmas Chruch bells ring in the distance
Peace on earth fills the air
Sidewalk Santas handing out candy canes
I feel love everywhere If everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
If everyday could be Christmas Oh it's that time
We open and give from our hearts
Let love shine brighter than any star Oh if everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
Oh if everyday could be Christmas
If everyday could be Christmas
Yeah if everyday could be Christmas
If everyday could be Christmas If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town
Come summer time
Maybe even California
If we make it through December
We'll be fine Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing's not the greatest
In the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right
For daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas here (Alan Jackson) Well I'm making out my list
For ole St.Nick tonight
But I'm afraid what I want this year
Can't be had But Santa he's the kind
When he makes up his mind
Wishes can come true
And I bet my Christmas stockin'
If my wish don't come knockin'
He's gonna be blue So baby come home
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry
He can't see where he's going
When it's snowing
If there tears in his eyes And don't you know his ho ho ho will be
A sad sad sigh
So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry And don't you know his ho ho ho will be
A sad sad sigh
So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry (Alan Jackson) Today I took some paper from the closet
And wrapped the wedding ring
You left behind
And I addressed it to the man
Who vowed to love you
And on the little card
I wrote these words inside Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me Then I sat down in my chair
And thought about you
About the many reasons why you're gone
And I opened up the present that I gave to me
And realized how much it hurts to be alone Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me Feliz Navidad

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring'
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight! Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh. A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot. A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away. Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead. Feliz Navidad

From depths of Hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave

And open wide our heavenly home I don't want a lot for Christmas

Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you. I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow

Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring'
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight! Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh. A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot. A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away. Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead. When Christ was born of Mary free,
In Bethlehem in that fair city,
Angels sung e'er with mirth and glee, [Chorus:]
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria. Herdmen beheld these angels bright-
To them appeared with great light,
And said, "God's son is born this night." [Chorus] This King is come to save His kind,
In the Scripture as we find People making lists
Buying special gifts
Taking time to be kind
To one and all
It's that time of year
When good friends
Are dear
And you wish you
Could give more
Than just presents
From a store Why don't you give love
On Christmas day

Oh, even the man
Who has everything
Would be so happy
If you would bring
Him love
On Christmas day
(On Christmas day)
No greater gift
Is there than love People you don't know
Smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air
Of Christmas joy
It's that once a year
When the world's sincere
And you'd like
To find a way
To show the things
That words can't say Why don't you give love
On Christmas day
(On Christmas day)
Oh the man on the street
And the couple upstairs
All need to know
That someone who cares

On Christmas day
(Christmas day) It's a marshmallow world in the winter,
When the snow comes to cover the ground,
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day,
I wait for it all year round. Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly,
In the arms of the evergreen trees,
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,
It's shining so your nose won't freeze. The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,
The world is your snowball just for a song,
Get out and roll it along. It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
Take a walk with your favourite girl,
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late,
In winter, it's a marshmallow world. The world is your snowball, see how it grows,

Get out and roll it along. It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down. When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Hey! Chingedy ching,

Chingedy ching,

The Italian Christmas donkey.
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)
Santa's got a little friend,
His name is Dominick.
The cutest little donkey,
You never see him kick.
When Santa visits his paisans,
With Dominick he'll be.
Because the reindeer cannot,
Climb the hills of Italy. Hey! Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
It's Dominick the donkey.
Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
The Italian Christmas donkey.
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da) Jingle bells around his feet,
And presents on the sled.
Hey! Look at the mayor's derby,
On top of Dominick's head.
A pair of shoes for Louie,
And a dress for Josephine.
The labels on the inside says,
They're made in Brooklyn. Hey! Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
It's Dominick the donkey.
Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)

And Dominick starts to dance.
They talk Italian to him,
And he even understands. Cumpare sing,
Cumpare su,
And dance 'sta tarantel.

(Hee-haw, hee-haw) [Verse 1]
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day.
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.
O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me. [Chorus]
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump,
Look at Frosty go.
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump,
Over the hills of snow. [Verse2]
Ooh Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day,
So he said, "Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away."
Down to the village,
With a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all
Around the square saying,
Catch me if you can.
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"
Mmm Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,
"Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some day." [Chorus]
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump,
Look at Frosty go.
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump Over the hills of snow You know Dasher and prancer
And Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen.
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all? Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(reindeer)
Had a very shiny nose
(like a light bulb)
And if you ever saw it
(saw it)
You would even say it glows
(like a flash light)
All of the other reindeer
(reindeer)
Used to laugh and call him names
(like Pinochio)
They never let poor Rudolph
(Rudolph)
Play in any reindeer games
(like Monopoly) Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
(Ho Ho Ho)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then all the reindeer loved him
(loved him)
And they shouted out with glee
(yippee)
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(reindeer)
You'll go down in history!"
(like Columbus) Jesus, Jesus
Oh
What a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life, new hope
New joy He brings
Won't you listen
To the angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King Jesus, Jesus

New life, new hope

They were guided
Bby a shining star
To see King Jesus
Where He lay
In a manger
Filled with hay Jesus, Jesus

So if Santa brings that sleigh (Santa brings that sleigh)
All along the Milky Way (along the Milky Way)

Then he may decide to stay Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day

Underneath the mistletoe last night.
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought I was tucked
Up in my bedroom fast asleep. Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white.
Oh, what a laugh it would have been,
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night! C'est la belle nuit de Noel
La neige etend son manteau blanc
Et les yeux leves vers le ciel
A genoux, les petits enfants
Avant de fermer les paupieres
Font une derniere priere. [Refrain:]
Petit papa Noel
Quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.
Mais avant de partir
Il faudra bien te couvrir
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid
C'est un peu a cause de moi. Il me tarde que le jour se leve
Pour voir si tu m'as apporte
Tous les beaux joujoux que je vois en reve
Et que je t'ai commandes. [Refrain:]
Petit papa Noel
Quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.
Mais avant de partir
Il faudra bien te couvrir
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid
C'est un peu a cause de moi. Le marchand de sable est passe
Les enfants vont faire dodo
Et tu vas pouvoir commencer
Avec ta hotte sur le dos
Au son des cloches des eglises
Ta distribution de surprises. Et quand tu seras sur ton beau nuage
Viens d'abord sur notre maison
Je n'ai pas ete tous les jours tres sage
Mais j'en demande pardon. [Refrain]:
Petit papa Noel
Quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.
Mais avant de partir
Il faudra bien te couvrir
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid
C'est un peu a cause de moi. (French carol, ca. 1862) Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply,
Echoing their joyous strains.
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o Shepherds, why this Jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o Hark! how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say,
"Throw cares away."

Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air. What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock. [Verse 1]
Joy to the World, the Lord has come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing. [Verse 2]
Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy. [Verse 3]
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found. [Verse 4]
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared
And the soul felt its worth
The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, o night divine O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error-pining
Till he appeared
And the soul felt it's worth
The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, o night divine Said the night wind to the little lamb,
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
Do you see what I see
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song, high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
Do you know what I know
In your palace wall, mighty king,
Do you know what I know
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold Said the king to the people everywhere,
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere!
Listen to what I say
The Child, the Child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light Angels from the realms of glory
Wing your flight over all the earth
Ye, who sang creations story
Now proclaim Messiah's birth
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King Shepherds in the fields abiding
Watching over your flocks by night
God with man is now residing
Yonder shines the Infant light
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King Sages leave your contemplations
Brighter visions beam afar
Seek the great Desire of nations
Ye have seen His natal star
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King Saints before the alter bending
Watching long in hope and fear
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King On the first day of Christmas

Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me. I really can't stay (Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go way (Baby, it's cold outside)
The evening has been (I've been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hand, they're just like ice) My mother will start to worry (Hey beautiful, what's your hurry)
And father will be pacing the floor (Listen to that fireplace roar)
So really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
Well, maybe just a half a drink more (Put some music on while I pour) The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink (No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell) I oughtta say no, no, no sir (You mind if I move in closer)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (And what's the sense in hurting my pride)
I really cant stay (Oh baby, don't hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside I simply must go (It's cold outside)
The answer is no (Baby, it's cold outside)
The welcome has been (So lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm) My sister will be suspicious (Your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Like waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh your lips are delicious)
Well maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before) I've got to get home (Baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
Oh, but don't you see (How can you do this thing to me) There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Making my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia)
I really cant stay (Get over that old out)
Oh, but baby its cold outside Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born Down in a lowly manger
Our humble Christ was born
And God send us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born Bridge: There's something ' bout Christmas time
Something ' bout Christmas time
We're gonna talk about the manger
and sing about the Savior
Knowing that it's Christmas time. (X2) Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born Mary, did you know

When you kiss your little Baby you kiss the face of God? Mary did you know.. Mary did you know The blind will see.
The deaf will hear.
The dead will live again.
The lame will leap.
The dumb will speak
The praises of The Lamb. Mary did you know Mary, did you know
that your Baby Boy is Lord of all creation? Mary, did you know
that your Baby Boy would one day rule the nations? Did you know
that your Baby Boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
The sleeping Child you're holding is the Great, I Am. Mary did you know Dashing through the snow

Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made of coal Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made out of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, Let's run and have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying Catch me if you can He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler stop Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', Please don't cry
I'll be back again some day Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o're the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo Shepherds why this Jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo Come to Bethlehem to see
him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo See him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo Silent night, Holy night, All is calm, All is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia;
Christ the Savior, is born!
Christ the Savior, is born! Silent night, Holy night,
Son of God, Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth. O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder brings a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error-pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder brings a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine (Rebecca Lynn Howard) The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down. When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland. (Tom T. Hall) O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy leaves are so unchanging;
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy leaves are so unchanging;
Not only green when summer's here,
But also when 'tis cold and drear.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy leaves are so unchanging! O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Much pleasure thou can'st give me;
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Much pleasure thou can'st give me;
How often has the Christmas tree
Afforded me the greatest glee!
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Much pleasure thou can'st give me. O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy candles shine so brightly!
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy candles shine so brightly!
From base to summit, gay and bright,
There's only splendor for the sight.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy candles shine so brightly! O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
How richly God has decked thee!
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
How richly God has decked thee!
Thou bidst us true and faithful be,
And trust in God unchangingly.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
How richly God has decked thee! !" Away in a manger,
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay. The cattle are lowing
The Baby awakes
The little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
til morning is nigh. Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray.
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us for heaven
To live with Thee there. Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels; O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,

Lo, he shuns not the Virgin's womb;
Son of the Father, begotten, not created; O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,

Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!

Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;
We too will thither bend our joyful footsteps; O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord. Child, for us sinners poor and in the manger,
We would embrace Thee, with love and awe;
Who would not love Thee, loving us so dearly? O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning;
Jesus, to Thee be glory given;
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing. O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord. (Brenda Lee) Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly" Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly" Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way (Chely Wright) Oh the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I've bought some corn for popping,
The lights are turned way down low,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! When we finally kiss goodnight,
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm. The fire is slowly dying,
And, my dear, we're still good-bying,
But as long as you love me so,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song
High above the tree
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace wall mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping? This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary! Why lies he in such mean estate,
Where ox and cattle are feeding?
Good christian fear for sinners here,
The silent world is pleading. This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary! So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come peasant king to own Him,
The King of kings, salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him. This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary! Raise, raise the song on high,
The Virgin sings her lullaby:
Joy, joy, for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary! God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from satans power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy From God our heavenly father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in bethlehem was born
The son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy Fear not said the angel
Let nothing you affright
This day is born a savior
Of the pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From satans power and might
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy And when they came to bethlehem
Where our dear savior lay
They found him in the manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother mary kneeled down
And to the lord did pray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Let your heart be light
From now on,
our troubles will be out of sight Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on,
our troubles will be miles away. Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are so dear to us
Gather near to us once more. Through the years
We all will be together,
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
And have yourself A merry little Christmas now. Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh i heard there was a secret chord
that David played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do you
well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall and the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah hallelujah... 4 x well your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah hallelujah...4 x baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
but love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah hallelujah...4 x well there was a time when you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show that to me do you
but remember when i moved in you
and the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah hallelujah 4 x well, maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah hallelujah...4 x I did my best it wasn't much couldn't feel so I tried touch I told the truth i did not come to fool you
and even though it all went wrong I stand before the lord of song with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah hallelujah 4 x They say I took the name in vain I don't even know the name but if I did well really what's it to you
and there's a blaze of light in every word doesn't matter
which you've the holy or the broken hallelujah hallelujah 4 x Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Well, I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet Ho ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year (Kim Carnes) O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in. O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel I first met her in December on a snowy winter's night
And it didn't take me long to see that something wasn't right
They called her Christmas Carol Said her mind was nearly gone
But she could still light up the room
When she sang a Christmas song Seems no one knows the story to explain her Christmas cheer
Why she keeps the decorations up all through the year And though she long ago forgot the names of family and friends
When it comes to singing Christmas songs
She's like a child again CHORUS:
Sing, oh sing, Christmas Carol
Sing with all of your might
Sing Joy to the World
Sing O Holy Night You're closer now to Jesus
Than you've ever been Sing, oh sing, Christmas Carol
Sing your songs to him I had told my son about her, so I thought I'd take him by
And he was so amazed at all the tinsel and the lights
She laughed and told her stories of her Christmas memories
But nothing told it better than when she began to sing CHORUS The last time that I saw her, she didn't recognize me
Her hair was thin and she was frail, and she couldn't even speak
But I could sit down next to her, sing her favorite Christmas songs
And somehow, God only knows how
She could still sing right along CHORUS No room in the inn
No beautiful chamber, no soft cradle bed,
No place but a manger, nowhere for His head;
No praises of gladness, no thought of their sin,
No glory but sadness, no room in the inn. Refrain No room, no room, for Jesus,
O give Him welcome free,
Lest you should hear at Heaven's gate,
"There is no room for thee." No sweet consecration, no seeking His part,
No humiliation, no place in the heart;
No thought of the Savior, no sorrow for sin,
No prayer for His favor, no room in the inn. Refrain No one to receive Him, no welcome while here,
No balm to relieve Him, no staff but a spear;
No seeking His treasure, no weeping for sin,
No doing His pleasure, no room in the inn. Refrain Happy birthday, Jesus, it's that time of year
All the lights on the trees say Christmas time is near
Another year's behind us, you helped us make it through
So, happy birthday, Jesus, this song is just for you We all get so hung up on material things at times it seems like we forget
What Christmas really means
It should be thanks we're givin', that's why I wrote this tune
Happy birthday, Jesus, this song is just for you There's a gift for everyone but you underneath the tree
No, it's not much, but I hope you like this song to you from me Happy birthday Jesus, that's why I wrote this tune
So, happy birthday, Jesus, my song is just for you (Patty Loveless) Christmas Time's A-Comin'
Christmas Time's A-Comin'

And I know I'm goin' home. (Mark Chesnutt) You are the light of the world!
You are the light of the world!
But if that light is under a bushel,
Brrr, it's lost something kind of crucial
You got to stay bright to be the light of the world You are the salt of the earth
You are the salt of the earth
But if that salt has lost its flavor
It ain't got much in its favor
You can't have that fault and be the salt of the earth! So let your light so shine before men
Let your light so shine
So that they might know some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine (let's have some wine!) You are the city of God
You are the city of God
But if that city's on a hill
It's kinda hard to hide it well
You've got to stay pretty in the city of God So let your light so shine before men
Let your light so shine
So that they might know some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine (let's have some wine!) You are the light of the world
You are the light of the world
But the tallest candlestick
Ain't much good without a wick
You've got to live right to be the light of the world Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog
And we'd begged her not to go
But she'd left her medication
So she stumbled out the door into the snow When they found her Christmas mornin'
At the scene of the attack
There were hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(On her way home)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(Say there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe) Now we're all so proud of Grandpa
He's been takin' this so well
See him in there watchin' football
Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?
(send them back) Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(Midnight before Christmas)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(Say, there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe) Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And a blue and silver candle
That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig I've warned all my friends and neighbors
"Better watch out for yourselves"
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(Minding her own business)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(What do you mean there's no Santa?)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe) Oh
As for me and Grandpa, we believe
(We believe in Santa Claus) (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)
(Trisha Yearwood) Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you (Alabama) There's a road that I remember leading to a special place
Where the door was always open to a smiling face
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy who looks like me
And it's always the same, there's a stocking with my name And a candle in the window, a flame against the night
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
Now it don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window
Oh at Christmas, in your heart, in your heart
Maybe it's just wishful thinking I can hear the sleigh bells ring
Almost taste the pie Momma's baking, it's Christmas Eve And there's a candle in the window, there's a flame against the night
The candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go
There's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
A simple candle in the window and Christmas in your heart
In your heart, in your heart
Just a candle in the window, just a candle in the window Talk:
Dear Santa Claus
I sure thank you for all the gifts
And after I thought it over Santa
I decided to write
And thank you for all the toys
And especially the bike
My little brother John
And my sister Sue
And mom and dad
Said to tell you thank you too
Oh yeah Santa theres something else I want to say
Please dont get mad at me 'cuz I gave my toys away
You know my friend Jerry
Who lives across the railroad track?
He doesnt even have a mom or dad
Just a little brother Jack
I went to see them
I went over there to see them today
And Santa I never seen such broken hearted boys til I
saw them that way
Jerry cried and he said he didnt understand
You musta didnt have enough toys to go around
You musta just run out of toys
On his side of town
I divided all my toys
Except for the bike
And I told him that you made a mistake
And you left them at my house last night
I told him you thought that they spent the night with me
And you left a note that their toys wereunder my
Christmas tree
Now Santa I know its wrong to tell a lie
But you know that theyre my best friends
And I just couldnt stand to see em cry
I asked my mom and asked my dad
And they said whatever I wanted to do
They said youd forgive me
And theyd pray for God to forgive me too
When you come back again Santa
When you come back next time
And you see that youre running short
Put my name on the bottom line
And I know that this is a big ole world Santa
And someone is always gonna be blue
I just want you to know I still love you
And Jerry and Jack love you too
I felt awfully bad when I started this letter
But since I finished I feel a whole lot better
A whole lot better
I love you Santa
Good night

Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine on O beautiful star the hope of life
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn
Into the land of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
O beautiful star of Bethlehem

Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine on O beautiful star the hope of grace
For the redeemed, the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter He will shine

Every Christmas Eve in a western town
Gather up the kids all the friends and family
'Cause the holly's hung and the candle's bright
Tuning up a fiddle on a moon lit night
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree.
There's a jolly man in a bright red suit
Did you ever see a Santa in cowboy boots
Twirling across the floor spurs a-jingling merri-ly
As they sing those carols soft and low
We'll all be shouting out cotton-eyed Joe
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree
Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow there's to much I could miss
"Cause a western girl can't be still
and a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree Red Bandanas, kelly green,
Silver buckles on a new blue jeans
Jumpin' 'round the room to a yule tide melo-dy
I'm gonna be ready when Santa's comes
But I'm gonna be dancing til he does
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow there's to much I could miss
"Cause a western girl can't be still
and a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree (Steve Wariner) It's the most wonderful time of the year.
With those kids jingle belling,
and everyone telling you,
"Be of good cheer,"
It's the most wonderful time of the year.
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all There'll be parties for hosting,
marshmallows for toasting and
caroling out in the snow. There'll
be scary ghost stories and
tales of the glories of Christmases
long, long ago. It's the most wonderful time of the year.
There'll be much mistletoeing
and hearts will be glowing,
when loved ones are near.
It's the most wonderful time of the year. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells
All the way, all the way (Amy Grant) We've got our little fingers workin' hard
On the trains and dolls and cars
Hurryin' 'cuz Santa's a-waitin'
Soldiers marchin' out the door
Carryin' the toys galore
For Santa's reindeer ride This is more than just another reindeer ride
Not a practice run in July
We've got to load up all the festive gear
Peace, and hope, and yuletide cheer
For Santa's reindeer ride Polish the runners, shine Rudolph's nose
Tighten the harness, brush off the snow
We'd love to sing our little working songs,
Wish that we could tag along
Just to see the children's faces
Tonight the world is filled with joy,
Deeper than the games and toys
It's time to load up the sleigh.
Tonight the world is filled with joy,
Deeper than the games and toys
It's time to load up the sleigh. (It's time to load up the sleigh).
For Santa's reindeer ride. (Alabama) It's that time of year when the whole world is heart to heart
You can feel love all around you, you can see it everywhere Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces
Christmas is love Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling
Chirstmas is love, hear the church bells ring
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving
Christmas is love We all gather 'round, watch the lights dancing on the tree
The spirit of the season, you feel it in the air Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling
Christmas is love, just hear the church bells ring
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving
Christmas is love, Christmas is love, Christmas is love (Kathy Mattea) We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star
Shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
Well I've heard
That a King might come
But up 'til now there hasn't been one There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem (Lee Ann Womack) Immensity cloistered in thy dear womb,
Now leaves His well-belov'd imprisonment,
There He hath made Himself to His intent
Weak enough, now into the world to come;
But O, for thee, for Him, hath the inn no room?
Yet lay Him in this stall, and from the Orient,
Stars and wise men will travel to prevent
The effect of Herod's jealous general doom.
Seest thou, my soul, with thy faith's eyes, how He
Which fills all place, yet none holds Him, doth lie?
Was not His pity towards thee wondrous high,
That would have need to be pitied by thee?
Kiss Him, and with Him into Egypt go,
With His kind mother, who partakes thy woe. On the Morning of Christ's Nativity
This is the month, and this the happy morn
Wherein the Son of Heav'n's eternal King,
Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born,
Our great redemption from above did bring;
For so the holy sages once did sing,
That he our deadly forfeit should release,
And with his Father work us a perpetual peace. II
That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,
And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,
Wherewith he wont at Heav'n's high council-table,
To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,
He laid aside, and here with us to be,
Forsook the courts of everlasting day,
And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay. III
Say Heav'nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein
Afford a present to the Infant God?
Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,
To welcome him to this his new abode,
Now while the heav'n, by the Sun's team untrod,
Hath took no print of the approaching light,
And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright? IV
See how from far upon the eastern road
The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet:
O run, prevent them with thy humble ode,
And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;
Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,
And join thy voice unto the angel quire,
From out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire Sing a Christmas song
Christmas children live in a Christmas daydream
Sing a Christmas song
Christmas children hunger for Christmas morning Christmas children peep into Christmas windows
See a world as pretty as a dream
Christmas trees and toys
Christmas hopes and joys
Christmas puddings rich with Christmas creams
Christmas presents shine in the Christmas windows
Christmas boxes tied with pretty bows Kids Sing:
Wondering what's inside, what delights they hide But till Christmas morning no one knows
Little Boy Sings: Won't it be exciting if it snows I suppose that children everywhere (everywhere)
Will say a Christmas prayer
Till Santa brings their Christmas things Christmas children live in a Christmas daydream
Waiting for the magic to unfold
Children Sing: Wonderous things to eat, every Christmas treat/ Which are not a part of Christmas gold
Here it ties us childdren young and old
I suppose that children everywhere
Will say a Christmas prayer
Till Santa brings their Christmas things Christmas children hunger for Christmas morning
Christmas days are wonders to behold (to behold)
Children Sing: Young ones dreams come true Not some young ones to
We believe that story we've been told
Christmas is for children young and old Christmas Children
Sing a Christmas carol
Sing a Christmas carol
Christmas children live in a Christmas daydream
Sing a Christmas carol
Sing a Christmas carol (Brooks & Dunn) Ill have a blue Christmas without you
Ill be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Wont be the same dear, if youre not here with me And when those blue snowflakes start falling
Thats when those blue memories start calling
Youll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But Ill have a blue Christmas Youll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But Ill have a blue, blue Christmas Smilin' faces on city streets, crowded shoppers, busy feet
And every smile just seems to say, we're having some Happy Holidays Twinklin' lights on Christmas trees, kids up on Santa's knew
Busy lines on telephones, sending a Merry Christmas home Bells ringing everywhere, season spirit in the air
Up and down the avenue, holiday dreams comin' true A choir singing songs of cheer, carols we all love to hear
Rudolph with his glowin' nose, lovers under mistletoe Postman bringin' Christmas cards, reindeer out in the yard
Frosty with his eyes of coal, present wrapped in pretty bows
Sidewalks full of happy eyes, flakes fallin' from the sky
Boys e St. Nick up on his sleigh The scene is set, it's beautiful, sounds of Peace, Joy and Love
From all of us we'd like to say, have yourself some Happy Holidays (Paul Brandt) Christmas time again
The perfect end, to a not-so-perfect year
At last it's here
Hustle bustle to and fro
From store to store, to get one more
Of whatever is in style this year On the marquis sign at 5 and 9
The latest movie shows, and it starts to snow
Children look into the sky
To see if reindeer really fly
Who knows
But when it comes down to this season
Above it all there's still a reason
To just look up A star is born tonight
Come to make things right Angels singing, anthems ringing
Glory to the King
A star is born tonite Silent holy night, heaven's sacred light
Shines all around
And joy resounds
In manger hay the baby Jesus came to seek
And save the lost
Until they're found
Peace on earth a new beginning
He's the gift that keeps on giving
To all of us A star is born tonight
Come to make things right Angels singing, anthems ringing
Glory to the King
A star is born tonite
Glory hallelujah, glory to the King of Kings
Merry Christmas to you all the joy the season brings Angels singing, anthems ringing
Glory to the King
A star is born tonight We Three Kings
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar.
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Born a king on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Frankincense to offer have I.
Incense owns a Deity nigh.
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Myrrh is mine: Its bitter perfume
Breaths a life of gathering gloom.
Sorrow, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in a stone-cold tomb. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice.
Alleluia, alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Following yonder star. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading,still proceeding,
Following yonder star! The new star is shining on the midnight sky
Stars will shine bright to the moonlight
The new star has shown shining spirit
Oh new star please shine your light
You make the night right
Oh please shine bright Today I climbed the hillside with the snowcapped evergreens
Stared down in the valley at a Christmas memory
Saw a young boy in a cabin hang a stockin' on a peg
Peace on Earth was ours down in the valley Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire ablazin', all the family's gathered 'round
There was nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground Mama still still plays carols on those worn out ivory keys
And Papa's hooked his old team up to fetch the Christmas tree
I watch my boy climb on a limb, shakin' loose the mistletoe
Just the way I did not so long ago Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire ablazin', all the family's gathered 'round
Well, there's nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire ablazin', all the family's gathered 'round
Well, There's nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground (George Strait) Chorus 1:
I sure do like those Christmas cookies sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees and bells and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe Verse 1:
Now Christmas cookies are a special treat
The more she bakes the more I eat
And sometimes I can't get myself to stop
Sometimes she'll wait til I'm asleep
And she'll take the ones that I didn't eat
And put those little sprinkley things on top (Repeat Chorus 1) Verse 2:
Now those sprinkley things just make things worse
Cause it makes em taste better than they did at first
And they're absolutely impossible to resist
Some disappear to who knows where
But I make sure I get my share
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss Chorus 2:
I sure do like those Christmas cookies sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe
She gets mad if they're all gone
Before she gets the icing put on
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe Verse 3:
Now there's a benefit to all of this
That you might have overlooked or missed
So now let me tell you the best part of it all
Every time she sticks another batch in the oven
There's fifteen minutes for some kissin' and huggin'
That's why I eat Christmas cookies all year long (Gary Allan) Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again Crowds will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas,
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
For this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
It's the time of year to be with the one you love So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, I'll be happy, once again There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy Christmas, once again Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Well, I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet Ho ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year (Joe Diffie) Up and down the street tonight
There's a Santa Claus at every light
Trees for sale on the corner lot
Waiting for a home Everywhere across the land
Gifts are wrapped with loving hands
Around the world as children sleep
A star begins to glow And somewhere, someone quietly explains
To a loved one what all this means Two thousands years ago
The sky was bright with the Heavenly host
Peace on Earth good will towards men
Has been hangin' in ever since
From that night and forevermore
Every man whether rich or poor
Will share the love, the hope, and joy
All because of a baby boy When Christmas Day is finally here
And friends and family gather near
Memories shared from seasons past
And a little child will ask The someone, somewhere will quietly explain
To a loved one what all this means Two thousands years ago
The sky was bright with the Heavenly host
Peace on Earth good will towards men
Has been hangin' in ever since
From that night and forevermore
Every man whether rich or poor
Will share the love, the hope, and joy
All because of a baby boy Gather round and I will tell
The story of the Christmas bell
Who use to shine and shine and ring
And why they called him Ding a ling One of the famous jingle bells
Is what he was but then he fell
And broke his pretty harmony
And he began to ring off key Now they call him Ding a ling
Because he has a funny ring
And doesnt hit his note too well
Ding a ling the Christmas bell The other bells met secretly
And he heard one say in a real low key
He's sure to ruin our Christmas sound
And we dont want him hanging around He overheard their secret vote
And walked away with a lump in his note
The saddest bell youve ever seen
The Christmas bell called Ding a ling They all call him Ding a ling
Because he has a funny ring
And doesnt hit his note too well
Ding a ling the Christmas bell The snow was falling in the square
When the children found him there
And placed him on the Christmas tree
For everyone in town to see As Christmas Eve came to the town
A blinding snow was coming down
And Ding a ling heard someone say
Old Santas sure to lose his way The thought occurred to ding a ling
To ring as loud as He could ring
And when old Santa heard the sound
It guided him into the town Now the children shout and sing
And everyone loves Ding a ling
So everything has turned out well
For Ding a ling the Christmas bell (Vince Gill) There's an angel in us all
A little voice inside that answers every call
There's a joyous sound resounding in your heart
A ray of hope that shines as bright as any star Remember... For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings
So show you care and share your light
And help an angel fly tonight An act of kindness, a tender smile
These little blessings seem to make it all worth while
So try and do what's ringing true inside your heart Remember... For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings
So show you care and share your light
And help an angel fly tonight (Another angel) Everybody sing
(Another angel) It's a wonderful life
For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings Say you believe in what you are
Share the love that's ringing true inside your heart Remember... For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings
So show you care and share your light
And help an angel fly tonight (Another angel) Everybody sing
(Another angel) It's a wonderful life
For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings (Another angel) Everybody sing
(Another angel) It's a wonderful life (Another angel)
(Another angel) It's a wonderful life (Another angel)
(Another angel) (Reba McEntire) At an antique desk
An old man sits alone
It's Christmas Eve
And it's almost time to go He signs his name to a letter he just wrote
Then he reads it back with a voice as soft as snow I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child
A world where hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love Then he walks outside
And he climbs up on his sleigh
And calls out to his reindeer
Off they fly away
Oh tonight he'll make a million dreams appear
While he wishes that his own dreams would come true this year I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child
A world where hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love A world where hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE BIT OLD FASHIONED
AND IT MAY NOT BE THE TREND OF THE YEAR.
BUT LET'S TAKE THE STORE BOUGHT FEELING OUT OF CHRISTMAS
AND HAVE THE KIND THAT MAMA HELD SO DEAR. LET'S NOT HAVE A SINGLE PIE IF WE CAN'T MAKE IT
AND I'LL SHARPEN UP THE AX TO CUT OUR TREE.
LET THE LITTLE ONES MAKE ALL THE DECORATIONS
AND GET BACK TO THE WAY IT USED TO BE. LET'S HAVE CHRISTMAS LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE IT
BACK BEFORE WE ALL HAD IT MADE.
LET'S SPEND TIME SPENDING LOVE INSTEAD OF MONEY
TAKE A SLEIGH RIDE BACK INTO THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
FOR IT'S THERE THAT LIES THE STRENGTH OF OUR FAMILY
THE GOOD LORD INTENDED IT THIS WAY.
SO THIS YEAR LET'S DO OUR BEST NOT TO FAKE IT
LETS HAVE CHRISTMAS LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE IT.
LET'S CALL UNCLE ED TO TUNE THAT OLD PIANO
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG SINCE WE'VE ALL SANG SILENT NIGHT.
LET THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE IT THEIR WAY
BUT THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA DO IT RIGHT.
LET'S HAVE CHRISTMAS LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE IT
BACK BEFORE WE ALL HAD IT MADE.
LET'S SPEND TIME SPENDING LOVE INSTEAD OF MONEY
TAKE A SLEIGH RIDE BACK INTO THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
FOR IT'S THERE THAT LIES THE STRENGTH OF OUR FAMILY
THE GOOD LORD INTENDED IT THIS WAY.
SO THIS YEAR LET'S DO OUR BEST NOT TO FAKE IT
LET'S HAVE CHRISTMAS LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE IT. (Toby Keith) My billfold doesn't have a prayer
There's Christmas catalogs everywhere
She keeps looking at the jewelry section
Cutting pictures out of her selections I said we need to hold it down this year
And in her eye she got a big ol' tear
She wants a Christmas rock
But Santas pockets ain't got no roll She don't want pots and pans
Just something shinin' on her hand
With an emerald or a diamond on it
I had a budget but she's gone and blown it
Down to the jewelry store, here I go
Hear the clerk say, ho, ho, ho
She wants a Christmas rock
But Santas pockets ain't got no roll She don't want anything from sears
No tools or garden shears
There's something special on her mind
And I can't even afford the shine I wish she'd settled for a long nightshirt
No, Ive got to give till it hurts
She wants a Christmas rock
But Santas pockets ain't got no roll She don't want pots and pans
Just something shinin' on her hand
With an emerald or a diamond on it
I had a budget but she's gone and blown it
Down to the jewelry store, here I go
Hear the clerk say, ho, ho, ho
She wants a Christmas rock
But Santas pockets ain't got no roll She wants a Christmas rock
But ol' Santas pockets ain't got no roll (Clint Black) (Chorus:)
Youre as slow as christmas, I was up before the dawn
Up so fast I missed it or was that old saying wrong
Every christmas day makes every other day seem long
And what seemed would never get here
Has so quickly come and gone Ive heard old sayings, old cliches and
Most of them make sense
But were wiser in our younger days not easily convinced
Theres no way to look ahead with the wool over your eyes
And it seems that santas sled isnt the only thing that flies (Chorus) Were bringing in another year lets throw the old one back
With my new train Ill be the engineer
And hurry down the track
While I know that time is standing still
I hear that old cliche
And Im more convinced it does until that
One december day (Chorus 2x) When Im as slow as christmas
Ill be up before the dawn
Im gonna miss this
I know that old sayings wrong
Every christmas day makes other day seem long
And what seemed would never get here
Has so quickly come and gone,
Come and gone (Alabama) Snowy days and frosty night, everything looks cold and white
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, hangin' 'round the mistletoe Christmas day will soon be here, and everybody's full of cheer
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear Well, I've waited all year long and nore the year is almost gone
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, hangin' 'round the mistletoe But if that's what I've gotta do just to get a kiss from you
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear Christmas is a special time to give and to receive
For every little kiss you give me I will give you three You ain't gonna miss one kiss, that's one thing you'll never miss
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletow waitin' for you dear Well, I've had my eyes on you for a long, long time
So, I'm asking Santa please, make that pretty girl mine Waited till I'm cold and blue just to get a kiss from you
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear Early one Christmas morning..
ever so long ago..
The brightness of stars in heaven..
shown down on the earth below.. Shepherd's and wise men together..
offered their treasures its told..
and yet there was one so humble..
who gave neither silver nor gold.. I am just a lonely shepherd boy..
no earthly riches have I..
but the love and devotion I give thee..
will last till the waters run dry.. Though treasures of shepherd's and wise men..
ashes to ashes have gone..
the gift of a poor humble shepherd boy..
in the spirit of Christmas lives on.... The love and devotion of a poor shepard boy..
in the spirit of Christmas lives on.... I (Joe Diffie) Turn out the lights
We just need the lights from the tree
The kids are in bed
Baby it's just you and me
Side by side, the fire is bright, on this oh so blessed night The gifts lying there
Cannot compare to the love you give
Sealed with a kiss
For as long as I live
Ribbons and bows, could never show, all that I want you know I want to take you in my arms tonight
And keep the fire burning bright
'Cause if the best things in life are free
There's nothing you could buy for me
Your presence is enough
Wrap me in your love Look into the night
There's a star in the sky that I see
It's come so far
To shine its light for you and me
As if it know, I'm holding you close, underneath the mistletoe I want to take you in my arms tonight
And keep the fire burning bright
'Cause if the best things in life are free
There's nothing you could buy for me
Your presence is enough
Wrap me in your love Your presence is enough
Wrap me in your love (Steve Wariner) Ol' December's here at last
Time for celebration
Christmas present
Christmas past
Tumble down together like the snow
What a show
Now the snowman Karen made
Is melting by the roadside
On the wind a serenade
Of children's voices singing I believe
I believe in love
I believ On Christmas morning
You awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms
We watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me and I realize how sweet a life can be
All the memories
Coming back again this year Sentimental melodies
surround me like an old friend
Spent a winter here with me
Silently we watched the seasons change
And they change so fast
Fade away On Christmas morning
You awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms
We watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me
And I realize how sweet a life can be
All the memories will always take me back, hold me back in time On Christmas morning
You awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms
We watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me
And I realize how sweet a life can be
Ooh the memories will always take me back in time
To Christmas morning
On Christmas morning The girl at the grocery she's pretty and seems nice
But she looks right through me with eyes cold as ice
She never answers when I ask her name
She only says I should have a great day But hey what could she mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool she takes me for
Not anything more I guess it's the season the time of the year
When people they're happy and full of good cheer
Well they'll wish you and kiss you and wish you again
And they'll tell you it's peace and good will to all men But hey what could they mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool they take me for
Not anything more We stood at the altar and you held my hand
And everyone watched as the preacher he asked
Will you take him and love him for bad and for good
You looked at me then you told him you would But hey what did you mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool you take me for
Not anything more Now each Christmas morning I sit in my chair
And I look up at the angels that float through the air
Some look down upon me, some come to my side
And they tell me that Jesus he said to say hi (Dwight Yoakam) Come on Christmas
Please take me away
Keep me hidden safe
'Til January's second day
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel I'll wrap myself
Up in the cheer
That's so abundant
This time of year
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel Even though it's just September
I can forget to remember
All the empty nights
Still in my way Come on Christmas
Embrace me with some joy
'Til the last few lonely moments
Of this year have been destroyed
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel I'll just let visions of the season
Blind these worn-out sights
Still in my mind
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel
Come on Christmas (Dolly Parton) You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave
Christmas to remember, too good to believe
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind And you've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember We loved and laughed and played and joked
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes
Then to the lodge for dinner
But now it's time for us to go
As our hearts melt like chimney snow
There's just one thing I want to know
Can we do this next winter
Oh! What a Christmas to remember You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
