And let it begin with me.
Let there be peace on earth
The peace that was meant to be.
With God as our Father
Brothers all are we.

And live each moment
With peace eternally.

Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me. I really can't stay (Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go way (Baby, it's cold outside)
The evening has been (I've been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hand, they're just like ice) My mother will start to worry (Hey beautiful, what's your hurry)
And father will be pacing the floor (Listen to that fireplace roar)
So really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
Well, maybe just a half a drink more (Put some music on while I pour) The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink (No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell) I oughtta say no, no, no sir (You mind if I move in closer)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (And what's the sense in hurting my pride)
I really cant stay (Oh baby, don't hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside I simply must go (It's cold outside)
The answer is no (Baby, it's cold outside)
The welcome has been (So lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm) My sister will be suspicious (Your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Like waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh your lips are delicious)
Well maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before) I've got to get home (Baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
Oh, but don't you see (How can you do this thing to me) There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Making my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia)
I really cant stay (Get over that old out)
Oh, but baby its cold outside Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born Down in a lowly manger
Our humble Christ was born
And God send us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born Bridge: There's something ' bout Christmas time
Something ' bout Christmas time
We're gonna talk about the manger
and sing about the Savior
Knowing that it's Christmas time. (X2) Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born Mary, did you know
that your Baby Boy would one day walk on water? Mary, did you know
that your Baby Boy would save our sons and daughters? Did you know

This Child that you delivered will soon deliver you. Mary, did you know
that your Baby Boy will give sight to a blind man? Mary, did you know
that your baby boy will calm the storm with His hand? Did you know
that your Baby Boy has walked where angels trod?
When you kiss your little Baby you kiss the face of God? Mary did you know.. Mary did you know The blind will see.
The deaf will hear.
The dead will live again.
The lame will leap.
The dumb will speak
The praises of The Lamb. Mary did you know Mary, did you know
that your Baby Boy is Lord of all creation? Mary, did you know
that your Baby Boy would one day rule the nations? Did you know
that your Baby Boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
The sleeping Child you're holding is the Great, I Am. Mary did you know Dashing through the snow

Up on the housetop, click, click, click
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made of coal Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made out of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, Let's run and have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying Catch me if you can He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler stop Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', Please don't cry
I'll be back again some day Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o're the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo Shepherds why this Jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo Come to Bethlehem to see
him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo See him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo Silent night, Holy night, All is calm, All is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace. Silent night, Holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia;
Christ the Savior, is born!
Christ the Savior, is born! Silent night, Holy night,
Son of God, Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth. O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder brings a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error-pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder brings a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine (Rebecca Lynn Howard) The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down. When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland. (Tom T. Hall) O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy leaves are so unchanging;
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy leaves are so unchanging;
Not only green when summer's here,
But also when 'tis cold and drear.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy leaves are so unchanging! O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Much pleasure thou can'st give me;
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Much pleasure thou can'st give me;
How often has the Christmas tree
Afforded me the greatest glee!
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Much pleasure thou can'st give me. O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!

From base to summit, gay and bright,
There's only splendor for the sight.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
Thy candles shine so brightly! O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
How richly God has decked thee!
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
How richly God has decked thee!
Thou bidst us true and faithful be,
And trust in God unchangingly.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!
How richly God has decked thee! !" Away in a manger,
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay. The cattle are lowing
The Baby awakes
The little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
til morning is nigh. Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray.
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us for heaven
To live with Thee there. Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;
We too will thither bend our joyful footsteps; O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord. Child, for us sinners poor and in the manger,
We would embrace Thee, with love and awe;
Who would not love Thee, loving us so dearly? O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning;
Jesus, to Thee be glory given;
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing. O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord. (Brenda Lee) Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly" Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly" Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way (Chely Wright) Oh the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I've bought some corn for popping,
The lights are turned way down low,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! When we finally kiss goodnight,
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm. The fire is slowly dying,
And, my dear, we're still good-bying,
But as long as you love me so,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song
High above the tree
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace wall mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping? This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary! Why lies he in such mean estate,
Where ox and cattle are feeding?
Good christian fear for sinners here,
The silent world is pleading. This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary! So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come peasant king to own Him,
The King of kings, salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him. This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary! Raise, raise the song on high,
The Virgin sings her lullaby:
Joy, joy, for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary! God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from satans power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy From God our heavenly father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in bethlehem was born
The son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy Fear not said the angel
Let nothing you affright
This day is born a savior
Of the pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From satans power and might
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy And when they came to bethlehem
Where our dear savior lay
They found him in the manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother mary kneeled down
And to the lord did pray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Let your heart be light
From now on,
our troubles will be out of sight Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on,
our troubles will be miles away. Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are so dear to us
Gather near to us once more. Through the years
We all will be together,
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
And have yourself A merry little Christmas now. Here we are as in olden days,

A Merry Little Christmas Now. (The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style

Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear Silver bells
Silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling
Hear them ring

With those holiday greetings
And great happy meetings
When friends come to call

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh i heard there was a secret chord
that David played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do you
well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall and the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah hallelujah... 4 x well your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah hallelujah...4 x baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
but love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah hallelujah...4 x well there was a time when you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show that to me do you
but remember when i moved in you
and the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah hallelujah 4 x well, maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah hallelujah...4 x I did my best it wasn't much couldn't feel so I tried touch I told the truth i did not come to fool you
and even though it all went wrong I stand before the lord of song with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah hallelujah 4 x They say I took the name in vain I don't even know the name but if I did well really what's it to you
and there's a blaze of light in every word doesn't matter
which you've the holy or the broken hallelujah hallelujah 4 x Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Well, I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet Ho ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year (Kim Carnes) O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in. O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel I first met her in December on a snowy winter's night
And it didn't take me long to see that something wasn't right
They called her Christmas Carol Said her mind was nearly gone
But she could still light up the room
When she sang a Christmas song Seems no one knows the story to explain her Christmas cheer
Why she keeps the decorations up all through the year And though she long ago forgot the names of family and friends
When it comes to singing Christmas songs
She's like a child again CHORUS:
Sing, oh sing, Christmas Carol
Sing with all of your might
Sing Joy to the World
Sing O Holy Night You're closer now to Jesus
Than you've ever been Sing, oh sing, Christmas Carol
Sing your songs to him I had told my son about her, so I thought I'd take him by
And he was so amazed at all the tinsel and the lights
She laughed and told her stories of her Christmas memories
But nothing told it better than when she began to sing CHORUS The last time that I saw her, she didn't recognize me
Her hair was thin and she was frail, and she couldn't even speak
But I could sit down next to her, sing her favorite Christmas songs
And somehow, God only knows how
She could still sing right along CHORUS No room in the inn
No beautiful chamber, no soft cradle bed,
No place but a manger, nowhere for His head;
No praises of gladness, no thought of their sin,
No glory but sadness, no room in the inn. Refrain No room, no room, for Jesus,
O give Him welcome free,
Lest you should hear at Heaven's gate,
"There is no room for thee." No sweet consecration, no seeking His part,
No humiliation, no place in the heart;
No thought of the Savior, no sorrow for sin,
No prayer for His favor, no room in the inn. Refrain No one to receive Him, no welcome while here,
No balm to relieve Him, no staff but a spear;
No seeking His treasure, no weeping for sin,
No doing His pleasure, no room in the inn. Refrain Happy birthday, Jesus, it's that time of year
All the lights on the trees say Christmas time is near
Another year's behind us, you helped us make it through
So, happy birthday, Jesus, this song is just for you We all get so hung up on material things at times it seems like we forget
What Christmas really means
It should be thanks we're givin', that's why I wrote this tune
Happy birthday, Jesus, this song is just for you There's a gift for everyone but you underneath the tree
No, it's not much, but I hope you like this song to you from me Happy birthday Jesus, that's why I wrote this tune
So, happy birthday, Jesus, my song is just for you (Patty Loveless) Christmas Time's A-Comin'

And I know I'm goin' home. (Mark Chesnutt) You are the light of the world!
You are the light of the world!
But if that light is under a bushel,
Brrr, it's lost something kind of crucial
You got to stay bright to be the light of the world You are the salt of the earth
You are the salt of the earth
But if that salt has lost its flavor
It ain't got much in its favor
You can't have that fault and be the salt of the earth! So let your light so shine before men
Let your light so shine
So that they might know some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine (let's have some wine!) You are the city of God
You are the city of God
But if that city's on a hill
It's kinda hard to hide it well
You've got to stay pretty in the city of God So let your light so shine before men
Let your light so shine
So that they might know some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine (let's have some wine!) You are the light of the world
You are the light of the world
But the tallest candlestick
Ain't much good without a wick
You've got to live right to be the light of the world Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog
And we'd begged her not to go
But she'd left her medication
So she stumbled out the door into the snow When they found her Christmas mornin'
At the scene of the attack
There were hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(On her way home)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(Say there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe) Now we're all so proud of Grandpa
He's been takin' this so well
See him in there watchin' football
Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?
(send them back) Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(Midnight before Christmas)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(Say, there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe) Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And a blue and silver candle
That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig I've warned all my friends and neighbors
"Better watch out for yourselves"
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(Minding her own business)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(What do you mean there's no Santa?)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe) Oh
As for me and Grandpa, we believe
(We believe in Santa Claus) (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)
(Trisha Yearwood) Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you (Alabama) There's a road that I remember leading to a special place
Where the door was always open to a smiling face
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy who looks like me
And it's always the same, there's a stocking with my name And a candle in the window, a flame against the night
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
Now it don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window
Oh at Christmas, in your heart, in your heart
Maybe it's just wishful thinking I can hear the sleigh bells ring
Almost taste the pie Momma's baking, it's Christmas Eve And there's a candle in the window, there's a flame against the night
The candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go
There's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
A simple candle in the window and Christmas in your heart
In your heart, in your heart
Just a candle in the window, just a candle in the window Talk:
Dear Santa Claus
I sure thank you for all the gifts
And after I thought it over Santa
I decided to write
And thank you for all the toys
And especially the bike
My little brother John
And my sister Sue
And mom and dad
Said to tell you thank you too
Oh yeah Santa theres something else I want to say
Please dont get mad at me 'cuz I gave my toys away
You know my friend Jerry
Who lives across the railroad track?
He doesnt even have a mom or dad
Just a little brother Jack
I went to see them
I went over there to see them today
And Santa I never seen such broken hearted boys til I
saw them that way
Jerry cried and he said he didnt understand
You musta didnt have enough toys to go around
You musta just run out of toys
On his side of town
I divided all my toys
Except for the bike
And I told him that you made a mistake
And you left them at my house last night
I told him you thought that they spent the night with me
And you left a note that their toys wereunder my
Christmas tree
Now Santa I know its wrong to tell a lie
But you know that theyre my best friends
And I just couldnt stand to see em cry
I asked my mom and asked my dad
And they said whatever I wanted to do
They said youd forgive me
And theyd pray for God to forgive me too
When you come back again Santa
When you come back next time
And you see that youre running short
Put my name on the bottom line
And I know that this is a big ole world Santa
And someone is always gonna be blue
I just want you to know I still love you
And Jerry and Jack love you too
I felt awfully bad when I started this letter
But since I finished I feel a whole lot better
A whole lot better
I love you Santa
Good night

Jingle bells chime and jingle bells time
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in a jingling beat
That's the jingle bell, that's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock O the shining light from the waves of sand in the blue skys above the earth where you baby jesus lay in your crib and lead us to the star which leads us to you who is the savior sent from your father god and created by your mother mary
Shining far through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine on O beautiful star the hope of life
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn
Into the land of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine on O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
O beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shine on O beautiful star the hope of grace
For the redeemed, the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter He will shine

Every Christmas Eve in a western town
Gather up the kids all the friends and family
'Cause the holly's hung and the candle's bright
Tuning up a fiddle on a moon lit night
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree.
There's a jolly man in a bright red suit
Did you ever see a Santa in cowboy boots
Twirling across the floor spurs a-jingling merri-ly
As they sing those carols soft and low
We'll all be shouting out cotton-eyed Joe
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree
Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow there's to much I could miss
"Cause a western girl can't be still
and a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree Red Bandanas, kelly green,
Silver buckles on a new blue jeans
Jumpin' 'round the room to a yule tide melo-dy
I'm gonna be ready when Santa's comes
But I'm gonna be dancing til he does
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow there's to much I could miss
"Cause a western girl can't be still
and a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree (Steve Wariner) It's the most wonderful time of the year.
With those kids jingle belling,
and everyone telling you,
"Be of good cheer,"
It's the most wonderful time of the year.
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all There'll be parties for hosting,
marshmallows for toasting and
caroling out in the snow. There'll
be scary ghost stories and
tales of the glories of Christmases
long, long ago. It's the most wonderful time of the year.
There'll be much mistletoeing
and hearts will be glowing,
when loved ones are near.
It's the most wonderful time of the year. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells
All the way, all the way (Amy Grant) We've got our little fingers workin' hard
On the trains and dolls and cars
Hurryin' 'cuz Santa's a-waitin'
Soldiers marchin' out the door
Carryin' the toys galore
For Santa's reindeer ride This is more than just another reindeer ride
Not a practice run in July
We've got to load up all the festive gear
Peace, and hope, and yuletide cheer
For Santa's reindeer ride Polish the runners, shine Rudolph's nose
Tighten the harness, brush off the snow
We'd love to sing our little working songs,
Wish that we could tag along
Just to see the children's faces
Tonight the world is filled with joy,
Deeper than the games and toys
It's time to load up the sleigh.
Tonight the world is filled with joy,
Deeper than the games and toys
It's time to load up the sleigh. (It's time to load up the sleigh).
For Santa's reindeer ride. (Alabama) It's that time of year when the whole world is heart to heart
You can feel love all around you, you can see it everywhere Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces
Christmas is love Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling
Chirstmas is love, hear the church bells ring
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving
Christmas is love We all gather 'round, watch the lights dancing on the tree
The spirit of the season, you feel it in the air Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling
Christmas is love, just hear the church bells ring
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving
Christmas is love, Christmas is love, Christmas is love (Kathy Mattea) We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star
Shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
Well I've heard
That a King might come
But up 'til now there hasn't been one There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem (Lee Ann Womack) Immensity cloistered in thy dear womb,
Now leaves His well-belov'd imprisonment,
There He hath made Himself to His intent
Weak enough, now into the world to come;
But O, for thee, for Him, hath the inn no room?
Yet lay Him in this stall, and from the Orient,
Stars and wise men will travel to prevent
The effect of Herod's jealous general doom.
Seest thou, my soul, with thy faith's eyes, how He
Which fills all place, yet none holds Him, doth lie?
Was not His pity towards thee wondrous high,
That would have need to be pitied by thee?
Kiss Him, and with Him into Egypt go,
With His kind mother, who partakes thy woe. On the Morning of Christ's Nativity
This is the month, and this the happy morn
Wherein the Son of Heav'n's eternal King,
Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born,
Our great redemption from above did bring;
For so the holy sages once did sing,
That he our deadly forfeit should release,
And with his Father work us a perpetual peace. II
That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,
And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,
Wherewith he wont at Heav'n's high council-table,
To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,
He laid aside, and here with us to be,
Forsook the courts of everlasting day,
And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay. III
Say Heav'nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein
Afford a present to the Infant God?
Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,
To welcome him to this his new abode,
Now while the heav'n, by the Sun's team untrod,
Hath took no print of the approaching light,
And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright? IV
See how from far upon the eastern road
The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet:
O run, prevent them with thy humble ode,
And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;
Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,
And join thy voice unto the angel quire,
From out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire Sing a Christmas song
Christmas children live in a Christmas daydream

Thats when those blue memories start calling
Youll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But Ill have a blue Christmas Youll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But Ill have a blue, blue Christmas Smilin' faces on city streets, crowded shoppers, busy feet
And every smile just seems to say, we're having some Happy Holidays Twinklin' lights on Christmas trees, kids up on Santa's knew
Busy lines on telephones, sending a Merry Christmas home Bells ringing everywhere, season spirit in the air
Up and down the avenue, holiday dreams comin' true A choir singing songs of cheer, carols we all love to hear
Rudolph with his glowin' nose, lovers under mistletoe Postman bringin' Christmas cards, reindeer out in the yard
Frosty with his eyes of coal, present wrapped in pretty bows
Sidewalks full of happy eyes, flakes fallin' from the sky
Boys e St. Nick up on his sleigh The scene is set, it's beautiful, sounds of Peace, Joy and Love
From all of us we'd like to say, have yourself some Happy Holidays (Paul Brandt) Christmas time again
The perfect end, to a not-so-perfect year
At last it's here
Hustle bustle to and fro
From store to store, to get one more
Of whatever is in style this year On the marquis sign at 5 and 9
The latest movie shows, and it starts to snow
Children look into the sky
To see if reindeer really fly
Who knows
But when it comes down to this season
Above it all there's still a reason
To just look up A star is born tonight
Come to make things right Angels singing, anthems ringing
Glory to the King
A star is born tonite Silent holy night, heaven's sacred light
Shines all around
And joy resounds
In manger hay the baby Jesus came to seek
And save the lost
Until they're found
Peace on earth a new beginning
He's the gift that keeps on giving
To all of us A star is born tonight
Come to make things right Angels singing, anthems ringing
Glory to the King
A star is born tonite
Glory hallelujah, glory to the King of Kings
Merry Christmas to you all the joy the season brings Angels singing, anthems ringing
Glory to the King
A star is born tonight We Three Kings
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar.
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Born a king on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Frankincense to offer have I.
Incense owns a Deity nigh.
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light. Myrrh is mine: Its bitter perfume
Breaths a life of gathering gloom.
Sorrow, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in a stone-cold tomb. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice.
Alleluia, alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Following yonder star. O star of wonder, star of night,
Star of royal beauty bright,
Westward leading,still proceeding,
Following yonder star! The new star is shining on the midnight sky
Stars will shine bright to the moonlight
The new star has shown shining spirit
Oh new star please shine your light
You make the night right
Oh please shine bright Today I climbed the hillside with the snowcapped evergreens
Stared down in the valley at a Christmas memory
Saw a young boy in a cabin hang a stockin' on a peg
Peace on Earth was ours down in the valley Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire ablazin', all the family's gathered 'round
There was nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground Mama still still plays carols on those worn out ivory keys
And Papa's hooked his old team up to fetch the Christmas tree
I watch my boy climb on a limb, shakin' loose the mistletoe
Just the way I did not so long ago Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire ablazin', all the family's gathered 'round
Well, there's nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire ablazin', all the family's gathered 'round
Well, There's nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground (George Strait) Chorus 1:
I sure do like those Christmas cookies sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe
The ones that look like Santa Claus
Christmas trees and bells and stars
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe Verse 1:
Now Christmas cookies are a special treat
The more she bakes the more I eat
And sometimes I can't get myself to stop
Sometimes she'll wait til I'm asleep
And she'll take the ones that I didn't eat
And put those little sprinkley things on top (Repeat Chorus 1) Verse 2:
Now those sprinkley things just make things worse
Cause it makes em taste better than they did at first
And they're absolutely impossible to resist
Some disappear to who knows where
But I make sure I get my share
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss Chorus 2:
I sure do like those Christmas cookies sugar
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe
She gets mad if they're all gone
Before she gets the icing put on
I sure do like those Christmas cookies babe Verse 3:
Now there's a benefit to all of this
That you might have overlooked or missed
So now let me tell you the best part of it all
Every time she sticks another batch in the oven
There's fifteen minutes for some kissin' and huggin'
That's why I eat Christmas cookies all year long (Gary Allan) Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again Crowds will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas,
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
For this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
It's the time of year to be with the one you love So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, I'll be happy, once again There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy Christmas, once again Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Well, I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet Ho ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year (Joe Diffie) Up and down the street tonight
There's a Santa Claus at every light
Trees for sale on the corner lot
Waiting for a home Everywhere across the land
Gifts are wrapped with loving hands
Around the world as children sleep
A star begins to glow And somewhere, someone quietly explains
To a loved one what all this means Two thousands years ago
The sky was bright with the Heavenly host
Peace on Earth good will towards men
Has been hangin' in ever since
From that night and forevermore
Every man whether rich or poor
Will share the love, the hope, and joy
All because of a baby boy When Christmas Day is finally here
And friends and family gather near
Memories shared from seasons past
And a little child will ask The someone, somewhere will quietly explain
To a loved one what all this means Two thousands years ago
The sky was bright with the Heavenly host
Peace on Earth good will towards men
Has been hangin' in ever since
From that night and forevermore
Every man whether rich or poor
Will share the love, the hope, and joy
All because of a baby boy Gather round and I will tell
The story of the Christmas bell
Who use to shine and shine and ring
And why they called him Ding a ling One of the famous jingle bells
Is what he was but then he fell
And broke his pretty harmony
And he began to ring off key Now they call him Ding a ling
Because he has a funny ring
And doesnt hit his note too well
Ding a ling the Christmas bell The other bells met secretly
And he heard one say in a real low key
He's sure to ruin our Christmas sound
And we dont want him hanging around He overheard their secret vote
And walked away with a lump in his note
The saddest bell youve ever seen
The Christmas bell called Ding a ling They all call him Ding a ling
Because he has a funny ring
And doesnt hit his note too well
Ding a ling the Christmas bell The snow was falling in the square
When the children found him there
And placed him on the Christmas tree
For everyone in town to see As Christmas Eve came to the town
A blinding snow was coming down
And Ding a ling heard someone say
Old Santas sure to lose his way The thought occurred to ding a ling
To ring as loud as He could ring
And when old Santa heard the sound
It guided him into the town Now the children shout and sing
And everyone loves Ding a ling
So everything has turned out well
For Ding a ling the Christmas bell (Vince Gill) There's an angel in us all
A little voice inside that answers every call
There's a joyous sound resounding in your heart
A ray of hope that shines as bright as any star Remember... For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings
So show you care and share your light
And help an angel fly tonight An act of kindness, a tender smile
These little blessings seem to make it all worth while
So try and do what's ringing true inside your heart Remember... For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings
So show you care and share your light
And help an angel fly tonight (Another angel) Everybody sing
(Another angel) It's a wonderful life
For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings Say you believe in what you are
Share the love that's ringing true inside your heart Remember... For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings
So show you care and share your light
And help an angel fly tonight (Another angel) Everybody sing
(Another angel) It's a wonderful life
For each and every bell that rings
Another angel gets his wings (Another angel) Everybody sing
(Another angel) It's a wonderful life (Another angel)
(Another angel) It's a wonderful life (Another angel)
(Another angel) (Reba McEntire) At an antique desk
An old man sits alone
It's Christmas Eve
And it's almost time to go He signs his name to a letter he just wrote
Then he reads it back with a voice as soft as snow I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child
A world where hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love Then he walks outside
And he climbs up on his sleigh
And calls out to his reindeer
Off they fly away
Oh tonight he'll make a million dreams appear
While he wishes that his own dreams would come true this year I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child
A world where hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love A world where hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE BIT OLD FASHIONED
AND IT MAY NOT BE THE TREND OF THE YEAR.
BUT LET'S TAKE THE STORE BOUGHT FEELING OUT OF CHRISTMAS
AND HAVE THE KIND THAT MAMA HELD SO DEAR. LET'S NOT HAVE A SINGLE PIE IF WE CAN'T MAKE IT
AND I'LL SHARPEN UP THE AX TO CUT OUR TREE.
LET THE LITTLE ONES MAKE ALL THE DECORATIONS
AND GET BACK TO THE WAY IT USED TO BE. LET'S HAVE CHRISTMAS LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE IT
BACK BEFORE WE ALL HAD IT MADE.
LET'S SPEND TIME SPENDING LOVE INSTEAD OF MONEY
TAKE A SLEIGH RIDE BACK INTO THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
FOR IT'S THERE THAT LIES THE STRENGTH OF OUR FAMILY
THE GOOD LORD INTENDED IT THIS WAY.
SO THIS YEAR LET'S DO OUR BEST NOT TO FAKE IT
LETS HAVE CHRISTMAS LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE IT.
LET'S CALL UNCLE ED TO TUNE THAT OLD PIANO
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG SINCE WE'VE ALL SANG SILENT NIGHT.
LET THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE IT THEIR WAY
BUT THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA DO IT RIGHT.
LET'S HAVE CHRISTMAS LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE IT
BACK BEFORE WE ALL HAD IT MADE.
LET'S SPEND TIME SPENDING LOVE INSTEAD OF MONEY
TAKE A SLEIGH RIDE BACK INTO THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
FOR IT'S THERE THAT LIES THE STRENGTH OF OUR FAMILY
THE GOOD LORD INTENDED IT THIS WAY.
SO THIS YEAR LET'S DO OUR BEST NOT TO FAKE IT
LET'S HAVE CHRISTMAS LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE IT. (Toby Keith) My billfold doesn't have a prayer
There's Christmas catalogs everywhere
She keeps looking at the jewelry section
Cutting pictures out of her selections I said we need to hold it down this year
And in her eye she got a big ol' tear
She wants a Christmas rock
But Santas pockets ain't got no roll She don't want pots and pans
Just something shinin' on her hand
With an emerald or a diamond on it
I had a budget but she's gone and blown it
Down to the jewelry store, here I go
Hear the clerk say, ho, ho, ho
She wants a Christmas rock
But Santas pockets ain't got no roll She don't want anything from sears
No tools or garden shears
There's something special on her mind
And I can't even afford the shine I wish she'd settled for a long nightshirt
No, Ive got to give till it hurts
She wants a Christmas rock
But Santas pockets ain't got no roll She don't want pots and pans
Just something shinin' on her hand
With an emerald or a diamond on it
I had a budget but she's gone and blown it
Down to the jewelry store, here I go
Hear the clerk say, ho, ho, ho
She wants a Christmas rock
But Santas pockets ain't got no roll She wants a Christmas rock
But ol' Santas pockets ain't got no roll (Clint Black) (Chorus:)
Youre as slow as christmas, I was up before the dawn
Up so fast I missed it or was that old saying wrong
Every christmas day makes every other day seem long
And what seemed would never get here
Has so quickly come and gone Ive heard old sayings, old cliches and
Most of them make sense
But were wiser in our younger days not easily convinced
Theres no way to look ahead with the wool over your eyes
And it seems that santas sled isnt the only thing that flies (Chorus) Were bringing in another year lets throw the old one back
With my new train Ill be the engineer
And hurry down the track
While I know that time is standing still
I hear that old cliche
And Im more convinced it does until that
One december day (Chorus 2x) When Im as slow as christmas
Ill be up before the dawn
Im gonna miss this
I know that old sayings wrong
Every christmas day makes other day seem long
And what seemed would never get here
Has so quickly come and gone,
Come and gone (Alabama) Snowy days and frosty night, everything looks cold and white
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, hangin' 'round the mistletoe Christmas day will soon be here, and everybody's full of cheer
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear Well, I've waited all year long and nore the year is almost gone
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, hangin' 'round the mistletoe But if that's what I've gotta do just to get a kiss from you
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear Christmas is a special time to give and to receive
For every little kiss you give me I will give you three You ain't gonna miss one kiss, that's one thing you'll never miss
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletow waitin' for you dear Well, I've had my eyes on you for a long, long time
So, I'm asking Santa please, make that pretty girl mine Waited till I'm cold and blue just to get a kiss from you
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear Early one Christmas morning..
ever so long ago..
The brightness of stars in heaven..
shown down on the earth below.. Shepherd's and wise men together..
offered their treasures its told..
and yet there was one so humble..
who gave neither silver nor gold.. I am just a lonely shepherd boy..
no earthly riches have I..
but the love and devotion I give thee..
will last till the waters run dry.. Though treasures of shepherd's and wise men..
ashes to ashes have gone..
the gift of a poor humble shepherd boy..
in the spirit of Christmas lives on.... The love and devotion of a poor shepard boy..
in the spirit of Christmas lives on.... I (Joe Diffie) Turn out the lights
We just need the lights from the tree
The kids are in bed
Baby it's just you and me
Side by side, the fire is bright, on this oh so blessed night The gifts lying there
Cannot compare to the love you give
Sealed with a kiss
For as long as I live
Ribbons and bows, could never show, all that I want you know I want to take you in my arms tonight
And keep the fire burning bright
'Cause if the best things in life are free
There's nothing you could buy for me
Your presence is enough
Wrap me in your love Look into the night
There's a star in the sky that I see
It's come so far
To shine its light for you and me
As if it know, I'm holding you close, underneath the mistletoe I want to take you in my arms tonight
And keep the fire burning bright
'Cause if the best things in life are free
There's nothing you could buy for me
Your presence is enough
Wrap me in your love Your presence is enough
Wrap me in your love (Steve Wariner) Ol' December's here at last
Time for celebration
Christmas present
Christmas past
Tumble down together like the snow
What a show
Now the snowman Karen made
Is melting by the roadside
On the wind a serenade
Of children's voices singing I believe
I believe in love
I believ On Christmas morning
You awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms
We watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me and I realize how sweet a life can be
All the memories
Coming back again this year Sentimental melodies
surround me like an old friend
Spent a winter here with me
Silently we watched the seasons change
And they change so fast
Fade away On Christmas morning
You awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms
We watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me
And I realize how sweet a life can be
All the memories will always take me back, hold me back in time On Christmas morning
You awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms
We watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me
And I realize how sweet a life can be
Ooh the memories will always take me back in time
To Christmas morning
On Christmas morning The girl at the grocery she's pretty and seems nice
But she looks right through me with eyes cold as ice
She never answers when I ask her name
She only says I should have a great day But hey what could she mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool she takes me for
Not anything more I guess it's the season the time of the year
When people they're happy and full of good cheer
Well they'll wish you and kiss you and wish you again
And they'll tell you it's peace and good will to all men But hey what could they mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool they take me for
Not anything more We stood at the altar and you held my hand
And everyone watched as the preacher he asked
Will you take him and love him for bad and for good
You looked at me then you told him you would But hey what did you mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool you take me for
Not anything more Now each Christmas morning I sit in my chair
And I look up at the angels that float through the air
Some look down upon me, some come to my side
And they tell me that Jesus he said to say hi (Dwight Yoakam) Come on Christmas
Please take me away
Keep me hidden safe
'Til January's second day
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel I'll wrap myself
Up in the cheer
That's so abundant
This time of year
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel Even though it's just September
I can forget to remember
All the empty nights
Still in my way Come on Christmas
Embrace me with some joy
'Til the last few lonely moments
Of this year have been destroyed
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel I'll just let visions of the season
Blind these worn-out sights
Still in my mind
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel
Come on Christmas (Dolly Parton) You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave
Christmas to remember, too good to believe
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind And you've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember We loved and laughed and played and joked
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes
Then to the lodge for dinner
But now it's time for us to go
As our hearts melt like chimney snow
There's just one thing I want to know
Can we do this next winter
Oh! What a Christmas to remember You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
