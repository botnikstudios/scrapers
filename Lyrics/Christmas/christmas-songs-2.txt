Mary had a little lamb
One holy morning
'Neath the star of Bethlehem
A brand new day was forming
Guided by the shining light
And the angel's voice
Wise men traveled through the night
To see the baby boy 'Cause Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God They gathered 'round to see the lamb
In the manger sleeping
Such a humble throne for Him
The promise God was keeping
There the shepards bowed their heads
Among the cattle lowing
The first ever Christmas gift
Was wrapped in swaddling clothes Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God For the world a sacrifice
Mary did give birth
The way she held him in her arms
Is how He holds the earth Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God Oh, Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God Jesus our brother kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the friendly beasts around him stood
Jesus our brother kind and good "I" said the donkey shaggy and brown
I carried his mother up hill and down
I carried him safely to Bethlehem town
"I" said the donkey shaggy and brown And "I" said the cow all white and red
I gave him my manger for a bed
I gave him my hay for to pillow his head
"I" said the cow all white and red "I" said the sheep with a curly horn
I gave him my wool for his blanket warm
And he wore my coat on that Christmas morn
"I" said the sheep with a curly horn "I" said the dove from the rafters high
Cooed him to sleep that he should not cry
We cooed him to sleep my love and I
"I" said the dove from the rafters high And "I" said the camel all yellow and black
Over the desert upon my back
I brought him a gift in the wise men's pack
"I" said the camel all yellow and black Thus every beast remembering it well
In the stable dark was so proud to tell
Of the gifts that they gave Emmanuel
The gifts that they gave Emmanuel Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?
Mary Did you know
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary Did you know
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little boy
You've kissed the face of God Mary, did you know?
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary Did you know
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the Great I Am Out of all the reindeers
You know you're the mastermind

Threw his old pack right over his back
Opened the windows of his little shack
And shouted "Oh Dasher and Dancer

We're gonna get a-goin' and spread some cheer
So limber your legs and sharpen your hooves
'Cause tonight is the night
We're gonna jump on the roof Well the reindeer they were so proud and grand
To take another trip all over the land
They jumped right into their proper place
To get hepped up for that midnight race Ol' Santa he shook off the ice and snow
Boarded his sleigh and then yelled "let's go"
All the little toys were happy too
Because they were so bright and new
A little piano then started to play
Santa began to swing and sway
Thought he heard a toy drum startin' to beat
But he found it was the rhythm of the reindeer feet The reindeer boogied in the middle of the road
Tonight we have a mighty big load
Don't boogie to the left now boogie to the right
Do the reindeer boogie this Christmas Eve night The reindeer boogied in the middle of the road
Tonight we have a mighty big load
Don't boogie to the left now boogie to the right
Do the reindeer boogie this Christmas Eve night Santa had a cup of coffee
And he ate a little snack
Mmm-hmmmm, mmm-hmmmm
Vixen and Blizten come on
Mmm-hmmmm, mmm-hmmmm (Alan Jackson) Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the hearts of all people both near and afar
Christmas everywhere
Feel the love of the season wherever you are
On the small country roads lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere Let it be Christmas everywhere
With the gold and the silver, the green and the red
Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow
Elderlys' memories that never grow old Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing and the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means and what we believe
From the sandy white beaches where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas

Ohhh noooo Love is a Christmas tree

And it drank drank drank
But it kept on getting drier
Now it burns burns burns
This tree's on fire
This tree's on fire June call 9-1-1
June
Ohhh The heat from the smokin' pine
Melted my copy of Walk The Line
And I tried to save A Boy Named Sue
Dang it cooked him too The cat walked in
Set my Christmas tree on fire
He climbed climbed climbed
Hit some bulbs
And stripped the wires
:(Meows)
:That's when I learned learned learned
This tree's on fire
This tree's on fire Damn cats I go into my Christmas tree of fire
And I huffed and huffed and spit
But the flames would not expire
Boy it burns burns burns

Santas on his way Santas on his way
Santas on his way Well I've been sorta worried
About Santa Claus this year
Cause we live way down south
And it didn't snow down here
But I'm telling you not to worry
Cause I just got the word
Everybody listen closely
And I'll tell you what I heard Santa's comin in a pickup
Instead of his trusty sleigh
He'll have a truck instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
Cause the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see Santa's gonna come in a pickup truck
When he visits you and me Santa can't bring his reindeer
He'll leave them far away
But don't you worry 'bout him
He's gonna be here Christmas day
He's got a big red pickup
With four-wheel drive and all
And there's gonna be a Merry Christmas
A Merry Christmas for all Santa's gonna come in a pick up truck
When he visits you and me Rumors emanating
From the North to all the Poles
Outsiders speculating
Who's designing Santa's clothes
He's the newest face in Christmas
And soon the world will know
That Rudolph's nose
Is not the only reindeer appendage that glows... Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa should he call him queer He's standing tall
Against the wall
Of prejudice and fear
He's Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer Well he came out of the forest
And that's why he's on the news
And ever since that legislation's changed
Now they can't make poor Stephon
Join in all those stupid stupid reindeer games Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa should he call him queer Prancer up in front of him
He's got Blitzen to the rear
He's Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer He's embarrassed by his antlers
He retains progesterone
And in his mind he looks like Doris Day
And if the health plan springs for surgery
Some day
You know he really may Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer
Heaven help Santa should he call him queer He's standing tall
Against the wall
Of prejudice and fear
He's Stephon the alternative lifestyle reindeer Affirmative reaction
The world is on it's ear
Hey that speech that Jesse Jackson made
Brought Rush Limbaugh to tears
And he'll go down in history
For months or even years
He's Stephon
(Stephon)
The alternative lifestyle reindeer. Oh, the fire's burning slow
Now where's that mistletoe
Dear, it's getting kind of hot in here
I need a taste of Christmas cheer
I hope he gets here quick, I need a St. Nick fix
Oooo-eee, I just want him to be all wrapped up for me
Santa's never been this hard to resist
But Santa never used to look like this He's traded in his reindeer for a limosine
He's wearing purple trousers instead of red and green
This Christmas I want something I never had
Cause Santa's got a brand new bag Now, I got to got to find out how
To make him want to settle down
I've got a big fat kiss right at the top of my list
So we can build a little candy home
And have a few elves of our own
I want to sneak a peek at my surprise
And see tradition metamorphasize He's given up the cookies and he's slimming down
He bought a little bungalow in Tinsel Town
This Christmas I want something I never had
Cause Santa's got a brand new bag As he finds his Zen down on the kitchen floor
He lights a fat Cohiba from his humidor
This Christmas I want something I never had Cause Santa's got a brand new bag He's got a Richenbacher and he's bleached his hair
He's rockin to the rythm with a Latin flair
This Christmas I want something I've never had
Cause Santa's got a brand new bag He's reading Socrates and cooking French cuisine
He's pictured on the front of money magazine
This Christmas I want something I've never had
Cause Santa's got a brand new
Santa's got, Santa's got a brand new bag Last night I dreamed I was kid again
All the things I used to do I went and did again
Spent the afternoon with my best and closest friend
Wanderin' through the days we thought would never end
It was back when I'd still get things from Santa Claus
Back when he believed in me and overlooked the flaws
That can grow inside until it hides the perfect little boy inside the man I'm not a kid anymore, but I still believe that those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves still make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys Tonight I'll climb back in that bed again
Try to live out all my dreams inside my head again
After Christmas Eve with my best and closest friend
Who still believes the world's greatest dad just tucked him in
And I know that he'll be looking out for Santa Claus
And I'm sure beyond a doubt he'll overlook the flaws
That will grow inside until it hides this perfect little boy inside a man I'm not a kid anymore and I still believe that miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves do make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys Come they told me
A newborn King is born
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King
So to honor Him
pa rum pum pum pum
When we come Baby Jesus
I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King
Shall I play for you on my drum Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my best for Him
Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum Old Mr. Kringle is soon gonna jingle

Hell make this December the one youll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybodys waiting, theyre all congregating
Waiting for the man with the bag Better watch out now! A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was travelling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolks brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense
And perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring She waited till just before midnight
So no one would see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door and let me see
Though she trembled, she did as He asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring up into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offerings was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song Ribbons and paper cover the floor, it's been a great Christmas with presents galore
Everyone's happy and I'm happy, too
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you Frost on the window, snow on the ground, holiday spirit, holiday sounds
Everyone's thankful and I'm thankful, too
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you It all started underneath that mistletoe when we were waiting up just to help ole Santa Claus
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of
When we heard those sleigh bells and ole Santa almost caught us We didn't take no pictures,
But I still remember one very special twenty-fourth day of December
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
It all started underneath that mistletoe while we were waiting up to help ole Santa Clause
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of
When we heard those sleigh bells and ole Santa almost caught us If we don't do this nect year, honey, I'm sure gonna miss it
Why don't we make it a new Yuletide tradition
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you The city's decorated up for Christmas
All the stores are open late tonight
People hurry through the frozen streets
I take a walk Every child has a thousand wishes
Every window has a thousand lights
Every soul has a need for peace
I take a walk There's a star that still outshines the night
You can find it if you close your eyes
And see the light Take a walk through Bethlehem
Come and kneel before the Lamb
Good news for every man
Walk though Bethlehem Every night another tv special
Merchants counting down the shopping days
But something's missing underneath the tree
I take a walk 'Cause every heart longs for more than tinsel
Something more than just a holiday
Come and celebrate the baby King
Let's take a walk You don't have to travel anywhere
Faith and hope and love will bring you there
Bring you there Take a walk (take a walk) through Bethlehem
Come and kneel (come and kneel) before the Lamb
Good news for every man

Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "yoo hoo",
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, gidd yap,
It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you. There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop. pop! pop! pop! There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffe and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Iives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives! Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "yoo hoo",
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you. It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. The first Nowell, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep. Nowell, Nowell,
Nowell, Nowell,
Born is the King of Israel. They looked up and saw a Star,
Shining in the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth, it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night. Nowell, Nowell,
Nowell, Nowell,
Born is the King of Israel. The star drew nigh to the North-West,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did, both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay. Nowell, Nowell,
Nowell, Nowell,
Born is the King of Israel.
(Last time) Nowell, Nowell,
Nowell, Nowell I see the lights of the city tonight and I see a star shinin' so bright
A babe in a manger in swaddling clothes, it's you, it's me everyone knows The Christmas spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere
Like the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been coming down I hear the sound of church bell ring, and I see kids and grown-ups sing
A real live nativity scene, it's you, it's me, we all know what it means The Christman spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere
Like the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been coming down An it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King
It's time for that eastern star to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time Yes, it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King
It's time for that eastern start to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time Since the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been coming down Sweet little Jesus boy
They made you be born in a manger
Sweet little holy child
We didn't know who you were
Didn't know you'd come to save us Lord
To take our sins away
Our eyes were blind, we could not see
We didn't know who you were Long time ago
You were born
Born in a manger Lord
Sweet little Jesus boy
The world treats you mean Lord
Treats me mean too
But that's how things are down here
We don't know who you are You have told us how
We are trying
Master you have shown us how
Even when you were dying
Just seems like we can't do right
Look how we treated you
But please Sir forgive us Lord
We didn't know it was you Sweet little Jesus boy
Born a long time ago
Sweet little holy child
We didn't know who you were Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you On a cold night, late December
As the snow fell to earth
That's the one night, we remember
When a woman gave birth
And for miles and miles around
The baby's cry was the only sound Did He know the world was filled with pain
Could He feel all the hunger and the shame
Or did He know about the way He would die
And the reason why
Is that what made the baby cry?
Is that what made the baby cry? As his Mother turned to hold Him
Her face filled with joy
He grew quiet when She told Him
He was more than just her baby boy
And for miles and miles around
Her lullaby was the only sound Did She know the world was filled with pain
Could She feel all the hunger and the shame
Or did She know about the way He would die
And the reason why
Is that what made Her baby cry?
Is that what made Her baby cry? And as He fell asleep
She wiped away His tears
But the question still remains
Have we changed in two thousand years Don't you know the world is still in pain
Can't you feel all the hunger and the shame
Did we forget about the way that He died
And the reason why
Would we still make the baby cry?
Would we still make the baby cry? Come on weather man give us a forecast snowy white
Can't you hear the prayers of every childlike heart tonight
Rockies are callin', Denver snow fallin'
Somebody said it's four feet deep, but it doesn't matter
Give me the laughter, I'm gonna choose to keep Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only Chirstmas for me
Where the love circles around us like the gifts around our tree
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me Every now and then I get a wanderin' urge to see
Maybe California, maybe Tinsel Town's for me
There's a parade there, we'd have it made there
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve
Sure sounds exciting, awfully inviting, still I think I'm gonna keep Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only Christmas for me
Where the love circles around us like the gifts around our tree
Well they say in L.A. it's a warm holiday, it's the only place to be
A tender Tennessee Christmas, is the only Christmas for me Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me
A tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me It happened one day near December's end
Two neighbors called on an old friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with a thousand bows of green
And Conrad was sittin' with face ashined
When he suddenly stopped as he stiched a twine
And he said "Oh friends at dawn today
When the cock was crowin' the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And said 'I'm comin' your guest to be.'
So I've been busy with feet astir
And strewin' my shop with branches of fir
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined
Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear His step
As He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and look on His face"
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he'd known
For long since his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas day
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision he'd had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearin' a sound
But all he could see on the snow-covered ground
Was a shabby begger who's shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn
But Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said "You know, your feet must be frozen and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that'll keep you warmer too"
So with grateful heart, the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait
When he heard a knock he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent ol' lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindlin' piled on her back
She asked for only a place to rest
But that was reserved for Conrad's great guest
But her voice seemed to plead "Don't send me away
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas day"
So Conrad brewed her a steamin' cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup
But after she left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slippin' away
And the Lord hadn't come as He said He would
And Conrad felt sure he'd misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
"Please help me, and tell me where am I!"
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas day
Again, Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears
Then he led her back to her home once more
But as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not comin' today
For the hours of Christmas had passed away
So he went to his room and he knelt down to pray
And he said "Dear Lord, why did You delay?
What kept You from comin' to call on me?
For I wanted so much Your Face to see"
When soft in the silence, a voice he heard
"Lift up your head, for I kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
And three times I came to your lonely door
I was the begger with bruised, cold feet
And I was the woman you gave somethin' to eat
I was the child on the homeless street.
Three times I knocked and three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts love is the best
And I was honored to be your Christmas guest." My little boy was a wise man this year
His Christmas play was something I couldn't miss
Between the shopping and my job I barely got there
My faith was worn from stress and strain
Until those little Angels sang (hallelujah)
To the King (people rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the angels sang (hallelujah)
And they sang (people rejoice) And as I watched those innocent children
I felt the greatness of that holy night
And for a moment I was right there with those wise men
So overwhelmed with love and light I had to cry when the Angels sang (hallelujah)
To the King (people rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the angels sang (hallelujah)
And they sang (people rejoice) Angels sang (hallelujah)
To the King (people rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the angels sang (hallelujah)
And they sang (people rejoice) Hey, the old man's back in town

Ooooh.... On a night so long ago
By the light of one bright star
Two weary travelers far from Galilee
Took refuge in a stable
Where a little child was born
To bring the gift of love, to you and me
When the angels told the shepherds of His birth
There came a great rejoicing on the earth. And they sang, glory to God in the highest
Dawning that first Christmas morn
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy
For unto you this night a child is born. And, lo, these many years since then
That ancient star still guides us
And now again our Christmas voices ring
Blessed we are and safe at home
With loved ones her beside us
And in the still and silent night we sing
How the angels told the shepherds of his birth
And there came a great rejoicing on the earth And they sang, glory to God in the highest
Dawning that first Christmas morn
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy
For unto you this night a child is born. Now I'm only five years old
I've got to do just what I'm told
'cause Santa Claus is gonna be dropping in on me
Now is there something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree.
Now I know what he like for a late night snack
For years now it's been bringing him back
Milk and cookies
He'll come and go without a sound again
But how in the world does he get in
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
Try to sleep it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's Gone I just can't wait
Now is there something I might have missed I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can get it all under that Christmas tree.
Sneak a peek down the hall
I've got to check Now I don't recall
the milk and cookies
I think I'm sure I got it all
Stockings hung a-long the wall
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
I gotta sleep now it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's Gone I just can't wait
Just can't wait, just can't wait
Could there be something I might have missed
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree.
I hope he can fit it all under my Christmas tree. spoken:
Let's see, I know he can fit...he can fit the airplane under there.
He can get the bicycle in there and the...
And the gum ball machine and don't know what he's gonna do with that horse. What a merry Christmas this could be
If you would just come back to me
And say that you've forgiven me
What a merry Christmas this could be It was just last Christmas
That we quarreled and you walked out
I knew I was wrong
But you'd come back
I had no doubt
Now a year has rolled around
It's Christmas once again
And what I'd give if you'd come walkin' in What a merry Christmas this could be
If you would just come back to me
And say that you've forgiven me
What a merry Christmas this could be What a merry Christmas this could be
If you would just come back to me
And say that you've forgiven me
What a merry Christmas this could be What a merry Christmas this could be Maybe its much too early in the game

What are you doing New Years
New Years Eve? Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When its exactly twelve oclock that night

When its exactly twelve oclock that night
Welcoming in the New Year

Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear the sleighbells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry
And bright
And may all your Christmases be white Well, I'm glad little Johnny wants that remote control
I know I'm gonna run it fast as it will go
And Jenny wants every game that Nintendo makes
It's just around the corner and I can't wait I've got my stocking hangin', it's time to go to bed
I think I hear some reindeer, I better cover up my head
I know Santa's gonna bring us something just like he always did
Yeah, when it comes to Christmas I'm still a kid I still like shakin' presents underneath the tree
And tryin' to figure out what ole Santa's got for me
Oh, I get so excited on Christmas Eve
I try my best to close my eyes, but I can't sleep Well, I've got my stocking hangin', its time to go to bed
I think I hear some reindeer, I better cover up my head
I know Santa's gonna bring us something just like he always did
Yeah, when it comes to Christmas I'm still a kid When it comes to Christmas, I'm still a kid
Just a kid Where are you Christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh

If you care, oh If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here in silence
Fills each and every heart with love Where are you Christmas
Fills your heart with love Got a wife and two kids, all gathered around
A twenty-pound turkey, snow on the ground
Who says there aint no Santa Claus Eric wants a glove, he tears into a box
His eyes are wide with wonder,
I sit back and watch
Who says there aint no Santa Claus I havent heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my childrens eyes and there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says theres no Santa Claus Molly gets a doll, Mommas camera clicks
Guess we all get the puppy, hes getting in his licks
Who says there aint no Santa Claus Im trying to read a card in crooked red and blue
Only part that really matters is "Daddy, we love you"
Who says there aint no Santa Claus I havent heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my childrens eyes and there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says theres no Santa Claus Hey, Ive heard there aint no Santa Claus
But I know theres got to be a Santa Claus She smiles at him, he says, "Hello"
They stand beneath the mistletoe
Embarrassed by the awkward circumstance He asks her if shed like a drink
She says, "I better not I think
Oh, what the heck, maybe just one glass" They talk about, oh, this and that
He says, "I like the way you laugh
And Im so really glad youre here" Then suddenly its much too warm
She feels his hand against her arm
The season loves the reason for romance
Itll get you if you give it half a chance The night goes on, the music plays
A moonlight Christmas serenade
A lovers song thats meant for only two And they dont even know it yet
But this is one theyll not forget The holiday where all their dreams came true
Across the floor he spins her around
Oh, could it be theyve finally found
A love worth waiting for Then in the tender yuletide bliss
They share an unexpected kiss
The season loves the reason for romance
Itll get you if you give it half a chance Then suddenly the night is gone
Its late into an early morn
The season loves the reason for romance
Itll get you if you give it half a chance Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock. The factories are all shut down and the shopping malls are all closed
And the busy streets are all empty except for the falling snow
And in the small towns, in the cities families gather as one
'Cause the night of love and sharing they look forward to has come 'Cause tonight is Christmas, tonight is love
Tonight we celebrate God's one and only Son
Tonight there's hope for peace on earth eternally
Tonight is Christmas and the world's in harmony But across the seas two armies stare down at each other's guns
Each believing in their cause enough to die or kill the other one
But tonight there'll be no shooting, not a drop of blood will spill
They will cease their fire this silent night in the name of peace and goodwill 'Cause tonight is Christmas, tonight is love
Tonight we celebrate God's one and only Son
Tonight there's hope for peace on earth eternally
Tonight is Christmas and the world's in harmony One day a mother went to a prison
To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done She did not bring to him
A parole or pardon (free)
She brought no silver (brought no gold)
No pomp nor style (longed to see)
It was a halo bright
Sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile She left a smile you can remember
She's gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those walls around you could never change her
You were her baby and ere will be She did not bring to him
A parole or pardon (free)
She brought no silver (brought no gold)
No pomp nor style (longed to see)
It was a halo bright
Sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile It was a halo bright
Sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile We were alone in the fields with our sheep
A star in the sky glowing bright in the east
When an angetlic choir singing all glory be
To God in the highest, bade us come see (they said) The way in a manger is a babe fast asleep
He's never a stranger to wise men who seek
The light and the hope for all of mankind
He's the way in the manger
And He's easy to find Mary and Joseph were there when we came
And all that the angels had said was the same
And when I saw the baby I knew just what to do
I bowed down to worship the light and the truth The way in a manger is a babe fast asleep
He's never a stranger to wise men who seek
The light and the hope for all of mankind
He's the way in the manger
And He's easy to find The light and the hope
For all of mankind
He's the way in a manger
And He's easy to find When you said that yesterday

And he was looking for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
Now in Pennsylvania folks are traveling

When an angel of the Lord
Said, "Seek the Savior born"
Logic told them they were crazy
They shouldn't even try
The followed their hearts, they followed that star
This Christmas, let me be that wise 2,000 years ago, Mary left her home
An angel said, "Have faith"
The Lord will light your way
The road was long and winding
But a promise had been made
>From heaven above, that was enough
This Christmas, let me keep that faith This Christmas, let this be the season
Of peace and love, joy and true believing
2,000 years ago, as everybody knows
A perfect baby lay
Asleep there in the hay
The world would not believe Him
But he loved them all so much
On that first night, He was the light
This Christmas, let me feel that love Keep that faith, be that wise, feel that love
This Christmas Presents underneath the tree
Candles burning bright
Stockings hung with lots of care
On this silent Christmas night

Just seeing you
To be here with you Oh this Christmas time

The greatest gift in life
Is you and me together
And I thank heaven for sending you here tonight

Where everything glitters
Tinseltown
All sparkle and shimmer
Look around and see the brightest stars come out
In Tinseltown, in Tinseltown Three King manger scene, glowing on the front lawn

Finally round midnight ( all is calm, all is bright)
Then magically we all wake up
( Once a year we all wake up )
And find ourselves here in our own Tinseltown
Where everything glitters
Tinseltown
All sparkle and shimmer
Look around and see the brightest stars come out
In Tinseltown, in Tinseltown Tinseltown
Where everything glitters
Tinseltown
All sparkle and shimmer
Look around and see the brightest stars come out
In Tinseltown, in Tinseltown Tinseltown
Tinseltown, Tinseltown
Tinsel all the way (Dolly Parton) I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
I've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories brought joy to other's lives
It's Christmas time again another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing jingle bells around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down this Christmas I'll be home I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on (Dolly Parton) I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I'll tell you why I do
'Cause I believe that dreams and plans and wishes can come true
I believe in miracles, I believe in magic too
Oh I believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you I believe in family, in country and in smiles
I believe in turnin' negatives to positives in life
I believe in lookin' farther up the farther down we get
I believe when someone hurts us we should forgive and forget And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe love should prevail at any cost
And I believe in Santa Claus I believe in saying what you mean and meaning what you say
I believe a better attitude can make a better way
And I believe in viewing life as a journey that we're on
And lookin' at our troubles as another stepping stone And I believe that everything in life is what it's meant to be
I believe there is a God somewhere although he's hard to see
I believe I am so therefore I should do all that I can
To be a better piece in the puzzle of God's plan And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus Let the little children sing it I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus

It's the middle of December there's excitement eveywhere Everyone's invited, the celebration's planned
The gift is just what's in your heart and not what's in your hand Who's the one we need to thanks
Who's the party for
Who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joesph and Mary's boy There were times we didn't think we'd make it through the year
The bankers tried to take our farms but somehow we're still here I don't know how the crops survived the drought and then the rain
It must have been a miracle how else could you explain Who's the one we need to thanks
Who's the party for
Who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joesph and Mary's boy The Christ Child born in Bethlehem
He was Joesph and Mary's boy Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing. Joy to the world, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy. No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found. He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders, of His love. Well you've all heard the story
About Rudolph and his nose
Well I'll tell you a Christmas tell
That never has been told
Well you may think you've heard it all
But you ain't heard nothin' yet
About that crazy Christmas
That the North Pole can't forget Rudolph was under the weather
And had to call in sick
So he got on the horn
To his cousin Leroy
Who lived out in the sticks
He said Santa's really counting on me
And I hate to pass the buck
Leroy said Hey I'm on my way
And he jumped in his pick-up truck
When Leroy got to the North Pole
All the reindeer stiggered and laughed
They never seen a deer in overalls
And a John Deer tracktor hat
Well Santa stepped in
And said just calm down
Cuz we all got a job to do
Like it or not Leroy's in charge
And he's gonna be leading you
And it was Leroy The Redneck Reindeer
Hooked to the front of the sleigh
Delivering toys to all the good ol' boys
And girls along the way
He's just a down home party animal
Two Steppin all across the sky
He makes jingle bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night Before that night was over
Leroy had changed there tune
He had them scootin a holf
On every single roof
By the light of a neon moon
Santa wrapped his bad with the dixie flag
He as having the time of his life
You could here him call
Merry Chistmas Yall
And all of yall a goodnight
And it was Leroy The Redneck Reindeer
Hooked to the front of the sleigh
Delivering toys to all the good ol' boys
And girls along the way
He's just a down home party animal
Two Steppin all across the sky
He makes jingle bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night He makes Jingle Bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong The weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Oh, since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Well it doesn't show signs of stopping
But we've got some corn for popping
And the lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But as long as you hold me tight
Woah all the way home I'll be warm Well the fire is slowly dying
But my dear we're still goodbye-ing
And as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow (let it snow)
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow (let it snow) When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But as long as you hold me tight
Hoah all the way home I'll be warm Oh the fire is slowly dying
But my dear we're still goodbye-ing
And as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow (let it snow)
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Thru the deep snows of uncertain winter descending
With Joseph I wander, with Mary I ride
Toward the promise that waits
At their harsh journey's ending
Those of humble estate shall in mansions abide Sprinkle some glitter on magazine angels
Use matchsticks and clothespins to build Bethlehem
Make the star in the East from a piece of tin foil
Look for the child within
Let Jesus be born again Now who will be greatest in the kingdom of Heaven
The least of all children, the greatest shall be
So turn not away from the poor and forgotten
And always remember, his favorites are these Sprinkle some glitter on magazine angels
Use matchsticks and clothespins to build Bethlehem
Make the star in the East from a piece of tin foil
Look for the child within
Let Jesus be born again The gifts that we bring unto loved ones and strangers
Also we bring to the babe in the manger So come all ye faithfull, ye shepherds and kings
Look for the child within
Let Jesus be born again
Let Jesus be born again (Toby Keith ) You should see all the lights in our old neighborhood
I never thought that little street could ever look so good
I knew that she'd be busy, it's her favorite time of the year
And I don't think she notice, I slipped off to be here Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
God knows if she could see us now, she wouldn't understand
But Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to take that chance Don't the snow sure look pretty, as the flakes are fallin' down
It's a blanket from heaven coverin' the ground
And that cold wind can cut a man clear to the bone
I guess it's time I got up and took myself back home Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
God knows if she could see us now, she wouldn't understand
But Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to take that chance Well, she's started askin' questions
Though she's barely two
Like, if reindeer fly to heaven
Would Santa bring her love to you Mary, it's Christmas, and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
Someday we'll be together forever, but till then
But Mary, it's Christmas, and Ill do the best I can This cold wind can cut a man clear to the bone
I guess it's time I got up off my knees and took myself back home Mom got drunk and Dad got drunk
At our Christmas party
We were drinkin' champagne punch
And homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him
Til he sang Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife Lynn
And the two identical twins
From his second wife Mary Nell
Of course he brought his new wife Kaye
Who talks all about AA
Chain smokin' while the stereo plays
Noel, Noel, The first Noel Carve the turkey turn the ball game on
Mix Margaritas when the eggnog's gone
Send somebody to the Quik-Pak store
We need some ice and an extension cord
A can of bean dip and some Diet Rite
A box of pampers , some Marlboro Lights
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family Fran and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motor home in
They blew our christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited on our front lawn
He threw the breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night
Oh Silent Night o' holy night Carve the turkey turn the ballgame on
Mix Bloody Marys cause we all want one
Send somebody to the Stop 'n Go
We need some celery and a can of fake snow
A bag of lemons and some Diet Sprite
A box of midol, some Salem Lights
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family Twas the fight before Christmas
When all through the house
No furniture left standing, no TV or couch
Our aquarium, heck they even knocked over my Chia Pet
MeMaw was flung 'cross the room by her hair
By her sister Ethel who never fought fair LET'S GET READY TO TUMBLE!!!!!!! The children all wrestled and jumped off the beds
Dropping elbows and knees on each other's heads
And MaMaw wth her frying pan and Pa with his bat
Cleared half the room in ten seconds flat
The whole brawl began from an innocent matter
When Aunt Flo thought Eugene said "She looks a whole lot fatter"
She knocked him through the window he fell with a crash
Tore down the gutters and busted his LEG REALLY BAD You ought to have saw it
It looked like he'd been in a motorcycle wreck
No Kiddin
Yeah awful I couldn't turn to look at it You see both sides of our family have never gotten along
And every holiday something always go wrong
You ain't supposed to fight but spread joy in this season
But when they get the nog they just look for a reason
In no time at all everybody joined in
And right there we squared off with our closest of kin
It's a time for givin said Uncle Bill
As he gave a black eye to his brother-in-law Phil
I heard somebody say "It's the thought that counts
And right now I'm thinking about knocking your butt out"
Presents and fists flew all over the room
And NaNa had some fancy moves with the broom
She took out three cousins and knocked down the tree
And I ducked just in time she swung out at me It's my favorite time of year
Dad always has too much beer
Gets on the roof and hunts reindeer
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Tie the antlers on the dog
Save some shine for Santa Claus
From all the in-laws and outlaws
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily I crawled to the phone Lord it seemed like a mile
And called 9-1-1 which we keep on speed dial
In a matter of minutes out the window appeared
Flashing blue lights and the Sherrif John Deere
Just then six men burst through the door
Some yelling "HAND'S UP" Some "GET ON THE FLOOR"
A stray punch from Grandpa found the sherrif's chin
And just for good measure he clocked him again
It took all 6 cops to get Grandpa in cuffs
You know he gets feisty when he runs out of snuff
We all stopped our fighting and cheered Grandpa on
Heck I thought he could take them I guess I was wrong
As they dragged him outside he yelled "I'VE BEEN FRAMED"
He was kicking and screaming and calling them names "You (bleep) You (bleep)
Let me go you (bleep)
You donut eatin stupid (bleep) son of a (bleep)" We stood on the porch as did all our neighbras
Who always took interest in our family's behavior
"Mind your own business" we heard Grandma shout
And "We'll take back the presents and then come bail you out"
By now we'd forgotten what we were fighting for
We were battered and bruised but united once more
Then we all joined hands and sang "Violent Night" Violent Night And we heard Grandpa exclaim as they drove off out of sight:
"Merry Christmas to all...MAN that was a good fight!!!!" Deck your neighbor deck the halls
Tis the season for a brawl
From all of us to all of y'all
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Layin' back in my easy chair
Late last Christmas eve
Silent night, twinkling lights
Presents 'round the tree
I heard my little girl's two bare feet
Comin' down the stairs
She was sad as I looked over
Draggin' her teddy bear She said, now daddy, I had a dream
A little angel came down to me
She wasn't happy like angels ought to be
She was cryin' when she gave me the message
For all the world to hear
You know that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year So, with her head on my shoulder
And her tears mixed with mine
I thought how little baby Jesus
Gets left out at Christmas time
It ain't about the money
Oh, money can't buy love
And I saw the light that Christmas night
With help from up above She said, now daddy, I had a dream
A little angel came down to me
She wasn't happy like angels ought to be
She was cryin' when she gave me the message
For all the world to hear
You know that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year She said that Jesus gets jealous of Santa Claus
Sometimes this time of year Tree's in the corner, the fire's burnin' bright.
Shadows are dancin' in the pale candelight.
Life should be a rainbow, but it's blue:
It won't be Christmas without you. I wrapped up all your presents,
Wrote my name on every card.
I just can't help it, baby,
Takin' this so hard.
You tell me: what's a man to do?
'Cause it won't be Christmas without you. I stare into the flames: all I see is your face.
All this joy an' happiness seems so out of place.
As far as I'm concerned, it's just a day I must get through.
But it won't be Christmas without you. Oh, I wrapped up all your presents,
Wrote my name on every card.
I just can't help it, baby,
I'm takin' this so hard.
You tell me: what's a man to do?
It won't be Christmas without you. Oh, I wrapped up all your presents,
Wrote my name on every card.
I just can't help it, baby,
I'm takin' this so hard.
You tell me: what's a man to do?
It won't be Christmas without you. It won't be Christmas without you. He was her man, she was his wife
And late one winter night
He knelt by her
As she gave birth
But it wasn't his child
It wasn't his child Yet still he took him as his own
And as he watched him grow
It brought him joy
He loved that boy
But it wasn't his child
It wasn't his child But like a father
He was strong and kind and good
And I believe he did his best
It wasn't easy for him
But he did all he could
His son was different from the rest
It wasn't his child
It wasn't his child And when the boy became a man
He took his father's hand
And soon the world all know why
It wasn't his child
It wasn't his child And like his father
He was strong and kind and good
And I believe he did his best
It wasn't easy for him
But he did all he could
He grew up with his hands in wood
And He died with his hands in wood
He was God's child
He was God's child He was her man, she was his wife
And late one winter night
He knelt by her
As she gave birth
But it wasn't his child
It wasn't God's child (George Strait) "This the season for generosity
A time to give and to receive
My Christmas list consists of just one sweet dream.... I know what I want for Christmas this year
I hope my note got to Santa on time
Im a little bit nervous,
Its kind of a big thing Im asking for
I dont know if I deserve it but, boy, if I get it
Ill never ask for anything more
It shines, its new
And its the one wish that I wish would come true
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you We can build a little fire
We can sit and talk for hours
Well just have fun
You can tell me what you did
Christmas morning as a kid
And well talk about all our Christmases to come And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway
Im sure to get a kiss
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow
To complete this singular wish?
It shines, its new
I know what I want and nothin else will do
This year for Christmas I just want to be with you This year for Christmas I just want to be with you" (Alan Jackson) The snow is falling It's Christmas Eve

Little Shelby wears a funny smile on his face
Shelby has a secret
And the secret he must share
He wants to tell somebody
So he tells his teddy bear I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the misteltoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw Mama tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mama kissing Santa Claus last night I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the misteltoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw Mama tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mama kissing Santa Claus last night He raced that engine down the track 'round the tree on Christmas day
I was so amazed my dad would play with trains
I saw a sparkle in his eye,
Then I heard him say, come on son let's play, I was young once, too He washed that Buick faithfully, Lord he kept her clean
I thought that machine meant more to him than me
On the day I turned sixteen he threw me the keys
Said I was young once, too, now she belongs to you He was such a young man then, I'm older than that now
I hope I measure up to him, when the circle comes around I saw him in the attic sittin' cross legged on the floor
With some old photographs, he point and laughed
He said, that's me in that picture, I said, no son, that's your dad
I was young once, too, and looked a lot like you I was young once, too, I was young once, too
Merry Christmas son, I wish your grandpa were here
He was young once, too, and looked like me and you (Billy Gilman) I've gotta get a message off to Santa today

Roof tops covered in snow
Lovers sharing a sleigh ride cuddled close
And their eyes seem to glow Window shopping on main street
Bundled up head to toe
Children are skating around a Christmas tree
I see smiles young and old If everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
If everyday could be Christmas Chruch bells ring in the distance
Peace on earth fills the air
Sidewalk Santas handing out candy canes
I feel love everywhere If everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
If everyday could be Christmas Oh it's that time
We open and give from our hearts
Let love shine brighter than any star Oh if everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
Oh if everyday could be Christmas
If everyday could be Christmas
Yeah if everyday could be Christmas
If everyday could be Christmas If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town
Come summer time
Maybe even California
If we make it through December
We'll be fine Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing's not the greatest
In the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right
For daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas here (Alan Jackson) Well I'm making out my list
For ole St.Nick tonight
But I'm afraid what I want this year
Can't be had But Santa he's the kind
When he makes up his mind
Wishes can come true
And I bet my Christmas stockin'
If my wish don't come knockin'
He's gonna be blue So baby come home
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry
He can't see where he's going
When it's snowing
If there tears in his eyes And don't you know his ho ho ho will be
A sad sad sigh
So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry And don't you know his ho ho ho will be
A sad sad sigh
So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry (Alan Jackson) Today I took some paper from the closet
And wrapped the wedding ring
You left behind
And I addressed it to the man
Who vowed to love you
And on the little card
I wrote these words inside Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me Then I sat down in my chair
And thought about you
About the many reasons why you're gone
And I opened up the present that I gave to me
And realized how much it hurts to be alone Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me
