And open wide our heavenly home I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you. I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents

There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring'
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight! Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh. A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot. A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away. Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead. Feliz Navidad

In Bethlehem in that fair city,
Angels sung e'er with mirth and glee, [Chorus:]
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria. Herdmen beheld these angels bright-
To them appeared with great light,
And said, "God's son is born this night." [Chorus] This King is come to save His kind,
In the Scripture as we find People making lists
Buying special gifts
Taking time to be kind
To one and all
It's that time of year
When good friends
Are dear
And you wish you
Could give more
Than just presents
From a store Why don't you give love
On Christmas day
(On Christmas day)
Oh, even the man
Who has everything
Would be so happy
If you would bring
Him love
On Christmas day
(On Christmas day)
No greater gift
Is there than love People you don't know
Smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air
Of Christmas joy
It's that once a year
When the world's sincere
And you'd like
To find a way
To show the things
That words can't say Why don't you give love
On Christmas day
(On Christmas day)
Oh the man on the street
And the couple upstairs
All need to know
That someone who cares
Give love
On Christmas day
(Christmas day)
No greater gift
Is there than love
What the world
Needs is love
Yes, the world
Needs your love Why don't you give love
On Christmas day
(On Christmas Day)
Oh, every little child
On Santa's knee
Has room for your love
Underneath his tree
Give love
On Christmas day
(Christmas day)
No greater gift
Is there than love
What the world
Needs is love
Yes, the world
Needs your love Give love
On Christmas day
(Christmas day) It's a marshmallow world in the winter,
When the snow comes to cover the ground,
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day,
I wait for it all year round. Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly,
In the arms of the evergreen trees,
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,
It's shining so your nose won't freeze. The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,
The world is your snowball just for a song,
Get out and roll it along. It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
Take a walk with your favourite girl,
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late,
In winter, it's a marshmallow world. The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,
The world is your snowball just for a song,
Get out and roll it along. It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
Take a walk with your favourite girl,
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late,
In winter, it's a marshmallow world,
In winter, it's a marshmallow world,
In winter, it's a marshmallow world Everybody likes to take a holiday

And a happy new year! Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down. When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland. Hey! Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
It's Dominick the donkey.
Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
The Italian Christmas donkey.
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)
Santa's got a little friend,
His name is Dominick.
The cutest little donkey,
You never see him kick.
When Santa visits his paisans,
With Dominick he'll be.
Because the reindeer cannot,
Climb the hills of Italy. Hey! Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
It's Dominick the donkey.
Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
The Italian Christmas donkey.
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da) Jingle bells around his feet,
And presents on the sled.
Hey! Look at the mayor's derby,
On top of Dominick's head.
A pair of shoes for Louie,
And a dress for Josephine.
The labels on the inside says,
They're made in Brooklyn. Hey! Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
It's Dominick the donkey.
Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
The Italian Christmas donkey.
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da) Children sing, and clap their hands,
And Dominick starts to dance.
They talk Italian to him,
And he even understands. Cumpare sing,
Cumpare su,
And dance 'sta tarantel.
When Santa Nicola comes to town,
And brings du ciuccianello. Hey! Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
It's Dominick the donkey.
Chingedy ching,
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)
The Italian Christmas donkey.

(Hee-haw, hee-haw) [Verse 1]
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day.
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.
O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me. [Chorus]
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump,
Look at Frosty go.
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump,
Over the hills of snow. [Verse2]
Ooh Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day,
So he said, "Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away."
Down to the village,
With a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all
Around the square saying,
Catch me if you can.
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"
Mmm Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,
"Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some day." [Chorus]
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump,
Look at Frosty go.
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump Over the hills of snow You know Dasher and prancer
And Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen.
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all? Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(reindeer)
Had a very shiny nose
(like a light bulb)
And if you ever saw it
(saw it)
You would even say it glows
(like a flash light)
All of the other reindeer
(reindeer)
Used to laugh and call him names
(like Pinochio)
They never let poor Rudolph
(Rudolph)
Play in any reindeer games
(like Monopoly) Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
(Ho Ho Ho)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then all the reindeer loved him
(loved him)
And they shouted out with glee
(yippee)
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
(reindeer)
You'll go down in history!"
(like Columbus) Jesus, Jesus
Oh
What a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life, new hope
New joy He brings
Won't you listen
To the angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King Jesus, Jesus

The virgin Mary
Was His mother
And Joseph

Three wise men
Came from afar
They were guided
Bby a shining star
To see King Jesus
Where He lay
In a manger
Filled with hay Jesus, Jesus

And they've frozen up my beard
So we'll lie by the fire
'Til the heat simply melts 'em all away Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas When the snowman brings the snow (when the snowman brings the snow)

He's put a great big smile on somebody's face
So if Santa brings that sleigh (Santa brings that sleigh)
All along the Milky Way (along the Milky Way)
I'll sign my name on the rroftop in the snow
Then he may decide to stay Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oo-oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas Okay you lot - take it! Well, I wish it could be Christmas, every day (Christmas day)

Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night.
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought I was tucked
Up in my bedroom fast asleep. Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white.
Oh, what a laugh it would have been,
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night! C'est la belle nuit de Noel
La neige etend son manteau blanc
Et les yeux leves vers le ciel
A genoux, les petits enfants
Avant de fermer les paupieres
Font une derniere priere. [Refrain:]
Petit papa Noel
Quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.
Mais avant de partir
Il faudra bien te couvrir
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid
C'est un peu a cause de moi. Il me tarde que le jour se leve
Pour voir si tu m'as apporte
Tous les beaux joujoux que je vois en reve
Et que je t'ai commandes. [Refrain:]
Petit papa Noel
Quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.
Mais avant de partir
Il faudra bien te couvrir
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid
C'est un peu a cause de moi. Le marchand de sable est passe
Les enfants vont faire dodo
Et tu vas pouvoir commencer
Avec ta hotte sur le dos
Au son des cloches des eglises
Ta distribution de surprises. Et quand tu seras sur ton beau nuage
Viens d'abord sur notre maison
Je n'ai pas ete tous les jours tres sage
Mais j'en demande pardon. [Refrain]:
Petit papa Noel
Quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.
Mais avant de partir
Il faudra bien te couvrir
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid
C'est un peu a cause de moi. (French carol, ca. 1862) Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply,
Echoing their joyous strains.
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o Shepherds, why this Jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o
Glo-ori-a
In excelsis de-o Hark! how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say,
"Throw cares away."
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air Oh how they pound,
Raising the sound,
O'er hill and dale,
Telling their tale,
Joyf'ly they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas On, on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To ev'ry home [Repeat from the beginning] Ding, dong, ding, dong Adeste Fideles

Jingle bells swing n jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air. What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock. [Verse 1]
Joy to the World, the Lord has come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing. [Verse 2]
Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy. [Verse 3]
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found. [Verse 4]
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders, of His love On the 1st day of Christmas my true love gave to me

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared
And the soul felt its worth
The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, o night divine O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error-pining
Till he appeared
And the soul felt it's worth
The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, o night divine Said the night wind to the little lamb,
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
Do you see what I see
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song, high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
Do you know what I know
In your palace wall, mighty king,
Do you know what I know
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold Said the king to the people everywhere,
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere!
Listen to what I say
The Child, the Child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light Angels from the realms of glory
Wing your flight over all the earth
Ye, who sang creations story
Now proclaim Messiah's birth
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King Shepherds in the fields abiding
Watching over your flocks by night
God with man is now residing
Yonder shines the Infant light
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King Sages leave your contemplations
Brighter visions beam afar
Seek the great Desire of nations
Ye have seen His natal star
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King Saints before the alter bending
Watching long in hope and fear
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King
