Well, I woke up this morning,
And I looked out the door.
I can tell that old milk cow
By the way she lowed. Hold it fellows, that don't move me.
Let's get real, real gone for a change. Well, I woke up this morning
And I looked out the door
I can tell that that old milk cow
I can tell the way she lowed. Well, if you've seen my milk cow,
Please ride her on home.
I ain't had no milk or butter
Since that cow's been gone. Well, I tried to treat you right,
Day by day.
Get out your little prayer book
Get down on your knees and pray.
For you're gonna need,
You're gonna need
your loving daddy's help someday.
Well, then you're gonna be sorry
For treating me this way.
Well, believe me, don't that sun
look good going down?
Well, believe me, don't that sun
look good going down?
Well, don't that old moon look lonesome
When your baby's not around. Well, I tried everything to
get along with you.
I'm gonna tell you what I'm going do.
I'm gonna quit my crying,
I'm gonna leave you alone.
If you don't believe I'm leaving,
you can count the days I'm gone.
I'm gonna leave.
You're gonna need your
loving daddy's help someday. Well, you're gonna be sorry
You treated me this way Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
Smiles and says "Aloha" to his sweetheart Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Close their sleepy eyelids, say "Goodnight" to the sun Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep Try to imagine a house that's not a home
Try to imagine a christmas all alone
That's where I'll be
Since you left me
My tears would melt the snow

It'll be lonely this christmas
Without you to hold

Each time I remember
The day you went away
And how I would listen
To the things you had to say

Are emptyness and lonelyness
And an unlit christmas tree
It'll be lonely this christmas
Without you to hold

When it means so very, very much
It'll be lonely this christmas
Without you to hold

While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love Oh, morning stars together
Proclaim Thy holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on Earth Oh, little town of Bethlehem

A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray, someone will come
To show the way
I believe, I believe I believe above a storm the smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word Everytime I hear a new born baby cry,
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why, I believe Everytime I hear a new born baby cry,
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why, I believe The warden threw a party in the county jail

Everybody in the whole cell block

On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries When no one else can understand me,
when everything I do is wrong,
you give me hope and consolation,
you give me strength to carry on
And you're always there
to lend a hand
in everything I do That's the wonder,
the wonder of you
And when you smile the world is brighter,
you touch my hand and I'm a king,
your kiss to me is worth a fortune, your love for me is everything I guess I'll never know
the reason why
you love me as you do
That's the wonder,
the wonder of you
I guess I'll never know
the reason why
you love me as you do
That's the wonder,
the wonder of you Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train got my baby and gone Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, comin' 'round the bend
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again (no, not again) Train train, comin' down, down the line
Train train, comin' down the line
Well, it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine all, all mine
(She's mine, all, all mine) Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend ('round, 'round the bend)
Train train, comin' 'round the bend ('round the bend)
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again (no, never will again) It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait. When I first saw you
with your smile so tender
My heart was captured
my soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
waiting for the right time
Now that your near
the time is here at last. It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait. Just like a willow
we would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
let your arms invite me
For who knows when
we'll meet again this way It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait
it's now or never
My love won't wait. Well, since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street
at Heartbreak Hotel. Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die. And although it's always crowded,
you still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
do cry away their gloom. Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die. Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',
and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back. Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die. Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
and you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
to Heartbreak Hotel. You'll be so lonely, baby
You'll be so lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die Although its always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
to cry away the blues Heartbreak is so lonely, baby
It is so lonely
They'll be so lonely, they could die Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waitin' out there
And they're all livin' devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
'Cause even if there were forty more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashin'
And your one arm bandits crashin'
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime
Turnin' night into daytime
If you see it once you'll never be the same again
I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke up well
I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas
Viva, viva Las Vegas Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me When I think of how he came so far from glory
Came to dwell among the lowly such as i
To suffer shame and such disgrace
On mount calvary take my place
Then I ask myself this question
Who am i? Who am I that the king would bleed and die for?
Who am I that he would pray not my will, thine lord?
The answer I may never know
Why he ever loved me so
That to an old rugged cross he'd go
For who am i? When I'm reminded of his words
I'll leave you never
If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever
Oh I wonder what I could have done
To deserve god's only son
To fight my battles until they're won
For who am i? Who am I that the king would bleed and die for
Who am I that he would pray not my will, thine lord
The answer I may never know
Why he ever loved me so
That to an old rugged cross he'd go
For who am i?
That to an old rugged cross he'd go, for who am i? We are traveling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store) Oh when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
Oh lord I want to be in that number

Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere

(Oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
Oh, let me be
(Oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
I just wanna be your teddy bear Are you lonesome tonight,
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight? I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart. Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I'll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down. Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight? Can't you see, I love you?
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Treat me nice, treat me good
Treat me like you really should
'Cause I'm not made of wood
And I don't have a wooden heart
Muss I denn, muss I denn
Zum stadt heraus Stadt heraus
Und du, mein schatz, bleibst hier?
Muss I denn, muss I denn Zum stadt heraus Stadt heraus
Und du, mein schatz, bleibst hier?
There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Sei mir gut, sei mir gut
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
Wie du wirklich sollst
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true. Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, lets forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me
You know what I want you to say.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart. Lets walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of. Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

It swings, it jives

She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat I gotta be cool, relax

And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready

Just a hunk, a hunk of burnin' love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burnin' love When you walk through a storm hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run Little sister dont you do what your big sister does
Well, I dated your big sister
And took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out of the door Ev'ry time I see your sister
Well she's got somebody new
She's mean and she's evil
Like that old Boll Weevil
Guess I'll try my luck with you Well, I used to pull your pigtails
And pinch your turned-up nose
But you been a growin'
And baby, it's been showin'
From your head down to your toes Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done I just can't help believin'
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes I just can't help believin'
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the
Rhythm of her sighs This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day Oh, I just can't help believin'
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove I just can't help believin'
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining
Honey sweet with love This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day More than just a day Oh, I just can't help believin'
Oh, I just can't help believin'
Oh, I just can't help believin'
Oh, I just can't help believin' For more than just a day Oh, I just can't help believin'
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove I just can't help believin'
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining
Honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
Oh, I just can't help believin'
Oh, I just can't help believin'
Oh, I just can't help believin'
Oh, I just can't help believin' I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same, dear, if you're not here with me And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas Just pretend, I'm holding you
And whispering things soft and low
And think of me, how it's gonna be,
Just pretend I didn't go
When I walked away, I heard you say
If you need me, you know what to do
If knew it then, I'd be back again
Just pretend I'm right there with you And I'll come flying to you, again
All the crying is through
Oh, I will hold you and love you again
But until then, well just pretend Oh, it's funny but I can't recall the things
We said or why you cry
But now I know it was wrong to go
I belong here by your side And I'll come flying to you, again
All my crying is true
Oh, I will hold you and love you again
But until then, well just pretend I will hold you and love you again
But until then, well just pretend There's a sweet sweet spirit in this place
And I know that it's the spirit of the Lord There are sweet expressions on each face
And I know that it's the presence of the Lord Sweet Holy Spirit
Sweet heavenly dove
Stay right here with us
Filling us with your love
And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise (hearts in praise)
Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived
When we shall leave this place Babe, you're getting closer
The lights are goin' dim
The sound of your breathin'
Has made the mood I'm in All of my resistance
Is lying on the floor
Taking me to places
I've never been before Ooh, and I can feel it

I'm proud to say that she's my
Buttercup

Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,

Thy power throughout the universe displayed: Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art! When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze: Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art! And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin: Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art! When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art! Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art! You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake- sugar,
But you'll never shake me

Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why
Can't my dream come true oh why? There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear, if I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why Won't that sun appear?
We're lost in a cloud, with too much of rain
We're trapped in a world, that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man, has the strength to dream He can redeem his soul and fly
(Deep in heart)
Deep in my heart there's a tremblin' question
Still I am sure that the answer, answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle
And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, please let my dream
Come true right now, let it come true right now oh yeah Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me (Wont you love me?)

Then the hand of Jesus touched me
He touched me
and now I am no longer the same.
For He touched me
oh, He touched me

and now all the wonderful joy that floods my soul.
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole.
Oh since I met this Blessed Savior
and since He cleansed and made me whole,

and shout it while eternity rolls.
Oh, He touched me,

And all the joy that floods my soul.
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole. I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The song of God discloses And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old things they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In Dixieland, I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
Cause Dixieland, that's where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on So hush little baby
Don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
But all my trials, Lord will soon be over Well a hard headed woman,
a soft hearted man
been the cause of trouble
ever since the world began.
Oh yeah, ever since the world began

a thorn in the side of man. Now Adam told to Eve,
"Listen here to me,

messin' round that apple tree."
Oh yeah, ever since the world began

a thorn in the side of man. Oh yeah, ever since the world began

loud and clear,
"Keep your cotton pickin' fingers
out my curly hair."

who was doin' swell
till he started playing
with that evil Jezebel.
Oh yeah, ever since the world began

a head like a rock.
If she ever went away
I'd cry around the clock.
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
a hard headed woman been
a thorn in the side of man,
a hard headed woman been
a thorn in the side of man. You're sleeping son, I know
But, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain
Before it gets too late For your mother and me
Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay just the same Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay her and watch you grow Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy Yeah, because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on Yeah, down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize I was only dreamin' There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak again
I'll touch the green, green grass of home Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old tree
As I lay me in the green, green grass of home Return to sender, Return to sender
I gave a letter to the postman
he put it his sack.
bright and early next morning
he brought my letter back. She wrote upon it:
Return to sender, address unknown.
No such number, no such zone.
We had a quarrel, a lover's spat
I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back. So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D.
bright and early next morning
it came right back to me. She wrote upon it:
Return to sender, address unknown.
No such person, no such zone.
This time I'm gonna take it myself
and put it right in her hand.
And if it comes back the very next day
then I'll understand the writing on it Return to sender, address unknown.
No such number, no such zone.

I' gonna tell you a little story,
so you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that
grows out in the woods and the fields,
and it looks something like a turnip green.
Everybody calls it Polk salad. Now that's Polk salad.
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
she'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it...
Carry it home and cook it for supper,
'cause that's about all they had to eat,
But they did all right. Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang
What a mean, vicious woman Everyday before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack Polk salad Annie
'Gators got you granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause the mama was working on the chain-gang
Whoo, how wretched, dispiteful,
straight-razor totin' woman,
Lord have mercy. Sock a little Polk salad to him
Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah But daddy was a lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck patch For once Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
You sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah Chic a bon, chic a bon,
chic a bon bon bon bon
Chic a bon, chic a bon,

Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Chinc, chinc, chinc,
chin, ling, ling ling You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord (one accord)
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind
Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray (knees and pray)
Your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way (and you'll surely find the way) Hold me close, hold me tight
Make me thrill with delight
Let me know where I stand
From the start I want you, I need you
I love you with all my heart Ev'ry time that you're near
All my cares disappear
Darling, you're all that
I'm livin' for I want you, I need you
I love you more and more I thought, I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that
I will go on loving you eternally Won't you please be my own?
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die ev'ry time
We're apart I want you, I need you
I love you with all my heart Well, I thought, I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that
I will go on loving you eternally Won't you please be my own?
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die ev'ry time
We're apart I want you, I need you
I love you with all my heart Have I told you lately that I love you?
Could I tell you once again somehow?
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?
Well darling I'm telling you now Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream I dream is you somehow?
Have I told you why the nights are long
When you're not with me?
Well darling I'm telling you now My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
And have I told you lately that I love you
Well darling I'm telling you now My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
And have I told you lately that I love you
Well darling I'm telling you now Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darlin', then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart One night with you
Is what I? m now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true Just call my name
And I? ll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide Always lived very quiet life
I ain? t never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Is being too lonely, too long One night with you
Is what I? m now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true Always lived very quiet life
I ain? t never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Is being too lonely, too long
One night with you
Is what I? m now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true Seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home So I'm walking in the rain, thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky back road
I've loved you much too long, my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes)
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain Showed your photograph to some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said, "Yes, she's been here"
But their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday?
No, wait, the day before Finally got a ride with a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?"
As we drove on through the rain, as he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes)
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain Well, it's hard to be a gambler
Bettin' on the number
That changes ev'ry time Well, you think you're gonna win
Think she's givin' in
A stranger's all you find Yeah, it's hard to figure out
What she's all about
But she's woman through and through She's a complicated lady
So color my baby moody blue Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song
But I never do Oh, Moody blue
Tell me who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day and it's hard to say
Which one is you Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday
Into another day again Her personality unwinds
Just like a ball of twine
On a spool that never ends Just when I think I know her well
Her emotions reveal
She's not the person that I though I knew She's a complicated lady
So color my baby moody blue Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song
But I never do Oh, Moody blue
Tell me who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day and it's hard to say
Which one is you I'm afraid of my Moody blue Oh, Moody blue
Tell me who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day and it's hard to say
Which one is you Yeah, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song
But I never do Let me tell you 'bout Moody blue Ev'ry time you kiss me
I'm still not certain that you love me
Ev'ry time you hold me
I'm still not certain that you care Though you keep on saying
You really, really, really love me
Do you speak the same words
To someone else when I'm not there? Suspicion, torments my heart
Suspicion, keeps us apart
Suspicion, why torture me? Ev'ry time you call me
And tell me we should meet tomorrow
I can't help but think that
You're meeting someone else tonight Why should our romance just
Keep on causing me such sorrow?
Why am I so doubtful
Whenever you're out of sight? Suspicion, torments my heart
Suspicion, keeps us apart
Suspicion, why torture me? Darling, if you love me
I beg you wait a little longer
Wait until I drive all
These foolish fears out of my mind How I hope and pray that
Our love will keep on growing stronger
Maybe I'm suspicious
'Cause true love is so hard to find Suspicion, torments my heart
Suspicion, keeps us apart
Suspicion, why torture me? And I love you so,
The people ask me how,
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand And yes I know how lonely life can be
Shadows follow me
The night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do The book of life is brief
Once the page is read
All but love is dead
This is my belief Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine Quiet thoughts come floating down and settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves around my feet
I touched them and they burst apart with sweet memories
Sweet memories Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories, sweet memories, memories When it comes twistin' I just got to keep insistin'
Oh baby ... you sure do swing When it comes twistin' I just got to keep insistin'
Oh daddy hey, you are the king Baby you got me beat up and down inside out and across

The day I found you

Stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me
Don't take
This heaven from one
If you must
Cling to someone
Now and forever

Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love

(Look like an angel)
Walk like an Angel
(Walk like an angel) Talk like an Angel
But I got wise You're the Devil in disguise
Oh yes you are, Devil in disguise
You fooled me with your kisses
You cheated and you schemed Heaven knows how you lied to me
You're not the way you seemed
You look like an Angel
(Look like an angel) Walk like an Angel
(Walk like an angel) Talk like an Angel
But I got wise
You're the Devil in disguise
Oh yes you are, Devil in disguise I thought that I was in Heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me, I didn't see
The Devil in your eyes You look like an Angel
(Look like an angel) Walk like an Angel
(Walk like an angel)
Talk like an Angel
But I got wise
You're the Devil in disguise
Oh yes you are, Devil in disguise
You're the Devil in disguise
Oh yes you are, Devil in disguise
Oh yes you are, Devil in disguise
Oh yes you are, Devil in disguise She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me, she loves me
The lady loves me and it shows
In spite of the way she turns up her nose
I'm her ideal, her hearts desire
Under that ice she's burning like fire
She'd like to cuddle up to me
She's playing hard to get
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet The gentleman has savoir-faire
As much as an elephant or a bear
I'd like to take him for a spin
Back to the zoo to visit his kin
He's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette
The lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet The lady's got a crush on me
The gentleman's crazy obviously
The lady's dying to be kissed
The gentleman needs a psychiatrist
I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
Or play Russian roulette
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet She's falling fast she's on the skids
Both of his heads are flipping their lids
Tonight she'll hold me in her arms
I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs
Will someone tell this Romeo
I'm not his Juliet
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet She wants me
Like poison ivy
Needs me
Like a hole in the head
Everyone can see she's got it bad
He's mad!
The gentleman is an egotist
I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist
He's one man I could learn to hate
How's about having dinner at eight
I'd rather dine with Frankenstein
In a moonlight tete-a-tete
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet Oh yes she loves me
Dig that shrinking violet
Oh she really loves me
Here's one gal you'll never get
She lo- lo- loves me
Would you like to make a bet
I said the lady loves me
The gentleman's all wet Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay When the memories that linger into my heart
Memories that make my heart go cold
However some day they gonna live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay When the memories that linger in my heart
Memories they gonna make my heart grow cold
Well, you know some day they gonna live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out
And ringing in my ears
Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's true, but somehow
It just don't seem right
'Cause ev'ry time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight
Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Oh, daddy, please don't cry Her hair is soft and her eyes are also blue
She's all the things a girl should be but she's not you
She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's everything a man could want but she's not you And when we're dancing it almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from whispering your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you And when we're dancing it almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from whispering your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you
