Sitting with you in a dark room
Warm by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope i say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life? There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, i'll be fine
If my waistline goes, i'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter; it'd be Rose
Son; it'd be [?] There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline goes, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're hear by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline goes, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life He said I was in my early forties, with a lot of life before me
And one moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, looking at the x-rays
Talking bout' the options and talking bout' sweet times.
I asked him when it sank in, that this might really be the real end
How's it hit 'cha when you get that kind of news?
Man what did ya do?
He said I went skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denyin'
And he said some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin' He said I was finally the husband, that most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend, a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin, wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book, and I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then I went skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Shu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denyin'
And he said some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin' Like tomorrow was the end
And ya got eternity to think about what to do with it
What should you do with it
What can I do with it
What would I do with it Skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And man I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flyin'
And he said some day I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin' You know there's a light that glows by the front door

Help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind Got to hold on easy as I let you go,
gonna tell you how much I love,
though you think you already know,
I remeber I thought you looked like an angel,
wrapped in pink so soft and warm,
you had me wrapped around your finger,
since the day you were born. You beautiful baby from the outside in,
Chase your dreams but always know the road
that'll lead you home again,
Go on, take on this whole world,
But to me you know you'll always be,
My Little Girl When you were in trouble that crooked little smile,
could melt my heart of stone,
Now look at you, I've turned around,
and you've almost grown,
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper "I Love You!",
in the moonlight at your door,
As I walk away, I hear you say,
"Daddy Love You More!". You're beautiful baby from the outside in.
Chase your dreams but always know the road,
that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world.
But to me you know you'll always be,
my little girl. Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand.
But I won't say "yes" to him unless I know, he's the half
that makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man.
I know he'll say that he's in love.
But between you and me. He won't be good enough! You're beautiful baby from the outside in.
Chase your dreams but always know the road
that'll lead you home again.
Go on, take on this whole world.
But to me you know you'll always be,
my little girl! I never had no one
That I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah You stand by me
And you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense

Girl, wherever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only god knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love I don't ever wanna wake up
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another voice callin' me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No, I don't ever wanna know, oh oh
No other shotgun rider, beside me, singin' to the radio, whoa, oh Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep, I'll let you
Dream, life aint nothin' but a dream, don't wanna be
Cruisin' through this dream without you No other shotgun rider, oh oh Singin' to the radio, oh oh You're my shotgun rider There's two things I know for sure
She was sent here from heaven and she's Daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
Oh, but most of all for... Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
"Walk beside the pony Daddy, it's my first ride
I know the cake looks funny Daddy but I sure tried"
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night Sweet sixteen today
And she's lookin' like her mamma a little more every day
One part woman, the other part girl
To perfume and make-up, from ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world
But I remember... Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
You know how much I love you Daddy
But if you don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night Oh the precious times
Oh, like the wind the years go by
Precious butterfly
Spread your wings and fly She'll change her name today
and she'll make a promise and I'll give her away
Standing in the bride room just staring at her
She asked me what I'm thinking and I said "I'm not sure,
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl"
And she leaned over...and gave me... Butterfly kisses with her mamma there
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
"Walk me down the aisle Daddy, it's just about time
Does my wedding gown look pretty Daddy? Daddy don't cry"
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses I couldn't ask God for more
Man, this is what love is
I know I've gotta let her go, but I'll always remember
Every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses at night Dancin' in the dark
Middle of the night
Takin' your heart
And holdin' it tight Emotional touch
Touchin' my skin
And askin' you to do
What you've been doin' all over again Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go It's your love
It just does somethin' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
It's your love Better than I was
More than I am
And all of this happened
By takin' your hand And who I am now
Is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together
I'm stronger than ever
I'm happy and free Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in, no
And if you asked me why I changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name It's your love

 I wanna drink that shot of whiskey
I wanna smoke that cigarette
I wanna smell that sweet addiction on my breath
I wanna ride 'cross West Virginia
In the back seat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that So I need you, like a needle needs a vein
Like my uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
And I need you, like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the Father and the Son need the Holy Ghost
I need you I wanna get lost in some corner booth, Cantina, Mexico
I wanna dance to the static of an AM radio
I wanna wrap the moon around us, lay beside you skin on skin
Make love 'til the sun comes up, 'til the sun goes down again 'Cause I need you, like a needle needs a vein
Like my uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you, like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the Father and the Son need the Holy Ghost
I need you, oh I need you I wanna drink that shot of whiskey
I wanna smoke that cigarette
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you, oh I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you too It was Labor Day weekend, I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and a some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset
And that's a day I'll never forget I had a BBQ stain on my white T-shirt
She was killing me in that mini-skirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that Well, it was five years later on a south bound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past comin' from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said, "I bet you don't remember me"
And I said, "Only every other memory" I had a BBQ stain on my white T-shirt
You were killing me in that mini-skirt
Skipping rocks on the river railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget somethin' like that Like an old photograph, time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love never fades away I had a BBQ stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that mini-skirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget
I said a heart don't forget, somethin' like that
Oh no, not somethin' like that Just When I Needed You Most (Live) - Tim McGraw
Woke up this morning and I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing door
I didn't stand in your way
I miss you more than I missed you before
And where I'll find comfort God knows
Cause you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most
Most every morning I stare out the window
And I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
I miss you more than I missed you before
And where I'll find comfort God knows
Cause you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most
Woke up this morning and I stared out the window
And I struggled for somethin to say
You left in the rain without sayin a word
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more than I missed you before
And where I'll find comfort God knows
Cause you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed Runnin' round in this new truck, bank let's me borrow from month to month
Runnin' out of credit and find a little cash on the radio
Standin' still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin' NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know 'Cause where I come from only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy Meanwhile back at Mama's, the porch light's on, come in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beers in the fridge, red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge,
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes, whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss, in a world gone crazy as this Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here --- 'Cause meanwhile back at Mama's, the porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beers in the fridge, red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes, whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss, in a world gone crazy as this Oh, I miss yeah a little dirt on the road I miss corn growin' in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town roots, walkin' around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof, it's time we head on back --- 'Cause meanwhile back at Mama's the for sale sign's goin' up
And I'm gonna dump this truck and the little I got on a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge, goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin' on the ridge, baby, tell me what you think about this --- Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah, me and you back at Mama's Tim McGraw
"Not a moment too soon" I was standing at the end of my rainbow
with nowhere to go and no pot of gold in sight
All my wishes were just way too much to hope for,
But when I saw you, I knew I'd seen the light And not a moment too soon, Without a minute to spare
You touched my heart, when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour
with my world filled with blues
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon I used to think that love would never find me
And the one who cares was lost somewhere in time
But when you found me I knew I'd found forever,
You rescued me just before I crossed the line And not a moment too soon, Without a minute to spare
You touched my heart, when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour
with my world filled with blues
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
Oh not a moment too soon, yeah Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishing
when he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go
but someday you'll change your mind And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Timmy Thompson
take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please, don't take the girl Same old boy, same sweet girl
ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
grabbed her by the arm
Said if you do what I tell you to there
won't be any harm And Johnny said
Take my money, take my wallet
take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please, don't take the girl Same old boy, same sweet girl
five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine
but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fading fast and, Johnny hit his knees And there he prayed
Take the very, breath you gave me
take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please, don't take the girl
Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old It's a 3 day drive - if she drives all night
Say's she's leavin' at the crack of dawn
Well she might still be lyin' here with me
But in her heart she's already gone
Already packed up, the altima's gassed up
She's done put the map up there on the dash
I'm all tore up just tryin' to man up
Dammin' these tears up but can't hold 'em back (Cuz) she's in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain't no holly woods
And these hills ain't Beverly
Ain't no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She's in love with California
And breakin' my heart Got a waitress job waitin' in an ihop
Throw a rock and hit universal city
Got a glamour shot in her hip pocket
Hopin' somebody'll think she's pretty
By this time tomorrow she'll hit Colorado
I'll be drownin' my sorrow in a bottle of beam
Before she hits flagstaff maybe she'll backtrack
But I wouldn't bet that if I was me (Cuz) she's in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain't no holly woods
And these hills ain't Beverly
Ain't no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She's in love with California
And breakin' my heart She was all mine
But now it's go time She's in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain't no holly woods
And these hills ain't Beverly
There ain't no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She's in love with California
And breakin' my heart

She's got me sayin' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin'", and "Dear"
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it My mamma and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'till that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas, and opening up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweeping my floor
I'm crossing my fingers, and counting every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it I gotta wash my truck
And dress up
Pick her up to watch TV
When she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it Come on, baby
You know what I like Yeah, I like that
Mmm, mmm, mmm Hey! Don't forget to turn out the lights! I packed it all on a whim
threw an old Hank cassete tape in
dad's '84 rusty ford
he swore we'd never make it
I quit my job, let my momma down
broke an angel's heart on the way out
of town
pulled my roots from the ground for
the hum of wheels on the blacktop
the strum of strings on a flat top
it's a neon fever for a small town dreamer
tells you everything you have that's worth losin'
damn country music
you might get lost in the lights
the things that keep you up all night
whiskey straight 3 a.m.
chasin' songs in your head
it's the sweetest highs, the lowest lows
needin' yes and hearin' no
just another so-so
believe me i know
it's the hum of wheels on the blacktop
the strum of strings on a flat top
it'll take you, break you
damn sure make you
do things you never thought you'd be doing
damn country music
when the money, the fame
the lights on your name
all fade away
well you'll still be a slave to
the hum of wheels on the blacktop
the strum of strings on a flat top
it's a neon fever for a small town dreamer
tells you everything you have that's worth losing
damn country music
damn country music Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, baby The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
Trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you baby, oh baby The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do.
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do. I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do. I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby

The highway don't care
But I do, I do I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby

The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby

The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you
I can't live without you, baby You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from being made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no Just like when you were leaving Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
Cause leavin didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
But I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aww honey I won't lie I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I'm cleanin up my act, little by little
I'm getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain't as good as I'm gonna get
But I'm better than I used to be I've pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I've got a few old habits left
There's one or two I might need you to help me get
Standin in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you'll see
There's a diamond under all this dust I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I'm cleanin up my act, little by little
I'm getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain't as good as I'm gonna get
But I'm better than I used to be I ain't no angel
I still got a still few more dances with the devil
But I'm cleanin up my act, little by little
I'm getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain't as good as I'm gonna get
But I'm better than I used to be Baby, I think we both know
It's gone wrong, wrong, wrong
And I know you don't think we can carry it on
Baby, I think we both know
It's gone bad, bad, bad
Think of all the good times we had Driving to your house
'Member when we first met
Dancing on a friday night
Under the moonlight
Talking 'til the night was gone
In the back of my truck with the radio on Then that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
When that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
That old country song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Baby, I think we both know
It's alright, alright
But how could I forget what you did that night
Baby, you told me you loved me in Tennessee
Where we were gonna live
But now you've done a few things that I can't forgive Driving to her house
Tellin' her you love her
Lying on a friday night
Ring in your pocket
Lying to me all along
In the back of your truck with the radio on Then that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
I know we went wrong but we belong
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
That old country song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Then that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
I know we went wrong but we belong
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
That old country song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah When all our tears have reached the sea Part of you will live in me Way down deep inside my heart The days keep coming without fail A new wind is gonna find yourself That's where your journey starts
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me Just like the waves down by the shore Your gonna keep on coming back for more 'Cause we don't ever wanna stop Out in this brave new world you seek O'er the valleys and the peaks And I can see you on the top
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me Remember me when you're out walkin' When snow falls high outside your door Late at night when you're not sleepin' And moonlight falls across your floor When I can't hurt you anymore
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me Please remember me Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess.
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips. She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rockin' on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said lets go and get it on
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don't know what it meant but it felt good on my lips. Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you Everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips She ordered us a drink
It was a purple kind of pink
She said it's got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mello yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mello for me to be seen with
But I took a sip
Yeah it felt good on my lips Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you Everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips When the lights came on and they hollered last call
I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss
In a little corner booth I don't like no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long and wet
A goodnight goodbye kiss
And It felt good on my lips Whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
Whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair,
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Comin' from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
You were killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget
I said a heart don't forget something like that
Oh, not something like that I been caught sideways out here on the crossroads
Tryin' to buy back the pieces I lost of my soul
It's hard when the devil won't get off your back
It's like carryin' around the past in a hundred pound sack Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'
I'm gonna hold my head up high
Gonna leave it all behind
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away, yeah wash it all away
I'm gonna let it go, Oh oh, Oh yeah
I'm gonna let it go, oh oh, Oh yeah Skeletons and ghosts are hidin' in the shadows
Threatening me with all the things that they know
Choices and mistakes they all know my name
I'm through holdin' in and holdin' on to all that pain Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'
I'm gonna hold my head up high
Got no more tears to cry
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away, yeah wash it all away
I'm gonna let it go, Oh oh, Oh yeah!
I'm gonna let it go, Oh oh, Oh yeah! I know, I know, I know, I know I been forgiven
I know, I know, I know, I'm gonna start livin' Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'
I'm gonna hold my head up high
I'm Gonna leave it all behind
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away, yeah wash it all away
I'm gonna let it go, Oh oh, Oh yeah!
I'm gonna let it go, Oh oh, Oh yeah!
I'm gonna let it go, Oh oh, Oh yeah!
Oh oh, Oh yeah! I'm a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar
I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And that's how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be I got friends that say I live a little like cool hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But hey on Sunday morning I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals fresh cut hay fields and hometowns I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be Here we are
What is left of a husband and a wife
With four good kids
Who have a way of getting on with their lives
And i'm not old but i'm gettin' a whole lot older everyday
It's too late to keep from goin' crazy
I've got to get away chorus:
The reasons that i can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
And i understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one
Who feels like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time Our boys are strong now
The spittin' image of you when you were young
I hope someday they can see past what you have become
And i remember everytime I said I'd never leave
But what i can't live with is memories of the way you used to be The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
And I understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels
Like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time Twenty years
Have came and went since I walked out of your door
I never quite made it back to the one I was before
And God it hurts me
To think of you for the light in your eyes was gone
And sometimes I don't know why
This old world can't leave well enough alone The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
And I understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels
Like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time Six lanes, tail lights
Red ants marching into the night
Disappear to the left and right again
Another supper from a sack
A 99-cent heart attack
I've got a pounding head and an achin back
And the camels buried in the big straw stack I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the West
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows Well I'm from a map dot
A stop sign on a black top
Caught the first bus I could hop from there
But all of this glitter is getting dark
There's concrete growin in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
There's bars on the corners and bars on my heart I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Oh, where the green grass grows Dancin' where the stars go blue
Dancin' where the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown Dancin' out on 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' little marionette
Are you happy now? Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue Laughing with your pretty mouth
Laughing with your broken eyes
Laughing with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
The stars go blue, stars go blue Now I ain't sayin' them LA ladies don't know what they're doin'
And I been in love with New York City a time or two
I had some Seattle coffee, some Chicago wind
Some Kansas sweet fields I'd love to see again
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow
And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl (Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long)
A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her thighs in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes jiggers in her coke, takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans Memphis blue and Daytona sunny Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl
(Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long)
If you've ever seen savannah heat up when the stars come out
Well then fellows come on, you know what I'm talkin' about
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl
(Southern girl rock my world
Put on a country song
Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden girls
We'll dance all night long
Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden girls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long) Hank Williams sang it, Number 3 drove it
Chuck Berry twanged it, Will Faulkner wrote it
Aretha Franklin sold it, Dolly Parton graced it
Rosa Parks rode it, Scarlett O. chased it Smooth as the hickory wind
That blows from Memphis down to Apalachicola
It's, "Hi y'all, did ya eat well?
Come on in, I'm sure glad to know ya" Don't let this old gold cross
And this Allman Brothers t-shirt throw ya
It's cicadas making noise
With the Southern voice Hank Aaron smacked it, Michael Jordan dunked it
Pocahontas tracked it, Jack Daniels drunk it
Tom Petty rocked it, Dr. King paved it
Bear Bryant won it, Billy Graham saved it Smooth as the hickory wind
That blows from Memphis down to Apalachicola
It's, 'Hi y'all, did ya eat well?
Come on in, I'm sure glad to know ya" Don't let this old gold cross
And this Crimson Tide t-shirt throw ya
It's cicadas making noise
With the Southern voice Jesus is my friend, America is my home
Sweet iced tea and Jerry Lee
Daytona Beach, that's what gets to me
I can feel it in my bones Smooth as the hickory wind
That blows from Memphis down to Apalachicola
It's, 'Hi y'all, did ya eat well?
Come on in, I'm sure glad to know ya" Don't let this old gold cross
And this Charlie Daniels t-shirt throw ya
We're just boys making noise
With the Southern voice, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Southern voice
I got a Southern voice
Southern voice She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, baby why are you
Trembling like you are So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain She's the sun set shadows
She's like rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain When I was nineteen I threw my stuff in the car
Headed up to the rockies, got a job at this bar
Sellin' beer to the locals, just barely gettin' by
On the tips from the rich kids there on daddy's dime
But when I saw her walk in one night
I knew that I'd be alright in Chorus:
Telluride
The snow fallin' down
I was waking up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride We spent that whole winter tangled up by the fire
Castin' shadows on the cabin wall drownin' in desire
Confessin' all our secrets, laughin' out loud
So high up on that mountain, I thought we'd never come down
It was a dream we were livin' in
I was the happiest I'd ever been in ... Chorus: Telluride
The snow fallin down
Waking up with her in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride It ended just like a movie scene
And I had to play the part
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave
And me with a frozen heart in ... Chorus: Telluride
The snow fallin' down
Standin' there alone in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget that day she said goodbye in ... Repeat Chorus She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklin's, she wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money, it's all how you treat her
She just wanna a friend to be there when she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with the lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your mama
Respect the hell out of her
Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl She don't give a damn 'bout you're pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just wanna feel that you're real, that she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne, that she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with the lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your mama
Respect the hell out of her
Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl That's how you speak to, speak to her
That's how you speak to, speak to her Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with the lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your mama
Respect the hell out of her
Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl That's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl I was twenty and she was eighteen
we were just about as wild as we were green
in the ways of the world
she'd pick me up in that red ragtop
we were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
on a summer night
running all the red lights
we'd park way out in a clearing in a grove
and the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove
we were cooking wiht gas
knew it had to last
(chorus)
in the back of that red ragtop
she said please don't stop
Well the very first time her mother met me
her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be
for two weeks
i was out of job and she was in school
and life was fast and the world was cruel
we were young and wild
we decided not to have the child
so we did what we did and we tried to forget
and we swore up and down there would be no regrets
in the morning light
but on the way home that night
(chorus)
from the back of that red ragtop
she said please don't stop loving me
We took one more trip around the sun
but it was all make believe in the end
and no i can't say where she is today
i can't remember who i was back then
Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins
and there's no such thing as what might have been
that's a waste of time
drive you out of your mind
i was stopped at a red light just yesterday
beside a young girl in a cabriolet
and her eyes were green
and i was in an old scene
(chorus)
i was back in that red ragtop
on the day she stopped loving me
i was back in that red ragtop
on the day she stopped loving me Girl you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Cept to do the best I can
I'll be damned
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man I may be a real bad boy
Oh but baby I'm a real good man
Yes I am My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I wouldn't trade them for gold
Cause they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They're woven in the stories I have told
And tell again My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There's always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets thin, my old friend Don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why My old friend, this song's for you
Cause a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Cause the love and the laughter
Will live on long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We'll meet again, my old friend Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye My old friend, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye She's getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick
She be shaking, riding to them cut-offs baby, oh yeah
You're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
Here she comes now looking so fine
You've been waiting for this night for such a long, long time She slides in and you rode down main street
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now you're half way to heaven
She picks a song you turn it up to eleven
You say "Do you wanna?" and she says "Hell yeah!"
So you hit the party all your buddies are jealous
Someday you'll be looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights Crowded back yard, everybody's laughing
Kinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened
Coming up on midnight, 'bout time going
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song
You slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers baby let's go And then she slides in and gives you the green light
You hold off till you turn on the headlights
Someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah one of those nights Full moon through a crack in the windshield
You hold her close and you'll never forget how her heart beat feels
No you never will
'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah one of those nights
One of those nights
Yeah one of those nights
One of those nights, oh
One of those nights
This is gonna be
This is gonna be
One of those nights There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
And I'll be over it by noon
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you Come tomorrow I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem yeah they'll always sell me more
But you're forgiveness is something I can't buy
Ain't a thing that I can do
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you (Chorus)
One's the devil and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps hide me from my pain
And one's a long hard bitter truth
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink 'cause I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
If I don't break down and bring it on myself it'll hit right out of the blue
That's the difference between the whiskey and you (Chorus) Yeah that's the difference between the whiskey and you I think I'll take a moment to celebrate my age
The ending of an era, and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord, have mercy on my next thirty years In my next thirty years
I'm gonna have some fun
Trying to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years In my next thirty years
I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doing here, in my next thirty years Oh my next thirty years
I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers, huh
Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years My next thirty years
Will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here
In my next thirty years In my next thirty years
oh yha
ohhhhh
Here we go boys Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, baby The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
Trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you baby, oh baby The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do.
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do. I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do. I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby

I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you
I can't live without you, baby Ain't it just like a tear
To go and blur out everything
Ain't just like glass
To fall and break so easily
Ain't it just like love
To leave a mark on the skin and underneath
Yeah, when the pain goes and shadows everything Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
When it hurts to much to see
Keep your eyes on me Ain't it the sinner
Who gets all the grace sometimes
Ain't it the saint
Who picks up the pieces left behind
Yeah, and it's human to hurt the one
You hurt the one you love the most
And you can't find the sun Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me You swear you're all alone sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
And you can't find your way home sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When you can't find your way home

That old rusted up pick-up truck
In no time at all, I'd have it
Lookin' like brand new, then you Flipped the switch on my dumaflachi
Played my piano like Liberace
I let down my guard
And my heart was good as gone, so long Yeah, you cranked my tractor, you flicked my bic
Woman, you trip the trigger on my thing-a-majig
Can't explain how you've done it
But, honey, you turn me on You look at all the takin', I done all the givin'
I threw up my hands, said, "The heck with it"
I shut down my heart, locked it up and pulled the fuse
Before it blew All my emotions were disconnected
No sign of a spark could be detected
I had nobody so I had nothing to lose
Then you Flipped the switch on my dumaflachi
Played my piano like Liberace
I let down my guard
And my heart was good as gone, so long Yeah, you cranked my tractor, you flicked my bic
Woman, you trip the trigger on my thing-a-majig
Can't explain how you've done it
But, honey, you turn me on Yeah, you crank my tractor, you flick my bic
Woman you trip the trigger on my thing-a-majig
Can't explain how you've done it
But, honey, you turn me on I can't handle that, baby
You better slow down If you're reading this
My Mommas sittin there
Looks like I only got a one way ticket over here
Sure wish I
Could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home
If you're reading this Half way around the would
I won't be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stands up for the innocent and the weak
I'm laying down my gun I'm hanging up boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes
So lay me down In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed that it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home
If you're reading this There's going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find some one else
And that's ok
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my Momma always prayed that it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home Used to chase that boy home from school
Called him freckled-face, red-headed fool
He was different... he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
And one day he ran away from home, you see
And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say "One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might've been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
Maybe even cry a little but
One of these days you're gonna love me" Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should've seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17, you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away
And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering "One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might've been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little but
One of these days you're gonna love me" Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singin'
The moment that I learn One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days, I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
Then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little but
One of these days I'm gonna love me Every where I go,
they're starin' at her,
every man I know.
He wants to have her
I guess I outta be a jealous man. I look the other way
they're hittin' on her every night and day
they telephone her
they try and get to her
but I know they can't 'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
she never lets it go that far
when they start talkin'
she starts walkin'
right back to my arms
she can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart. She walks into the room
and everybody watches every move
hopin' she don't love me
I know it by the way
they hang around.
but they don't realize
there's more to her than what meets eye
that's why i'm certain
that no matter what they do
to reach her now 'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
she never lets it go that far
when they start talkin'
she starts walkin'
right back to my arms
she can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart. she never lets it go to her heart (repeat chorus until fades) Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Don't happen much anymore We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played them all
Country, soul and rock-and-roll
What happened to those times? I'm readin' Street Slang For Dummies
Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when Give me a flat top for strumming
I want the whole world to be humming
Just keep it coming
The way it was back then Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when Diamond rings and old barstools
One's for queens and one's for fools
One's the future and one's the past
One's forever and one won't last It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools The wrongs and rights, the highs and lows
The "I love you's," the "I told you so's"
Past few miles to wherever's home
Another morning waking up alone It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools We ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
Nothing like watered down whiskey and coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools (steve seskin, tom douglas) I pulled into the shopping center
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face
All mornin' I'd been thinkin' my life's so hard
And they wore everything they own, livin' in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry Keep having this dream about my old man
I'm 10 years old, and he's holding my hand
We're talkin' on the front porch watchin' the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around
So many things I wanna say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry I'm sittin' here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it's up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
I haven't had my story yet. And everything weighin' on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says,
I love you dad I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry Got Lil' Wayne pumpin' on my iPod
Pumpin' on the subs in the back of my crew cab
Redneck rockin' like a rockstar
Sling a lil' mud off the back, we can do that

Truck Yeah! 
 I just walked in and you were gone
To your mama's I suppose
It looks like you won't be back
So I thought you ought to know I found that note you left today
It only took you half the page
I'm gonna grab my old guitar
Take a pencil from the jar, fill in the empty space I'm gon' tell you how I feel
Straight up, genuine and real
Open a bottle of 90 proof
And write a song for you
Like Kristofferson would do In each line you're gonna hear
It's my fault and I miss you
I know it won't be in time, it may not even rhyme
But all it has to be is true I'm gon' tell you how I feel
Straight up genuine and real
Open a bottle of 90 proof
And write a song for you
Like Kristofferson would do Oh, here it goes, hey Yeah, I'm gon' tell you how I feel
Straight up, genuine and real
Open a bottle of 90 proof
And write a song for you
Like Kristofferson would do I'm gon' drink this bottle of 90 proof
And sing a song for you
Like Kristofferson would do Somewhere familiar, a safe place to land
That feeling you get when you finally come back
I got all these burdens rollin' round in my head
Once I round that corner girl you put 'em all to rest I can feel it, feel it
Got the wheels spinnin', spinnin'
Pullin' me in like I've been here all along
Like I was never gone Oh, Oh, thank God that we don't have to be alone
Closer I get the more that my heart knows
You're like that last turn home
That last turn home And my life, and my mind jumped right off the track
You are the one place I don't need a map
I can almost see it, see it
Baby I need it, need it
Hold me in your arms like you're never gonna let me go
And never let me go Oh, Oh, thank God that we don't have to be alone
Closer I get the more that my heart knows
You're like that last turn home
That last turn home I can feel it, feel it
Got the wheels spinnin', spinnin'
Pullin' me in like I've been here all along
Like I was never gone I can almost see it, see it
Baby I need it, need it
Hold me in your arms like you're never gonna let me go
And never let me go Oh... Oh thank God that we don't have to be alone
Closer I get the more that my heart knows
You're like that last turn home
That last turn home
That last turn home Baby, I go too fast, too far
Let's get it straight now, the way things are
I'm not the white knight in your fantasy
But I could be your wildest dream I might ride with the wind, I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade I get this feelin' that I should be gone
Somethin' keeps tellin' me to take you along
I got a Chevy with a big back seat
Climb on in and take a chance on me I might ride with the wind, I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
My heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade Don't even think about settlin' down
Ain't gonna hang my hat in no hometown I might ride with the wind, I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
My heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade I don't know why I act the way I do
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
I guess that's just the cowboy in me I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fightin' mad
At where this road I'm heading down might lead
I guess that's just the cowboy in me The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me Girl I know there's times you must have thought
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that's just the cowboy in you We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all (track 8 - time 3: 42)
(greg barnhill/kim carnes) She walks over to him and she says do you remember me
I think we might have met somewhere before
Southern carolina is the place that comes to mind
But hey I guess you never really can be sure Oh there's nothing like a true love
To go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore Then an old familiar feeling
Wraps it's arms around the moment
And he says so many times I've tried to call
Well you think you'd spent a lifetime
It's been two years since I've seen you
But it seems like no times gone by at all There was nothing like a real love
To give you back the feel of someone just like before
And right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore Oh and how far we'll travel
For a place to heal our hearts
We watched it unravel
So why's tonight the hardest part Then he says the weather's changin
And it's icing up the highway
So I guess it's time for me to hit the road
So she says goodbye and then before she knows what she is saying
She says I wish that you didn't have to go Oh there's nothing like a true love
To go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore
And right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore After all this time
I still miss you everyday
This same world spins 'round
I guess some things never change Sometimes I go out
But it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby, some things never change When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be Just an old love song
Just the mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again
I guess some things never change, no Maybe someday someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your love's legacy And I'll keep holding on
Hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured
Baby, some things never change Girl, I'm still in love with you
I guess some things never change Ohhhh, ohhhhh I still love you We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you girl
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one, like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyear's and painted rust
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun
Yeah, any way you kiss me, flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl
We could be somewhere or nowhere and still be sitting on top of the world Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one, like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world Top of the world Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one, like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view
Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you

Sitting on top of the world
Cause when you got love, like we got love
Sitting on top of the world Her hat is hanging by the door
The one she bought in mexico
It blocked the wind, it stopped the rain
She'd never leave that one
So she can't be really gone The shoes she bought on christmas eve
She laughed and said they called her name
It's like they're waiting in the hall
For her to slip them on
So she can't be really gone Chorus:
I don't know when she'll come back back
She must intend to come back
And I've seen the error of my ways
Don't waste the tears on me
What more proof do you need
Just look around the room
So much of her remains Her book is lying on the bed
The two of hearts to mark her page
Now who could ever walk away at chapter 21
So she can't be really gone Bridge:
Just look around this room
So much of her remains Her book is lying on the bed
The two of hearts to mark her page
Now who could ever walk away with so much left undone
So she can't be really gone
No she can't be really gone She was like a brand new song on an old guitar
Supernova in a Mason's jar,
Every boy in town wanted to show her around
And as the dirt road Finch cuts the king
Beating along this American dream
Right out out the trunk when she showed up
She had a fire sat in her faraway eyes
And I just knew where to take her that night We got high on top of that bridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton, and the River bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust,
I'm a cigarette burning slow on a summer night
She's city lights She's like a broken heart you can't wait to have,
The shooting star that falls to fast
Try holding on, it's already gone
I searched that radio low and high
Trying find a song that make a memory by
And I did alright, for a small town guy
But even in my old town I knew
I'd never shine this bright as her city lights do We got high on top of that bridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton, and the River bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burning slow on a summer night
She's city lights We got high on top of that bridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton, and the River bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burning slow on a summer night
She's city lights
She's city lights She is my city lights, city lights
She is my city lights, city lights
She is my city lights, city lights
She is my city lights, city lights I'm so glad that I met you, baby
I'm so proud when we walk in the room
I know it's crazy to worry like I do
I get this feelin' that I'm losing you I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
And I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it but it gets me sometimes I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Oh baby, oh darlin' And when I'm with you, I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
That look in your eyes when we make love
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinkin' of I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me Ooh suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me Ooh, suspicions
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Ooh, suspicions
'Cause I love her, 'cause I love her
I love her and she loves me Ooh, suspicions
Ain't nobody gonna take my girl from me
Ooh, suspicions Ooh, suspicions
Ooh, suspicions
Ooh, suspicions I'm gonna clean the house
I'm gonna fix the fence
In my final hours
I'm gonna tie up these loose ends
I won't leave a note
For anyone to find
Tomorrow they'll know
What I've done here tonight The drastic steps I've taken
Are just an act of desperation
I knew no one would miss me so what the hell
I fought alot I drank to much
Hurt everyone I've ever touched
And just how much I hurt you it's hard to tell
This is not some cry for help
It's good by, I wish you well
Because I love you...
I'm gonna kill myself. Now who is that
In my easy chair
Now wait a minute
That's the old me sittin there
And I thank god
The devil in me died
Cause I stand before you now
A man changed and alive The drastic steps I've take
Are just an act of desperation
I knew no one would miss me so what the hell
I fought alot I drank to much
Hurt everyone I've ever touched
And just how much I hurt you it's hard to tell
This is not some cry for help
It's good bye, I wish you well
Because I love you...
I had to kill myself. I'm gonna clean the house
I'm gonna fix that fence
In my final hours
Gonna tie up these loose ends. This is for the nobody
The one in the crowd who's got a
Lost look on his face
This is for the down trotted
The one that the worlds forgotten
Waitin' on a better day
Well I'm in no position to judge on
Heaven knows their just like me
And I'm not alone
And knowing what it's like
To wonder where you're going in this crazy life
And I'm not alone, knowing how it feels
To pray to god and sometimes wonder if he's real
'Cause I got friends that do
Yeah I got friends that do This is for the lost junkie
Who spends all his hard earned money on something that he hates
And this is for the found guilty
Who ain't getting out until he pays his debt to the state
I'm in no position to judge on
Heaven knows it could have been me
And I may not know what it's like
To loose your job 'cause I had this gripped too tight
And I may not know how it feels
To lay your hair down on a prison bed in a world of steel
But I got friends that do
Yeah, I got friends that do This is for yours truly
Just a little verse to remind me
We all got somewhere to turn
And I may not know what its like
To send my only son to save the world and watch him die
And I may not know how it feels
To hang their only cross to prove that love is real
But I got friends that do
Yeah I got friends that do
Yeah I got friends that do
We know we all got friends that do Dear Santa I'm a grown man now,
But I've got a problem here.
If you've been watching then you must know,
I've not been good all year.
I Let her down lost sight of us,
I don't deserve one thing but she does Dear Santa bring her a heart,
The one she's got is broken.
Fill up her stocking with the words,
That I left unspoken.
Now I'm not asking you to bring her love,
'Cause Christmas morning when she wakes up,
Dear Santa that's what she'll get from me. Now I remember Christmas past,
When little was enough.
Now all the presents under all the trees
Couldn't save our love.
We need a miricale like the one on 34th,
To get us back to where we were before. Dear Santa bring her a heart,
The one she's got is broken.
Fill up her stocking with the words,
That I left unspoken.
Now I'm not asking you to bring her love,
'Cause Christmas morning when she wakes up,
Dear Santa that's what she'll get from me. Dear Santa bring her a heart,
The one she's got is broken.
Fill up her stocking with the words,
That I left unspoken.
Now I'm not asking you to bring her love,
'Cause Christmas morning when she wakes up,
Dear Santa that's what she'll get from me. (Vocalizing)
Oh Yeah That's Right Every Friday night there's a steady cloud of dust
That leads back to a field filled with pickup trucks
Got old Hank cranking way up loud
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down There's a big fire burnin' but don't be alarmed
It's just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm Ed's been on the tractor, ain't seen Becky all week
Somebody said they seen 'em heading down to the creek
Farmer Johnson's daughters just pulled up in a jeep
Man he knows how to grow 'em if ya know what I mean Old Dave's gettin' loud but he don't mean no harm
We're just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closing time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm Well, you can come as you are, there ain't no dress code
Just some rural route rules that you need to know
Don't mess with the bull, he can get real mean
Don't forget to shut the gate, stay out of the beans If it starts to rainin' will just head to the barn
We're country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closing time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm Ain't no closing time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm Oh, let's get down, y'all
Stay out of that hay We were born in this little town, growin' up
I was countin' down every single day
'Til we made our get-away But you said you could never see yourself
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home and I was on my own But ever since you said good-bye
I've been out here on the wind
And baby you would be surprised
All the places you have been I've seen you in Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sun set in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day You were down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
And Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere Now a days when I'm passin' through
The conversation always turns to you
And I hear you're doin' fine, livin' out by the county line Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids and the kind of life that you want to lead
Guess you could say the same for me But you and I made our choices all those years ago
Still I know I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road Maybe in Oklahoma, drivin' 'cross the prairie
In Dallas, Texas isn't that where we always said
We would like to try
But never did so maybe that's why You're on every highway just beyond the high-beams
Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you
In Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
And Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sun set in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day
You were down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
And Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere
