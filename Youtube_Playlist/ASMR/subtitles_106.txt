hello everyone it's me he is a female and today I'm going to be coming very close to you and whispering the rest of the video in your ears I wanted to introduce this video this way because in a moment you're going to see a cutscene and I'm going to shut off the automatic focus so that you don't hear that little chirping when the camera focuses when I move so today we are going to do some quotes that I really really like some of them are from shows that I enjoy some of them are from video games and others are from people in real life I'm not going to tell you where they're from if you really like one I want you to google it and look into it I thought that'd be kind of fun fun way to share with you okay so see you in a moment I'm going to get all up in your ears and try to think all your face off I should look worried to you now when I get close my eyes should be in focus success is not final failure is not fatal do continue you might have hurt these won't in some of my other videos I like my things that I love in my videos as easter-egg some of you are really great finding a brave man acknowledges the strength of others it's not in the dog I really really enjoy that quote have someone who is do I think it's pretty great for anyone to remember that your heart and your courage and your determination play a huge part and I was drawn you are and let you feel accomplished courage is found in unlikely places there are so many ways to be brave in this world sometimes bravery involves laying down your life for something bigger than yourself or for someone else sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known or everyone you have ever loved for the sake of something greater but sometimes it doesn't sometimes it is nothing more than printing your teeth through me and the work of every day toward a better life that is the sort of goods are really good to remember you don't need a huge breakfast to happen in order to be brave and sometimes driving through and continuing just keep swimming and story would say sometimes that swimming is brave in itself mind your breath us first bottom line is even a museum coming you're not ready for the big moment but it does so what are we helpless love it no the big moments are going to come you can tell that it's what you do afterwards that comes that's when you find out who you that's for my really great show the hardest thing in the world is still evident walking this road without you to remake forgotten promises my heart may be weak and sometimes it may even given but I've learned that there's a light okay if you feel tired I want you to close your eyes and go to sleep you can always come back to this video and listen to ideas it'll always be here for you but if you're tired I want you to close your eyes laughs and just let me talk you to sleep quiet here and the world isn't very loud here so I want you to take this opportunity and rest I promise I won't put any subliminal messages into fly you're sleeping like Sailor Moon is the greatest show ever don't worry okay I'm massaging here I'm scattered dream that's like a far-our memory I want align the pieces on yours and mine if you live to be 100 I want to be 100 - one day so I never have to live without you that's really really sweet from my beloved childhood show which we're going to now in a second piglet sidled up to poo my boo he was burned yes piglet nothing taking booze in I just wanted to be sure of you there is nothing I would not do for those are really my friends I have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature when someone loves you the way they say your name is different you know that your knee in their mouth promise me you'll always remember you're braver than you believe and stronger than you seem and smarter than you think friendship is unnecessary like a philosophy like art it has no survival value rather it is one of those things would you give value to survival for the next page I'm going to blind you and go from my ear to ear so you won't be able to see me and it might add some anticipatory why did you do all of this for me yes I don't deserve it I have never done anything for you you've been my friend replied Charlotte that in itself is a tremendous thing greed when I was a boy and I would see scary things my mother would say to me look for the helpers you'll always find people who are helping are you doing okay if you could only sense you may never even dream up there is something of yourself the child in me does still and sometimes not so still in the external scheme of things I love you I'm proud of you I forgive you I'm good we don't make mistakes just happy little accident I like animals that's okay though I have more fun than most people sucking at something is the first something life is scary and dark that is why we must find the light I know if and when it comes along people make mistakes it's part of growing up and you never really stop growing again man I don't want your damn limits what the hell am I supposed to do with these with the lemons I'm going to get my engineers strive not but rather value my heart may be weak it's not alone it's grown with each new experience and all with all the friends I've made you become a part of their heart just as they become a part of mind and they think of me now and then they think of me and don't forget me and our hearts won't be one I don't need a woman my friends are my power you can't break a man the way you do it all horse harder you beat the man the dollar he stands the right man in the wrong place can make all the difference our home is where we are fireplace art is not relevant only where we choose to go together how many are there in you whose hopes and dreams to you encompass could you but see the eyes inside Rome the mind in your mind you would see owlet we share the last one is my personal favorite quote it has resonated with me for a long time I learned it in college I was reading a book about genocide and it was said by an anonymous survivor that's what the book said it was it stuck with me because it's something that I tried to live my life by and I always have even though I didn't know my whole life and I think that it's very inspiring and I think it is very brave especially in the context of which it was said I speak my mind because biting my tongue makes my pride bleed this video is shorter than my usual videos and that's because this wasn't really plan I just wanted to give you guys something while I was working on my it's a little different Oh then I know I do I hope you guys and I will see you soon with my different roleplay my advice to you would be probably not to trust the character I'm playing just saying I'm not really sure about her she has her own agenda so until next time Wow hi you by have you ever had a granular examination before I can be a tad lengthy that's because we want to be thorough there's nothing to worry about not going to hurt you your solo dancers okay so let me have a look at you just going to come in take a quick look at your eyes your face let me so we'll look I hurt here
