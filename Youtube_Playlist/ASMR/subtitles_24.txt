Poke in your ear. A little bit. And just getting some q-tips to put in your ears actually. Just in case Because we don't want you to fall in the whole the whole of yourself. Ok. Ok and. I'm going to the other other side, to do the other ear. So just be patient with me. In fact I hope it doesn't tickle too much. As I said before, we don't need too much. Just microscopic amounts. because that's all we need to make the magic with you today. Alright. A little bit more. Ok. So, Just going to wipe it on the walls of my container. Making sure that we really got something. Ok. And now the important part Now I'm going to mix it all together. Then, I'll be using these various mixtures that I've already prepared for you infused with my intentions we'll be putting it all together for you. You know it's been said it is the wounded part of ourselves that becomes attracted to another person. An in a way that's good because the person who you're the most attracted to will probably piss you off. Did I say that? Will probably I mean, there is nothing else to say about that. but only to give you a chance to integrate your experience. To become even more empowered. But for that, you need to have a big dosage of self-love. And I will tell you what is self-love for me. I used to not understand it very well I used to think that self-love is giving myself nice baths and taking care of myself and of course that's a part of it. But then I discovered when I fall in love with myself the most and that's when that's when I take some risks. That's when I, when I become vulnerable. That's when I really expose myself. That's when I do all these things that are so uncomfortable for me. But once I do them I have so much love for myself and I want the same for you too. Little by little K So I think this is enough. Now I have this powder. That's why what I have here for you is courage. "Cause you will need that so much. The word 'courage' comes from 'the heart.' That's because the heart has everything to with love. And I'm sure you've experienced that before. When you do something that you've been avoiding and it's done. *Phew* You feel so good about yourself. That's your love right there. And we all have these things that we are avoiding. I'm going to take the master .bottle, which is this one. I already put some magic inside. So you can see It's got some spraying neck spraying, it's a spraying device. To spray. And I'm going to be mixing this all together for you. Then I will just spray you to sleep with it. And tomorrow when you wake up you will remember. There will be something different about you. But wait for it. So first Oh no, before I put it on I wanted to get one more thing. you will like this. I have this brush right here because you need to take a sample of each of these things. And I'm going to gently make a dot somewhere on your face. Ok. That's how you start making contact with all these magical potions. So this one will go over here. Perfect. That's it. And this one, audacity. Audacity you will need audacity more than anything. Audacity is kind of courage but even more. because you can go so much far- you can go so much further. There. You can go so much further than you ever thought. Once you stop comparing yourself. Once you stop caring what other people think. This is trust. I will tell you how to develop more trust in yourself. Which will decrease your anxiety very much. I just discovered it recently but it's not rocket science. K, a little contact with the blue potion. over here. Yay. K the last one, the small one so this one's awareness. I said this was fun. But but I think this was trust. Actually, it just looked like fun to me. This is trust. It's important that you have it. Right. Very good. So happy that you are staying with me throughout this whole procedure and now I want to tell you about trust. You need to build trust in yourself. A little bit more. Well, there's things in our lives that we avoid it because they are painful or uncomfortable or hard. I used to call them tasks. Tasks, and I;d put them on a list. And they never got done because that just doesn't sound any good to me. And then I realized that when I don't do those things that are important, then I feel very anxious. So I started calling them acts of love because those are acts of self-love and I'm sure you have some of those on your list. Maybe and invisible list as well. Because those can be some conversations that need to be finished. Some completion Something to do. And I know you have more fun things to do but those are acts of love, so morning when I wake up I think about them and I get inspired because I know that when I do them *psssh* I'm gonna be downloaded with this love for myself. So, I love doing those now and you will too. So let me mix all of these together. You get one drop of each. K That's enough. One drop is totally all you need. I'll mix it in a minute. So this is trust. Now, I'm going to put a bit of courage You already know why. Pink. It's beautiful and pink. You need two drops of this. Oh! Oooh you got like at least five drops Well good. You totally deserve it, you need it. Oh and also with the trust. You won't procrastinate as much anymore. However, people who don;t procrastinate they are more productive but people who do procrastinate, like myself, they tend to be more creative. "Cause some ideas simply need to marinate. So you will find the perfect balance. Oh what an interesting sound. So this is audacity. From now on you'll have this courage to really do all these things that before you thought they were just too daring. You just wouldn't go there. But, here it is, you need to go there. This is where a lot of self-love is. There. Take it. Take all of it. This is going to be so good. They also have different smells, I put some essential oils so it kind of smells like flowers and some trees. There's a bit of eucalyptus in the green, the audacity. That will give you that power. What was this one? Oh, yes. Awareness. Well the awareness is also tied to the procrastination. And just really distinguishing when you should procrastinate right and you shouldn't. Which actions, you should really take. But you don't have to take. When you are hiding because of fear and sometimes when you are just waiting. Because your pace is slower. So distinctions. Awareness. And the more you love yourself the more you'll be aware of what's going on. Because you don;t have to be hiding, and you don't have to be chasing all the love outside. Needing it from others. It will come to you. Once you have it for yourself. "Cause all the relationships you have are just mirrors for you. Right. Awareness. K Great. So this is it. Your powerful self-love elixir has been made. Before you fall asleep completely make sure you subscribe for my videos. Finally. Because I don't want you to miss any of my future videos. Right. It's been mixed. It's ready to land all over you. To cover you in magic, love. You can always remember to this video, whenever you need it. And you know that you need it when you look for love outside of yourself. "Cause you can never find it there. Not unless it's stolen away, anyway. But once you have it for yourself magic will happen and this is more than enough. Doesn't love smell so good? I love you too. That's why I'm making this elixir for you. Just to show you what I'm seeing in you. Well that's enough. Leave it to absorb into your hair and into your skin and have a beautiful night. Goodnight. Oh jeez.
