time to get you ready for takeoff you click the call button so I am here to help I can see you need assistance even if you don't see me well how could you look at all this obscuring your vision this is a whole lot of fear I need to cut this away because it's not letting you see clearly it's ok to be scared but when it builds up like this it's hard to get your bearings there you are hello my name is Heather and you are stuck that's okay everyone gets stuck from time to time I'm here to help you spread your wings so that you can fly again let me take a look around you to assess the situation all right you're in good hands I promise don't you worry I am a specialist and all things adherent agglutinate resinous tenacious stubborn unshakable and trans agenda in short I can get you unstuck but first things first let's take everything weighing you down off of you so I have a scanning want it finds things that test your mettle and I'm going to set it to baggage we all have it but sometimes we can misplace it and it can be hard to locate green lights on I'm just going to wave it over your body until we find what we're looking for okay let's see what we have here disappointments everyone carries these around every so often accepting them doesn't mean loving that these things happened it just means that you're acknowledging that they occurred and organizing and storing them in a way that won't continue to weigh you down I'm going to place this on the scale you can clean them after we're done or you can let them go in the meantime I'll print a baggage claim ticket in case there's anything you want to take with you when we're finished now I can't assist you with unpacking this that's not my department what I can do is put everything you own in this box to the left all right we'll continue looking just waving the wand slowly up and down and across what do we have here the steaks with meat or others have made against us these are never much fun it's good to keep these in mind so that you learn from them but you don't need to take this with you everywhere it's too heavy too you know have to travel late I like to think of us as scientists believe his research figure out if there are positive results that you've gotten from each situation and take those with you instead those are much later to the next one uh-huh Oh trauma I will handle this one with care don't worry these are very important they impact your perspective stages of development expectations so many different things they're kind of like a ripple effect we don't always see how far the ripples go the problem is when they aren't a source of strength and become a hindrance they used to make you who you are but they don't have to define you that's a lot for one person okay looks like we got everything so we'll need that anymore before I continue I'd like to offer you a complimentary beverage I have a nice ice-cold glass of spite for you okay okay so now I need to check your fuel gauge so please hold cell for me oh okay this needs to be addressed for sure so let's refill your heart container so that you can keep on keepin on I see you keep this locked up tight not to worry I hold the lock and I hold the key I always have a spare set a brand new heart container for you so I'm just going to pour the fuel from this into yours all right stop it off hold onto the container and I will lock yours for safekeeping perfect it looks like you are chained to some things and security not to worry feather aviation flight attendants are always equipped with the proper instruments after all safety is our first priority I'll just cut the jeans so that you are free to move about the cabin of life sometimes we get paralysis by analysis and end up staying very still well everything builds up around us and then you feel surrounded by this looming mountain of mess let's take everything you want to leave behind and chain it down so it can't find its way back to you the only way to get up in the air it might take a while and it might not be the smoothest takeoff but you can make it down that runway and it'll be much easier without these chains please sit back and relax while I show you a few things that will make your flight a safe and comfortable experience your seat belt will keep you from harm to fasten flay's the metal end into the buckle until you hear a click pull the loose end to tighten to open pull the top of the buckle in the unlikely event of an emergency landing set the life vest overhead and bring the belt around your waist buckle to inflate use the oral tube you also have a whistle should you need to attract attention don't be afraid to call for help should you need it should there be a rapid change in cabin pressure an oxygen mask will drop place the mask over your nose or mouth with the band over your head and breathe normally just breathe last but not least your wings you burn knees open them on you I believe you can fly okay you all ready for takeoff I'll see you in the sky
