this was right hey and welcome to the ent clinic my name is dr. whispers right and I shall be conducting any necessary treatment for you today now I have been told that you have expressed an interest in ear candling said correct excellent well as you know it's one of the treatments we provide here as a method of earwax removal it's extremely effective in some cases I do however need to just ask you a few questions first to ascertain as to whether this is the correct treatment for you okay and if you don't mind I would like to have a good look in your ears as well thank you okay so my questions are is your earwax internal hard or is it soft okay right and do you suffer from migraines or headaches in general how often if so right okay and do you ever suffer a loss or reduction in your hearing mm-hmm right okay how about went swimming okay right and do you ever experience an itchy throat I mean when it's kind of itchy across the top and you feel the need to rub your tongue of course worth of your mouth yeah okay all right well that's fine so next I would like to look into your ears if that's okay well I have just the tool for the job you can close your eyes if you wish right I think I will start with this side mm-hmm side like okay that's all fine so if you are happy to go ahead then so am i I'm happy with all your questions I'm happy with the state of your ears I think that the treatment will be successful for you I think also that it will be nice and relaxing a good experience all around so would you like me to explain a little bit more about the procedure okay all right here we have an ear candle this is the top end and this is where I lied down here is the end that goes into your ear now the candle is placed like so and when it is lit it'll burn all the way down to this point when I will take it out stop it later on we can open this section here and just take a look at what we've removed from your ear now the way this works is when the top end is lit and candle is securely in your ear a vacuum is created which sucks all of the wax and the pollen anything else which may be in your ear canal open to this actually it's extremely relaxing very warming it has been described as very like sitting beside a fire nice and warm inside we quite often people fall asleep that really is fine you can fall asleep I will carry on with the treatment and when it is done now for your safety we will be using this it's basically plate covered in foil looks rather strange but it's very useful it will protect your face and also your clothes from the candle the candle is placed in here and as the candle burns the burned part okay you don't want that to fall on you how does that sound so if you're ready I will leave the room for about five minutes take your time get yourself ready you may take your shoes off you don't have to do but you may be more comfortable and lie down on the bed just to put your head on the pillow relax take a deep breath calm I will come back in cover you up we can get started so I'll leave you now when I come we can begin your treatment right are you comfortable excellent well you may keep your eyes open or closed whatever you wish but mainly I just want need to remain relaxed so let's begin we'll start by placing and then place this inside you'll hear how does that feel we just need to keep it in the same place just to retain the back now you start to feel the warm sensation good calming sensation as the flame moves down the candle it's slowly drawing all of the impurities and all the excess wax out of your ear canal and up into the bottom of the candle you may start to hear crackling noise don't be alarmed that's just the wax breaking up anywhere move embrace so now I'm going to start just very gently massaging that's right the candle is burning nice and slowly does that feel let's kid just that's burning nicely nice and slow so if you like that's the treatment and when it's finished we can open up the bottom of the counter and see once we've taken from your ear you should probably do this about every six months that's not as much you need that's fine you just wanna sleep close your eyes okay see you when you wake up
