thing that she said wrapped in a tartan ribbon you here it's a book called small pleasures to save your life sorry the author is Maeve heron good bread warm towels crisp mornings girls night out eating the froth of the cappuccino these are the ordinary pleasures that make life worth living yet sometimes other things in our lives can be so overwhelming that we forget the healing power of these simple pleasures in this inspiring book best-selling author Mather and describes how the little things in life can prove to be the most satisfying swapping jokes with a shopkeeper or getting a smile from another driver when you let them into traffic makes you feel better about yourself then any self-help book the sight of a loved one's face waiting for you at the end of a journey reminds you of what really matters while the smell of freshly mown grass can fill you with happiness and enthusiasm for the day ahead small pleasures to save your life celebrates hundreds of these everyday delights all designed to remind us how joyful life is let's have a look inside and I'll read you a few things pages introduction we live in a world where change is fast and we can't control it life is stressful and sometimes we feel powerless we may not have religious faith to depend on families once around the corner are often either fractured or distant even marriage isn't the reliable safety net against loneliness it once was we are richer than ever before and we buy more Goods than any previous generation and yet statistics keep showing that way unhappier than ever and in recent times the cold wind of economic cutback kills us all forcing us to make savings wherever we can so what you can rely on isn't lie on that isn't immoral illegal or wildly expensive to make you feel that despite all this life is wonderful the answer is small pleasures okay number one is listing three good things we all have an inner voice that criticizes us and undermines us often it encourages us to compare our lives with other peoples and feel envious other people seem to have better lives newer cars more money nicer children or even in a subtler way they may seem to get what they want more or be calmer or more sorted than we feel ourselves the answer when the env demon gets his poisoned claws into you is to remind yourself that Envy only damages one person that's you instead of feeling envious list three good things that have happened today good idea this is one of my favorites good bread I grew up in a world of sliced white and can still remember the shock when I came to London at 16 and encountered unsliced granary bread it was warmed from the baker's oven nutty flavored with a darkened crust and entirely delicious bread would never be the same again even more amazing was that it was Sunday and the bread had just been baked in the small town where I grew up shops weren't open on Sundays and certainly no bakers this was long before supermarkets started baking their own bread on the premises so this granary bread summed up both New Horizons of taste and city sophistication for me this one is really sweet and I remember when Katie sent this to me I opened it at this page it's entitled buying yourself flowers in a perfect world all of us would receive a single red rose from our husband or lover on Valentine's Day a bouquet from our friends every birthday and a bunch of daffodils from our children to say thank you for being a wonderful mother suddenly the truth is rather different which is why the only person who will get you flowers you deserve is you personally I feel flowers are more of an essential than a luxury flowers are like sunshine or familiy and music they instantly lift your mood the greatest pleasure of all is to pick them from your own garden you don't need money just a couple of roses stuck in a jug look great I'll redo this one and then I will randomly flick through I love this one clean sheets is there anything on earth is satisfied as slipping between newly laundered crisp clean sheets I have a few foibles here I like them to be pure cotton if possible and by preference white with a white duvet cover but I'm prepared to make allowances hotels have a knack of making sheets smoother and crisper than you can get at home one of the special joys of staying in when I find I once stayed in a hotel that had a special pillow selection that they brought round on the trolley but for me pillows aren't as important as the smooth embrace of freshly laundered cotton so wash your bedsheets have a shower or a bath wash your hair dry your hair and jump into bed to find one bit that's quite special stargazing if you ever feel don't we all that your own little problems are getting on top of you go stargazing there's something about the grandeur of the night sky and the infinity of the stars that makes you feel both peaceful and full of wonder to really appreciate a starry starry night head away from the city because the bleed of the street light dims the extraordinary clarity of the star scape at our small cottage in the English countryside I wonder whether death I climbed to the top of the hill and to sly back and gaze until I almost feel in a trance it takes 15 minutes for your iris to open up fully so you need to be patient and wrap up if the night is clear and cold there is no moon and there's no moon you can see thousands of stars and it doesn't take much knowledge to spot the plough the Great Bear and the pole star and even the distant galaxies of Andromeda even if you can't tell you Orion from your purse Amiga I can't the sheer enormity and brightness of the sky will make you feel that the universe is a pretty amazing place and there's nothing like being outside at night to feel that even in a world overcrowded with millions of people you can occasionally have the planet to yourself during this winter when it's been dark very early dai come back home in my car maybe from the supermarket or write BNE and I sit there in the car I have to turn the end just wait just listen to the sounds around me and then I open the door get out and look at the sky from and just be there for a moment before I get back into there's meant do things planning today so stargazing is one of the things that I like to do now I've read this I'm going to do it for longer okay that was going to be the last one but I've just found another that I want to read this one is going to sleep no matter how tired you are your brain sometimes snaps awake just the wrong moment I have always been a bit of an insomniac wait flatteringly I attribute to being exceptionally energetic my mother was the same despite being full-time doctor and the mother of four if she couldn't sleep she would get up in the middle of the night and start painting ceilings which is all very well but it does leave you exhausted in the morning so I have tried many techniques to get myself to sleep in the dark watches of the night I wonder if she's heard of ASMR I don't think this is the only one that really seems to work get yourself into the decision that you most often sleep in and then go back in time to a house you want to lift in I take myself back to the home we once heard on the sea front of a small provincial town I start outside in the street and walk down the garden path and through the front door from there I walk through each room trying to recall every picture color scheme and piece of furniture in as much detail as possible I find I rarely get beyond the ground floor before I fall asleep it doesn't have to be a house it can be any memory that you can recall in exact detail it's the detail that does it by distracting you from the swirling thoughts that are rushing around your brain and keeping you awake psychologists apparently have a proper name for this visualization but it doesn't need a name it just works it's the detail that does it by distracting you from the swirling thoughts that are rushing round your brain and keeping you awake and it's the detail in the ASMR videos let's stop your swirling thoughts rushing around your head and keeping you awake if you think about it yes Emma doesn't need tonight it just works Thank You Katie for sending me such talk and nourishing gift because I shall be reading this quite often I read most of it as soon as I got it nice meant to be doing some other things I just can't read small pleasures to save your life it's the little things don't forget I hope you enjoyed this stink basket and I hope you liked the sound OH stool you I'm off now go and drink my last piece of the day before going to bed I think I shall take this book with me have read through few more small pleasures before I go to sleep take sleep well and enjoy the little things goodnight
