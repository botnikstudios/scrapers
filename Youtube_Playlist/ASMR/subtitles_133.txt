can I help you I know that it's out there and it can be tiring walking around the museum especially if there were crowds to compete with but this area is for employees only you can go down the hall and you can set up a tour with a door group or get on the phone pamphlets with the museum directory on them at the information desk oh I might have a spare one of those hold on one moment my desk is a little bit cluttered let me see sorry I'm not usually in this room so I am unfamiliar with the territory you can sit if you want to rest your feet relax when I look please save you some time I can find it and some energy normally I'm a tour guide actually until I was to post you know there's a difference between being able to recite facts and loving what you're talking about and I love what I talked about here letting go so the tiniest little building blocks working together just the right circumstances to create elements and amazing life forms I just feel lucky but I get to know about them and see what we came from as a Hornet one nurse you know and sometimes I feel so lucky that I need to touch the exhibit I just want to touch time you know feel things that are amazing if I'll never get to see why sometimes I get in trouble for touching them and I get put in an office my name is Heather what's your name nice to meet you sorry I'm not having much luck finding a pamphlet for you I found the museum storage room where they keep all the specimens that aren't currently on display that could be a pamphlet there who's to say there's not you know what you look really tired you stay there sit I'm gonna go take a look in that storage room for you and maybe find you a pimple it okay just stay right there I will be right back look so I didn't find any pamphlets but I found some really cool things look at this this is a giant squid big penis Arceus lives in the deep dark depths illusion oh let me see the picture for you mmm-hmm like the Honda isn't my strong suit I'm more suited to puzzles good all right so largest giant squid ever recorded what is 43 feet and weighed almost a ton but it's estimated they can grow a 50 to 60 feet long every human illusion I rival the size of many if not most whales really know about them largely comes from carcasses that washer but in 2012 Japan's National Science Museum they recorded alive it's giant squid and its natural habitat they were the first to mention giant squid way back wait way back in the fourth century BC someone named Pliny the Elder wrote about a massive squid in his natural history he said it had 30-foot long tentacles and lead seven this big it was still part of a time so I could cut through steel cable giant squid like others would have two eyes which are enormous I have size of a human head or a dinner plate they have a beak eight tentacles two feeding tentacles on their very very very long and they're tipped with hundreds of suckers with very sharp teeth on the suckers not teeth like you or I have let me see if I can draw your burger use this use this predicate the suckers are just a circle and then we have these little spikes all around them and there are hundreds of these sharp points on the suckers they don't look like much but they are so sharp they can leave deep scars in the skin of sperm whales as they're fighting to escape the whale's mouth as for Mouse League translate here have a closer look so the giant squid is a lady armed sprinkled with these two and tried to use suckers and the transport their prey from the beating tentacles to the sharp beak hmm this may look small to you in this form but well it is attached to the squid there's white muscle the size of a softball so now I'm doing the peak and the beaks are so strong as I stated sperm whales eat giant slide I know this because we find the giant squid beaks in their stomachs they don't break down it's sort of amazing they are difficult to scratch dent-resistant fractures the combination of properties that they are made from makes the beak harder to deform than many metals and polymers and that's pretty amazing because the big itself doesn't contain any minerals or metals it is made solely organic chemicals which makes it a marvel of precision by ordinary attaint squids eyes are the largest in the animal kingdom allowing them to see a dark of the ocean and if we were to go down there we would see nothing it's black but they can see lots of things including bioluminescent prey as well as things we might not even know about yet secrets the squids brain is shaped like a direct and its esophagus runs through the donut hole in the middle the main part of the body is called the mantle it contains all the basic organs and on the body's underside the undercarriage is the funnel it's also called the siphon it pumps water and other fluids it's sort of a multi-purpose tool it allows the giant squid to go through my jet propulsion exhale legs expel waste and of course squirt you want to see what else I found let me put a picture I'll give you a hint it's another creature lips stingray I've haven't stingray tail spine stingrays live in shallow post waters there's sort of like cats and that they spend the majority of their time inactive they bury themselves in the sand and their coloration blends well with the view for camouflaging them from predators like sharks or larger rays they have pectoral fins on their bodies and then their tail trails behind those vism they move through the water by undulating their bodies like a wave or flapping their wings the tail might be used to maneuver a little bit but its primary purpose its protection I mean look how sharp look stingray spine or barb can have serrated edges and very sharp point and they can produce the venom which can be fatal to humans the venom can remain deadly even after must embrace death and they can possess one or more barb stingers on the tail which I use and solved events the stinger may reach a length of approximately 14 inches and it's two groups with venom glands let's see how long this one is almost eight and a half inches the Stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin called the integumentary sheath and that's where the venom is concentrated Neal Therese and porcupine raise to not have stingers though stinger these are not aggressive and interactions with human bee stings chemica if a ray is accidentally stepped on in greek mythology Odysseus the king of Ithaca was killed when his son telegonus struck him using a spear tip with the spine of a stingray if you're concerned about being stoned in shallow water you can shuffle your feet as you wait in the water that way they will be startled by you and they can move along without any complications stingrays use their sense of smell and electro receptors which are also called ampullae of Lorenzini so you Fanta they grow something lies holes of him in cartilaginous fish like chirps these electro receptors or my network Delafield pores that help fish distance electric fields and water even if they cannot see the Braille stingrays feed on mollusks crustaceans and other small fish they bear 5 to 13 young per litter and they bear live milk here's something really interesting at the sea life London Aquarium two female stingrays have delivered seven babies even though they weren't in the presence of a male for two years scientists say that rays can store sperm and not give birth until they decide the timing is right is not incredible it's so sharp it's incredible dear I think someone's coming I have type of stuff running the papers okay so you're going to make a left out of this office I'll draw you a map don't worry people get lost all the time it's not a big deal you're gonna make a left out of this office you're going to follow my way all the way down hello dr. grant once you get to the end of the hallway you'll see a set of stairs go up those stairs look to your right you'll see another hallway with a sign that says restaurants go towards that hallway follow it down and also on the right you will find a store and that is the lost and found all right not a problem let's go from one thing to another yeah this is really cool and heavy this is a Stegosaurus tail spike Stegosaurus was a large dinosaur I lived about 150 to 155 million years ago and Western North America let me show you a picture sorry good okay Stegosaurus lived in the Late Jurassic period it's body with the size of a bus in it had two rows of bony plates on its back I made it appear even bigger how you below so massive it had a brain the shape and size of a hotdog Stegosaurus means roof to lizard and I got that name because nineteenth-century paleontologists believe that the plates on its back or flat like roof shingle and plates are made of a boney material called osteoderms and they have your head lattice like structures and blood vessels and scientists debate about the purpose of the osteo terms plates they're also called scoops sometimes it's believed but they were for temperature regulation other scientists believe but they were for display purposes display purposes meaning species identification or trying to attract a saucy stick as far as my Stegosaurus had spikes at the end of its tail here have a look scientists begin pulling the spikes a go misers after a far side cartoon showed a group of cavemen pulling the sharp spikes angle misers it is believed that these spikes were used for defense against predators because about 10 percent of spikes found or damaged at the tip and scientists have found Allosaurus fossils who Stegosaurus is main predator with puncture wounds from tackle misers allosaurus looked similar to tyrannosaurus rex but it existed millions and millions and millions of years before Tyrannosaurus Stegosaurus wasn't herbivore unlike other big dinosaurs like Triceratops Stegosaurus didn't have strong jaws or grinding teeth its jaws only allowed for up-and-down movements and its teeth were rounded Stegosaurus had a very very weak bite thicker than a human being spiked but it had cheeks which gave it room to chew and store more food sort of like a gigantic scaly chipmunk Stegosaurus most likely ate well like bushes cycads ferns mosses tree stars conifers and even fallen fruit since we're talking about eating let me show you this this is a Nile crocodile is elliptic it's it's the second largest extant reptile next to the saltwater crocodile can grow up to 20 feet long in almost 1,700 pounds the lives in sub-saharan Africa and the help Aysen and even in Madagascar and rivers and mangrove swamps Nile crocodiles have nictitating membranes let me show you a picture Lichter tating membranes are very thin what's translucent membranes that very commonly found on the eyes of reptiles and birds they protect the eyes from dust and debris and also help the eyes retain moisture oh no crocodiles holes lab lacrimal glands which means they do in fact cry crocodile tears but the tears are used to clean out the eyes one closer look Nile crocodiles other nostrils eyes and ears on the top of their heads so the rest of their body can remain concealed under water I can stay underwater probe to thirty minutes a friend and if they stay very very still they can hold their breath for up to two hours they have an ectotherm a metabolism so they can survive for long periods between meals the diet of the Nile crocodile is diverse to say the least they will eat almost anything that crosses its path fish zebras small hippos porcupines Birds other crocodiles or stalks baboons giraffe capable Oh young elephants hyena cheetah African all hugs tackles leopard lion ostrich pythons antelope gazelle water buck bush buck Impala City Tonga kudu Thames pop sable antelope wildebeest and it will scavenge carrion that's another word for deceased Nile crocodile can eat up to half its body weight in a single feeding it is an ambush predator and can wait weeks for the suitable moment to attack don't mistake them for being slow they are agile and swift on land and order you're capable of bursts of speed reaching seven to eight miles per hour on land and 19 to 22 miles per hour and water they have a powerful bite and sharp conical teeth allowing for a grip that is really impossible to escape their ability to apply high levels of force for long periods of time allows them to hold pry underwater especially large right however the muscles responsible for opening the mouth are very weak and can be held shut by a human being their mouths are filled with 64 to 68 teeth on each side of the mouth there are five teeth in the front of the upper jaw 13 to 14 the rest of the upper jaw in 14 or 15 on either side of Florida hatchlings little baby crocodiles have a hardened piece of skin on the top of their mouths and that's called the egg tooth we use that to break through their eggshells at birth but as they grew they lose that mother and father Nile crocodile parents guard their nests until their eggs hatch and they will often roll like gently in their mouths to help patching babies emerge despite their massive sizes another park the topic is null larger than that of goose which there are a lot of eggs in that storage room even prehistoric one editing crap though this is an ostrich egg the ostrich is the world's largest bird it also happens to be flightless it's a resident of the African savanna and desert areas its species name is camelus because like a camel an ostrich has long neck long fluttering eyelashes the ability to tolerate higher temperatures and go for extended periods of time without water ostriches get most of our water from plants that they eat they eat roots seeds insects given and they also eat sand stones and little pebbles so that it can help grind the food and their gizzard ostriches eat their food they collect it in the crop of their mouth until it makes a big enough lump for them to swallow their intestines are 46 feet long that's how they can absorb as many nutrients as possible even though they're flightless ostriches are strong runners they can run 43 miles per hour given chicks that are one month old can run 35 miles per hour they use their wings like rudders to help them change direction they can cover 10 to 16 feet in a single stride each two-toed foot has a long sharp claw and their legs are so powerful their kick cannot kill a human being or even other predators like lions alpha males maintain these herds and mate with groups dominant n and other friends in the group wandering males I also mate with hens but not with the dominant pen all the group's hens place their eggs in the dominant hens nest but hers are given priority in the prominent center space so they have the best chance of hatching even though the eggs are combined each female can identify her own eggs the dominant ten and male take turns incubating the egg more eggs hatch in the communal nest and interpret nests that each would need to be incubated and protected each egg weighs as much as two dozen chicken eggs an average six inches in length let's see how big this one even though the egg is so large they are small in relation to the size of the adult on the eggs hatch after about 35 to 45 days the male primarily defends thatch Ling's and teaches them to feed but the female will join in every now and then as well when needed ostriches do not bury their heads in the sand when threatened ostriches will lie low and press through next to the ground to become less visible their plumage blends with the environment and from a distance it gives the appearance that they have buried their head on machine that's all I can manage to take with me today but I cannot wait to explore that sort drone you see you have to admit it would be more fun if I had someone to show the specimens to do do you think you would want to come back think of it as a tour of the museum walking I'll even give you a pass so that you won't have to pay an entry fee here I hope that you'll come up and see me sometime it'll be our secret Shh the park is open this isn't for tile
