ASMR meditation video using Tibetan (Himalayan) singing bowls for relaxation, sleep and calm. Qi / Ch'i in Chinese, Ki or Gi in Korean or Japanese, Prana in India Hello this is Emma Welcome to a Qi (Ch'i) sounds meditation for calm and for balance. This video is intended to be, through sound, a lovely charge of positivity for you. A space for you to gain some balance right now. Our lives are pretty overwhelming for the senses especially if you're particularly sensitive even if your life is going really well right now it's still common to be in a state of high alert with all the sounds, the smells the decisions we make conversations we have financial obligations we have to deal with a constant use and exchange of energy all part of day to day living on this planet So we're going to use some sounds today, in the same way we use ASMR sounds. To focus the mind, focus the senses, create a state of stillness and peace. Just like in meditation. Get out of the fight or flight mode and into a lower brain wave state. Lower the heart rate and arrive in a place which is often called a place of healing. Healing is a word I interpret to just really be your organs and nervous system working more efficiently. To full capacity. Keeping your cells happy and functioning well. It's also a place where your mind or consciousness can process information or events. The word Qi is in the title because that means 'Life Force' 'The energy that sustains all life' Our external environment affects our internal world of course, both physically and mentally and sound as we know, is energy. So these Himalayan singing bowls will fill your environment with beauty and positivity. Some external Qi to strengthen your inner Qi. So sit back, pop on your headphones if you like and enjoy ðŸ’œ All the LOVE from me XX
