Good evening This video is going to be quite simple I'm going to use all things that have to do with sleepy time I'm going to speak very softly and very slowly and hopefully that will help you relax deeper and Hopefully make you somewhat sleepy the first thing we're going to review is a pillow Something that you cannot go to sleep without This pillow has different embroideries on it With coins and sequins attached as well as pieces of just threads and disturbed fabric pieces and it is just an introduction to this It's quite soft And it makes a nice tingly sound I don't know how relaxing that is, but I would like to make a suggestion that has to do with pillow You know sometimes you might Have difficulty falling asleep and Nothing is helping you So there's something that you can do you can lay your head down on the pillow Ear down and Glide your hand right next to yourself on the pillow Ever so gently glide and this will sound like ocean waves Simply recreates the effect or a shawl when you put it next to your ear and you listen to it and it sounds like ocean waves This is very similar amplifying technique I create a natural white noise sound And this slower you do it The more relaxing it gets I suggest you try that it feels very nice You know soon to a similar thing When you lay on your back like this, and you can glide both or your hands On each side either one at a time Or together Let me give you an example Doesn't it feel good? creates an nice smoothing sound Plus just gliding your hand over it could relax you as well so try that The next object we have is a wonderful blanket It is so soft so squishy So soft so squishy Let me rub it on your cheek And the other cheek Feels good so soft And we're going to tuck you in Let me open it up. [yeah], and I'm going to wrap it around you Just put this over your shoulder in here And the same thing on this side now And just tuck it into here so it stays Let me just tuck it in under your chin Now you're all snuggly Swaddled like a baby, snug as a bug So I'm going to massage over the blanket a little bit I'm going to massage your neck I'm going to give you a squeeze on your traps like this ten-second squeeze That is so awesome I'm going to rub your chest circular motions right here and your shoulders on both sides And I know you're going to enjoy it And as I do that, I would like to tell you about the benefits of this So anytime you feel warm as if you've been hugged or touched anytime You feel loved You release a wonderful hormone.
