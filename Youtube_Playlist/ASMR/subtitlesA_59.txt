my books so I wanted to show you love it well not sure you would tell you a little bit about shouts right here the word satsang in Japanese she I'm sorry the word shiatsu is Japanese she reversed her finger and Matsu means pressure the Japanese Ministry of Health defines shiatsu as a form of manipulation by thumbs fingers and palms without the use of instruments mechanical or otherwise to apply pressure to the human skin to correct internal malfunctioning promote and maintain health and treat specific diseases so the techniques used in shiatsu include stretching holding at most commonly cleaning body weight into various points along key channels great all the movement is supposed to come from your Hara when the massage therapist creates a shiatsu protocol they will become e from their horror or sacral chakra Orange it is our vital center of life it is our center of gravity it is three two module on the ambiguous and three tuned deep inside belly soon once I cleared out one two is one thumb three is four fingers so it is four fingers under your belly button and the same depth into that position inside of you so it has basically a chakra odds sacral chakra so it talks a lot about anything yang talks about that one does not exist without the other Union eating is active in this passive you can see it right here yeah happen Yin is earth Jane is function substance is revealed yes mind/body masculine when you have this extreme okay or here in your body ah it transformed into the opposite so good one okay when extremely or extremely angry reaches its limit it transformed and its opposite for example extreme activity necessitates rest so activity here being yang Yang being rest if activity is very fierce such as war which is yang then death get result which is he just still get it it's for spear extreme examples so I'm just reading to tell you that there's always two sides and there's no life without both science the good the bad the booth has to combine to come in the middle and to reach balance and that balance is what life is we cannot live without one or the other it does not exist one does not exist without the other and no matter what your thoughts or opinions are you always still have to be respectful and understand that there also other opinions that matter just as much as yours do even if you do not agree or vice versa if you are victorious and you are happy that your opinions correct at this time it does not mean that the other opinion is now correct so at this time how about we do a little bit more of human and then I will let you be and so you can go to sleep or just rest I know it's not a very sleepy do what I am doing my mind best right now in my position in this situation I tried to do my best of all time right now
