oh it's been such a long time oh hello Li long how are you what have you got there oh how interesting I haven't seen these in such a long time a book perfect thank you what would you like to know if you'd like to know what there are these these ruins this is something that people of the old time would use similar to tear apart or astrology these are beliefs people had I've had these for such a long time and I haven't seen them thank you for filing them for me oh you'd like to know more about them okay well what you would normally do is it I would do I root a reading for you and that's something they might give you dancers to question to you I have oh it like a reading from old old granddad okay hmm been such a long time just give me a minute and just let me have a look at what we can do - these are some of the different rooms and they all have commands and meanings this book is quite old many years ago I look into this why an interesting story some time ago when I was younger similar to your age I spoke to someone someone that might you might call as a psychic person and she mentioned that in one of my past lives I was a good which is a quite interesting not that I recall any of this previous past life but she suggested that I look into trying some wounds and then I may find them quite interesting and so after some time I decided to purchase a bag of runes in this book and I quite enjoyed it and I found a connection with these runes and I believe that I have a connection with these runes that allows me to help find a correct room for yourself or myself let me just have a look here we go okay I think this is something we can do it's called a runic cross and what this does is it gives you a little bit of a our overview to the past the future where you are now any challenges that you might have situations and sort of like a foundation that might help you we could do something like that if you like just give me one moment okay oh we have a question how do I select the correct room that is a very interesting question and I think it's very important question to to understand so for myself personally I believe each person has to find their own way of doing things and so for myself I find that I have like a kind of like a sense in my hand that when I find the right room it seems to stick to my finger and I carefully draw it out and whether the room is upside down or the correct way up will change the meaning and it's not in a bad way it's just a way the difference can be drawn out of the back now you do not have to draw around if you do not like I can do it for you so how'd it'll work is you you need to think of a a question or a problem that you may have that you would like to some guidance or some help with ok so just just think for a second how does the rooms move that answers your questions I can't really explain that but the way that my belief is that that the runes are son is on type of connection and and that you know what the answer is in the room to trying to help you to give you guidance to help you find your correct path that will help you in your journey okay let us begin now you must think of a question it could be a question of will I do well at school or maybe better ways what do I need to do to achieve the result that I'm looking for whether it is in school work in a relationship whether its financial so I want you now to think I've had a question and just close your eyes and just think of that question and now those clothes and yeah we shall draw their eyes so that's right is the running of the path and so here I try and concentrate to feel the correct line for you sometimes it just takes a little bit of time just give me one moment [Music] [Applause] we have drawn which one is this okay so that one will be your past that is degree manners this is really obsessed the self if you feel blocks mana is protégée to begin by being clear with yourself do not turn to others now but look inside for what is blocking me the knower one area of your life is in disarray stop and consider you will recognize the outer enemy as but a reflection of what you have not until now have been able or willing to recognize as coming from looking above all do not give yourself airs taking the moment in the past habit is the challenge here so here your question it's about you and so in the past there have been things have been blocking you and even seeking to remove those blocks so that there is your past and then is good because you know and you already know that you have something that's stopping you and here we will try and answer and give you some suggestions on how you might move forward in this situation or question the future the future is always online unwritten you can make of it or you cannot be scared that you not be afraid for challenges sometimes you must leap the chasm to get to the other side and once you're there all feel fly away we have another [Music] so we have jong-un constant reversed I counsel against expecting too much or expecting in the ordinary way for the old way has come to the end you simply cannot repeat the old and not suffer calling your scattered energies concentrate on your own life at this moment for your only requirement for growth more important this room counseled you to need a focus on outcomes not bind yourself with the memory of past achievements form doing sorry you rob yourself of the true present moment the only time in which self change can be realized you may feel overwhelmed with exhaustion from meeting abstraction upon abstraction in your passage yet always you have a choice you can see this apparent negativity as bad luck or you can recognize it as an obstacle course a challenge specific it to the initiation that you are presently undergoing to test your character so yeah you may come across some roadblocks in your future but instead of being dismayed or disappointed or or feeling stress from a situation look at like an obstacle course something for you to overcome a challenge and this is something that will help you grow in character do not be afraid of obstacles things that block you can give it as a challenge fear overcome so that you may find your true path now we choose the rune of where you are now I see what have we chosen can I reverse this so this room is where you are now I want to read it what it says the danger is that through hasty or ill-timed action life force leaks out or is spilled away if an association is short-lived do not grieve know that it has fulfilled expand matters of trust and confidence are at issue here and with them the authenticity of your way of being in the world reversed this calls for examining your motives carefully why doing some of the things that you're doing is it self conquest with which you are concerned or are you trying to dominate another are you lusting after outcomes or are you focus on the task of return sake you will find answers within yourself not in outside advice when you consult the runes you are consulting the self an appropriate action to the spiritual warrior you are the spiritual warrior you do not need to seek answers from other people you have all the answers that you need trust in yourself follow your instinct now we look at the foundation something that might be give you information to help you like ours let's see if one is the correct way flow water that which conducts so this is about your foundation unseen powers are active here powers that nourish and Shake and connect so there is an underlying force here that you have access to all you need to do is become and focus and relax and listen to yourself the attribute of this room are water fluidity and the ebb and flow of emotions careers and relationships this room encourages you to immerse yourself in the experience of living without having to evaluate what understand it speaks to the satisfaction of emotional needs to the awakening of the intuitive or lunar side of your nature for while the Sun strives for differentiation the meaning draws us towards its union and merging this room often signals a time for cleansing for revaluing and reorganizing and realigning a rule of deep knowing that as means to call you to study spiritual matters in readiness for self transformation success now lies in contacting your intuitive wisdom and attuning to your own rivers a rune of the self relating rightly to the self this ruin signifies what Alchemist called the conject Isle or the sacred marriage in fairy tales it is the end where the hero and the heroine live happily ever after so this room I believe is confirming this pattern of cross that you are on her pathway a journey there will be many obstacles that you must overcome to not be scared to not be worried look at them as a challenge something for you to overcome and each obstacle that you overcome you will get closer to your goal which is just to be simply you to be happy in your skin to be happy with your achievements to be happy but also to find more achievements to find more it will help you to grow and when you find the challenges overcome them oh the challenge let us see or we draw here gerrae so this room cannot be reversed this is the harvest the fertile season a room of beneficial outcomes gerrae applies to any activity or endeavor to which you are committed be aware however that no quick results can be expected a span of time is usually involved hence the keywords one year symbolizing a full cycle before reaping the harvest of a deliverance you have prepared the ground and planted the seed now you must cultivate with care to those who labor a long season along coming to term gerrae offers encouragement of success know that the outcomes is in keeping of the Providence and continue to preserve remember the old story about the farmer who was so eager to assist his crops that he went out at night and hugged on the new shoots there is no way to push the river equally you cannot hasten the harvest be mindful that patience is essential for recognition of your own process which in its season leads to the harvest yourself so here again this room confirms that you are on the correct path way you will have challenges but the patient's there will be data comes in the very near future we realize that you have achieved a number of things that you hold dear to you be patient and give a time to those dreams to realize themselves at the last room the new situation so this room might tell us what it is the you will achieve with patience and overcoming obstacles this room is yours so again this refers to movement that appears to block be certain in what you're doing I'm not doing is timely there are no missed opportunities you have simply to reorganize or recognize that not all opportunities are open to you that not all possibilities are for you the opportunity at hand may be precisely to avoid action if you are feeling at a loss or unclear about the need to act consider what is timely to your nature and remember what is yours will come to you so this might signify that and maybe some of your dreams may not be achievable and that you could be satisfied with other thoughts or or dreams that you may have so where you majoring to go to the moon you may end up being happy just being someone that works on the ground and if you desire something maybe reduce your expectation on what it is that that you would like I think it's really important just to be happy with what you've got think about it really what is it that you need to be happy it's your thoughts it's you your mind your health some water some food some shelter friends and family these are the things that you should value most in life did you enjoy that little one ah you always welcome to come back and see granddad all right I think it's time no no
