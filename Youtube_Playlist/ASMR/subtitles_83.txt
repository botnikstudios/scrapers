[in a whisper] Good evening This video is going to be very quiet. Shhhh. Very light whispers here and there. But mostly, I'm going to give you a head massage. Relaxing, sleepy head massage. Just like that. Massages are so relaxing. So hypnotizing. Both to you, the one who receives it, and to the one who gives it. It strengthens our bond, and I'm just excited to spend time with you. [indistinct] I'm also going to be using this tool. This tool—you will, I'm sure—have seen already before. And used it, too. Sounds like wind chimes. A little bit. [metallic clinking] Shoop, shoop, shoop. [rustling noises] We understand each other about this. I know it. That's pretty cool. You get what I feel. You know exactly how I feel. And that is incredible. So, I love to comfort you, and have some quiet time with you. We both need it. I need some time with you, too. Just being here by your side. Just enjoying your company. The sounds of the head massage is... so soothing. Makes me sleepy, too. So, I'll do some hand movements here. And a little bit of tapping. [exhales] I have a new brush. That is very similar to the previous one, also from Russia. But this one has a... beautiful bird image carved in the back of it. Kinda matches my nails. I'm into stamping on the nails... I'll tell you later... [inhales] It smells like a... cedar tree. [tapping] And it sounds... just as heavenly, if not better. Than the other brush. Let's do it slowly. [slow tapping] Shhhhhhhhh... Shhhhhhhhh... [tapping slowly increases in speed] [hair brushing sounds] Making me so sleepy. Let me put it away. Now... [whooshing sounds] Just gliding my hands over you. [crinkling noises] Sleep... it is so comfortable here. So simple. So quiet. Perfect space for you to drift off. [crinkling noises continue] [inhales deeply]
