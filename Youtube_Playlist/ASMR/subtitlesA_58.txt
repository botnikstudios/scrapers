hello and welcome to a vibrational massage treatment we're going to be using Himalayan balls directly on the body today so we're working with lovely sound vibration I'm also going to be bringing in some crystals and I'll talk about tuning into the person you're working with and also doing a full-body scan before beginning the treatment okay you want to check that your person is lovely and relaxed and comfortable that's very important so it straighten out our clothes around the ankles and even just give them a gentle roll there on the hips press down on the shoulders just encourages them to relax let's start with some crystals crystals are a perfect accompaniment to any treatment it's kind of like having two treatments any one having the crystals around you can choose whichever crystals you think would be right for the person you're working with today I went for amethyst which is a very high vibrational spiritual stone it's useful for so many different things it's one of my favorites and I don't really don't go a day without holding some amethyst it's very calming today we're going to ask for some emotional centering some clarity of thought and enhanced intuition from the amethyst so I went for points today and I'm going to place those around Ruth's head if you're using points you can point them towards you to drawing the energy from the crystal or you can point it away from you to draw energy out of you kind of like energy plucking birds in a nice gentle way it's around here I wouldn't advise placing all crystals by the head it's important to choose wisely amethyst is fine just have a read up on all the crystals you are using and then your life now let's tune in to our person if you're particularly empathic or sense - this comes quite easily but I do believe that anyone can do this it's just about developing that extra sense or that extra sensitivity just through practice and getting used to feeling how other people feel around you so tuning in is basically becoming one with the person you're working with tuning into them feeling how they feel and you can also use it to set your intention for the session so you just place a hand or two hands over their heart center take some nice deep breaths and eventually you start to breathe at the same time you can take a moment to say to yourself something like May healing sounds flow through me and when they go to wherever they are needed oh you could say my healing sounds flow through me and may they go to Ruth's highest good something like that whatever works for you you can be a spiritual or religious or anything you want nothing is wrong but what is important is your intention always you've probably tuned into your person already without realizing it but it's nice to start this way and be aware take this moment now we're going to move on to scanning the body as you know your body is made up of trillions of cells all working away doing their own thing moving around keeping themselves busy on their tasks at hand and movement creates energy so your body is radiating energy all the time and you have layers of energy all around your body each layer creates another layer and this is called the aura so I'm going to scan the aura and we might detect a blockage or a gap in your or somewhere and there are lots of ways to do this you can use sound you can use hand you can dowse with a pendulum so if we were to use sound and we could use the voice which is probably my favorite it's the most personal it's very gentle but before I became confident using my voice I used a chime and anything with a nice clear tone will work this is very very gentle so we just strike the time I run it over person around the aura when you hear a dip in the sound that's generally the area you need to focus your intention to work on okay we don't go over an area too many times don't know need to go back you've gone over once don't forget to round the head to use the voice you just need to very simply choose a tone that you're comfortable with and tone over the body we can do proper toning which is the way that the Buddhist monks tone it takes a lot of practice I just do a nice player sound like that all around Oh like I said you could use hands that's a nice way to do it if you are into Reiki you can do it that way you can do the Reiki symbols on your hands oh yeah well you can ask for universal energy scan your hands over the body like this and everyone feels this differently but usually you will feel an extra heat sensation or a tingle palm with your hands if you want to open up your hands first open up your palms you can do this like I said this no mistakes nothing is wrong you find your own technique and as long as your intention is there then it's right always as with everything in life intention is everything finally you can scan the body using a pendulum I'll show you mine my pendulum is chef on amethyst good for decision-making and diagnosis okay so we can douse the chakras with our pendulum I don't know if you've ever used a pendulum before but you would hold it like this the chakra and say show me yes or I'll show me now and your pendulum will move in different directions according to the answer so we hold it over the show cruise and so so and we can do a body scan that toy okay so now we have scanned the body and usually by this time your person is extremely relaxed and melting off it's a nice atmosphere okay so let's begin the ball massage now I'm going to be using a small bowl this is my G bowl and it has a handle inside she just helps me to move it around the body I just place it gently on the lower back here okay use my mallet here you might want to just hold a ball on your person's body before you do anything else before you start the treatment just so that they're aware of how it's going to feel but it's very nice very gentle and it's through practice that you would know how much pressure to add how hard to beat the ball okay so gently press down and beat the side of the ball move it across the lower back so a small ball just gives you the ability to move around easier move it up very slowly side of the spine back down again not to go too close to the head because the vibrations are quite strong and it can be quite uncomfortable those travel up back up the skull just go probably up shoulder blade there and then move around the hips again okay I know we can go up the other side of the spine if you feel you need to hold in any places that's fine too and those lovely vibrations will go through the body feels lovely the pressure of the bowl it's nice to have such a lovely round base so massages the muscles along with the sound and then we go across the back again you can apply quite a bit of pressure down here okay so now we want to go down the Lex I quite like to hold it over the car myself and vibrate through the leg back up again you always want to use a nice soft bata anything harder would be too harsh in the sound would grate a little bit back up to the lower back I'm concentrating on grounding and balance here so I'm keeping focus around the lower back and the hips just to bring the vibrations up spend a little bit more time in that area and down the other leg again I'm going to hold a it's over the car it's for sure lovely vibrations she can hear the ball still vibrating and sounding as you go across it does go for quite a long time we were to hold it you really listened the ringing for quite a while like still going on [Music] finally we can just bring the ball right down the side to the side of the hip then across again [Music] across background to the base of the spine okay can even feel vibrations just holding your hand just there around the outside of the ball so you can go up and down as many times as you like but just be mindful of not overdoing it sometimes little is more okay pop that back there and finally just to finish off the massage I'm going to bring in my big F heart Bowl it's quite heavy and it probably looks like it's a little bit too much but actually it just feels really really lovely and comforting when on the body as long as it's placed in the right area so I'm going to pop it here which i think is about the only place I would place this on the back just there and we strike it or hear the sound and the waves will go right through this whole area here and resonate through the bone just a lovely feeling so just give it a nice spin around load the weight feel nice on the bottom of its back and depending on the shape of your person you might need to support your bomb a little bit so I'm going to place my fingers underneath this side remember the sound carries on for a long long time so you can wait to do its thing and I'll have some deep relaxation going on right now I can see somebody touches some rays which means she's in deep relaxation you might also hear some tummy rumbles those are all body signs of relaxation once we get into rest and digest mode that's when our body is working to its full capacity your organs are working well you're digesting your body's doing its work that's why it's important to relax [Music] when you're ready just very gently lift the ball off the body back and that concludes our vibrational massage treatment I hope you enjoyed that if you did do let me know and maybe next time I can show you a treatment where we place the balls on the body and leave them in certain areas there's one position especially which I like to use to deal with feelings of anxiety and it really works for me so there we are thank you for watching I hope you sleep well good night you
