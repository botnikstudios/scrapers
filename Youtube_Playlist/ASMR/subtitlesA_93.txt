[about nail polish] I just like it so much I think its very lovely color Kind of like, um, pink mixed gold together lovely [repeated] sk [repeated] Because I want to you hear the best sound so I just used this microphone hope you like it~ And I just got new ones But somebody told me this cute stuff actually from Japan, is that true? I'm not sure because, in China we also have it Actually when I was young, my mom always used these to help me clean my ears It's very very soft Can you feel it? It's very soft soft [repeated] [lip smacking sounds] And also I have double these... ...little brushes and I think that I buy some makeup and they give to me for free I think it's eye shadow brush, it's kind of smaller [blows in ear] [tapping brushes] [tapping brushes] [blowing] Which one you think is better? [blows] Got to treat the right one (ear) Brush it I think this big one is for... blush [repeats] For here (cheek) so it's very big and soft soft so soft~ Tap, gently I tap I'll slowly tap tap your ears to relax, relax now tap [repeated] and tap here Your head [blowing] [blowing] [blowing sounds like wind] [tapping brush] I just try to do everything I think it's more relaxing What do you think? and just like what I said... It's very very very dry in L.A. , it is no more dry but those days super dry So I can't without body lotion. And this one is um..I use it after moving to America So it's more then two years [tapping] And it's called Love Addict I don't know what that means but it kind of seems very lovely scent And also today I want to give you a little bit of ear massage But this time it'll be special. We're going to it very gently ...just enjoy the sound So what kind of massage is your favorite? I mean we have a lot of different styles alright I have head, ear, neck um..back, foot, leg. A lot of different styles. I can say my favorite is foot massage~ Actually Chinese, they love foot massages very much because we think the foot is your second heart in your body So if you massage them often it's really going to be relaxing and it's good for your health And it's very good if you take a walk, if you go outside to walk very long, it's good to have a foot massage. So I'm not going to waste it, I will just put it on my hands [the lotion] And let me help you clean a little bit [repeating what sounds like posty] [repeating staple] [repeating click] I have cream on my hands so it's going to be hard to do a finger flutter flutter [taps brushes] [whisper] I'm starting to enjoy this actually. I don't know, maybe [can't hear over brushes, sounds like "cutie/beauty contest] [more blowing] [clicking tongue] I know Japan have a lot of very good inventions. I'm really interested in a lot of Japan, and I hope one day I can to go there They have a lot of cute stuff there and also they have my favorite, Hello Kitty [repeating lollipop] [now repeating coconut] Is (there) any city or country you want to go to?
