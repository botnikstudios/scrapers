I was right a hello thank you for coming in today please take a seat okay so I was told you've been in for a preliminary pointment already mm-hmm okay and yes what did they tell you to do right so you've been soaking your ears with olive oil for two weeks every day twice a day excellent that's great okay so that should make your job a lot easier today right mm-hmm could you just confirm your so name please yep okay great I have everything else your records are up to date from your last appointment so if you're ready and we can get started okay good so first I will begin by using my cotton buds to just clean the outside of your ears I will go very gently so no need to worry I'll just clean around the tops and just inside the crevices just that okay and once that's done we'll all be prepared then to flush out your ears but first I want to have a good look inside just to make sure that the work you've been doing over the last two weeks has really made a difference should hopefully have softened everything inside your ear canal and that will mean when I flush out your ears everything will just fall out very easily okay so let's have a look okay just a tiny bit of water on the club wall there just very gently clean the outside very soft and gentle on the outside just here the crevice is the around the top that should feel nice and cool oh yeah that's the first one now on the other side on the top we gently cleaning around the edge and again very gently in the crevice pay particular attention to the inside where any dry skin turd breasts and cluck nice and clean so now both of your ears on the outside are nice and clean my next thing is to just have a look inside down your retina make sure that any wax has been softened over the last two weeks I'm pretty sure that if you've been doing it twice a day using your olive oil be fine using my light right into the a canal I'll start with this here look good yeah that's good so looking the other ear oh yes mm-hmm well actually we have slightly less this year than the other area which is fine this year should take less time to do three right that goes back on there now I'm going to brush out your ears don't worry this is absolutely painless and seeing as you have softened all of your wax in either side really shouldn't be a problem at all everything should just flow out nice and easily okay so if you want to close your eyes you can just relax and just allow me to loosen up all the debris okay so this is what I'll be using it's a large syringe with a very very soft the tip just fits very snugly into your ear canal just in the top doesn't go to foreign and yes very small oh just to the funder this means that I didn't fill up the syringe enough warm water to rinse out urea okay and up the switch got some nice warm water here we don't need a lot I just through the water into this glass here then we won't have any mess so I'm going to start with to see how so when you're ready just relax you can close your eyes if it helps just focus on maybe the sound outside the room oh my voice the sound of the water and the water filling your ears okay deep breaths that's working beautifully remember this is the year that does the most in this one how does that feel good so that's cleared up quite a bit now let's try okay again I'll just fill up my syringe plus water here when you do again let's focus on the sound really well so coming out lovely yeah good yeah let me just have a little look inside see what we wanted to play there I'll check on this side okay my line to get here we go look looks very good okay that's what really well there's still look a bit left in there but most of its come out okay good right well we'll probably have to do this one again but very small amount next year oh yeah that's fantastic this is cleared out completely that's a really good job really please so I'm just going to have another go on this side just little bit to get it just take a tiny bit into the syringe not too much just look and then again use the glass and that's it it's coming out it's officially loose so that doesn't need a lot check that it should be fine see oh yes all done that's great that really has worked pleased with that excellent great and how does that feel can you hear me better good okay well all I need to do now is take some more cotton ball and I will remove any more debris from just along the outside anything that's fallen out I could see little bits already and I'll dry off your ears once that's done you're free to go okay some got balls here first of all I'm going to wet them just a little bit so that I can clean any residue again cleaning me outside when I flushed all debris that got stuck on the outside a few lives should be next I use to dry pieces of got more just here I'll just dry the outsides of your ears okay try the outside of your head any remaining water he's gone Hey I look just down your neck excellent great job he must feel good all right nice and dry excellent okay so that's it all done I'm glad you came in that's really good and also thank you for following our instructions and continuing to so curious for two weeks I know it's not easy but it's definitely worth doing so next time you feel the build you feel you need to raise cleaning again just okay all right well thank you so much for coming I'll see you again you
