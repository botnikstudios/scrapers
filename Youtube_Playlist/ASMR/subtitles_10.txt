right hey hi how are you it's good to see you the girls in the salon said that you're going to a wedding okay the evening reception right well what are you wearing ah sounds good okay well that would go really nice with your new hairstyle you would well in that case why don't we go for a 40 stock yeah well that would be um defined eyebrows and winged eyeliner with a smokey eye and red --let's yeah how does that sound okay I think that it would look perfect so are you ready okay ah my first question is did you cleanse your face thoroughly today you did did you scrub it hmm okay well all I have to do then is use my facial wipes to just remove the excess oil from your skin let's go so I just Oh with you forehead cheeks mine eyes and chin side there we are I'm just going to blow your skin just do try it quickly for me that's right so I'm going to start with some moisturizer and then I'll move on to you primer and that's because if you're going out all night wearing foundation if you have a good primer underneath it'll disturb a stop that's right so when the cameras on late at night you'll still look good I have some Aubrey organics green tea and ginkgo which is fantastic real skin it's a long natural just apply that to your forehead first cheeks maybe half-wits tour - he is right so let's move on to the primer I like to go for bare minerals primetime I find it's the most reliable and it feels so nice and silky on your skin you just need a very small amount and I just spread that do my fingers I won't will you rub it into your skin I will just glide it over the top just like and only on the forehead cheeks chin down you're okay you feel that it's so silky isn't it so we don't really rub it just gliding it over oh yeah I'm next I'm going to use some Mac Studio Fix foundation and orgo fluid normally for daytime I would suggest using Bare Minerals but for the evening we probably need something slightly more hard-wearing should we say so again just a little bit on the back of my hand I'm going to use this stippling brush it's not too big just small enough to fit into the creases I just distributed evenly around the brush and if I apply in very small circular movements around your face we will create the airbrush to look like that perfect all right so that's your foundation so let's move on to your eyebrows they look very tidy so I can tell you look after them so all I'm going to do is just define them a little bit by filling in spaces and brushing them out just to shape them alright and the other side so to film in I'm going to use a mic penultimate brow marker it's a bit like felt-tip pen actually but it's perfect just to and in the spaces between you eyelashes do define them and make them appear more for just small strokes to blend it in with your eye real and next I'm going to move on to eyeshadow and we're going to go for a smoky smoky eye as I said um first I will start with got this palette here it's a matte palette the base for your eyeshadow will be this one here I like to color and then fill the crease going to go for this very dark and blend it in to create your smoky eye this is the I'm filling you eyelet with this color I'm also going to just in the corners this widen your eyes makes your eyes appear nothing they're not bright or anything you have very beautiful eyes okay and for the crease I just left my brush here just press it into your crease because I want quite a dense color I have a blending brush here and fighters go in circular movements just around the edges of the dock to blend it that's how we get a smokey eye lovely and next we have our eyeliner and this one is black it's very fine perfect to achieve a nice thin line for the nice point on your wing so for mascara which is next I always go for benefit they're real not only because it's good mascara but because the brush just little bit on the end and that helps me to get right into the corners and cover all the eyelashes okay and the button scooters I think you're going to be happy okay before I move on to your lips I'm going to use some bronzer just to contour your face and brighten your complexion like so good to go down your nose and your cheeks and your forehead and your chin and for that I'm going to use my bare minerals this is the bonsai it's called warm finest works product just gosh -
