this was right a s hello this is Emma and today's video is hey tingle basket as you can see now we have something special on its way don't we Christmas so the theme for this video is Christmasy things I thought you might like it sounds Christmas before I start I would like to say Merry Christmas to everyone I hope it's everything you want it to be everything it can be for you mostly I hope that it's we have tinsel it's very nice it's sort of a purpley ready color nice deep mysterious snugly in the self and of course Wesley let's have a look what's inside tinkle basket some will know what this is and so on so I shall explain this here is a cracker it's something we can't do it out over in this country we have them on our table during Christmas dinner so it is a cardboard tube and it's twisted on either end and inside Oh lots of goodies and what you must do is hold one end and someone else you have a sitting next to you pause the other side and inside there is a and the person with the side that has this part wins okay and they win what is inside so I'm not going to pull it for his reasons but I'm going to open it and show you what's inside a cracker so traditionally the cracker is pulled before dinner because it always has something inside that we have to have before dinner start to meet your own openness for you quietly of course okay for a cracker it must contain two things otherwise it's not a proper cracker and the first thing is this this is a paper hat we call them paper everyone around the table has to wear their crown clips on the head like this they come in all colors and whichever hat you get you have to wear it no matter if it's not your color in fact if it looks silly that's good so the second thing that it must always contain ears this joke the joke in this cracker is how does Jack Frost get to work and the answer is by icicles and everyone laughs obviously and then there's a gift and depending on which home crackers you bought whether you bought the cheaper ones or whether you decide to splash out and buy some luxury perk is that all depends on what gift you get you see to be honest um most of the things you getting crackers you don't really keep anyway so the cheaper ones are one in this one we have mini playing cards which are quite handy for Christmas Day I have to say so that as far as gifts in Christmas crackers go that's not about one other gifts include um nail scissors they don't work mini tape measures they guide kid or a mini um magnifying glass stuff like that or probably the worst thing you can get in a cracker or for me anyway and especially as a child is a golf tee usually in every box of crackers there are a few properties I think I prefer the mini data measures you also get many rulers and stuff like that so there we are mini playing cards I can't so let's pop this book and see what else is in the Dinka basket now you've seen a cracker hmm very important this is a box of cadburys roses so regardless of how healthy you are throughout the year if you're not a chocolate person or a sweet person or a super healthy person when Christmas comes around you have to have a box or a tin of either roses or the other one is quality Street now if I was to meet someone for the first time and I wanted to judge their character I'd say are you roses person or are you a quality street person and they said quality Street I'd be a little bit wary of them I have to say because roses oh my favorite so so in roses you would have my favorite of all time and that is hazelnut in caramel and they come in a purple wrapper they're so nice but the trick is not to eat all of your favorites first because then you've got nothing else to look like to pop on your endurance I also like the golden barrel I like to bite into the chocolate open it and look at caramel and then eat the chocolate which is another nice one strawberry dream I'll open it and show you my favorite let's see looks like just one egg top or near the top so this is what it looks like purple and it says contains hazelnuts and milk so we twist open sides here open it this is what the hazelnut caramel looks like and it's like segments in shape hmm you can see the caramel inside okay that is hot here we have next these are Christmas baubles the tree they have the tunnel thousand they're heart-shaped and I particularly like these ones because they have some nice words on them they say love joy cozy ah Noel Merry Christmas whole nice worth these are glass or balls and they have these little glitter stars on them which a nice spray Dwight these will go on the tree kick very important stuff okay we have here two jars one is applesauce and the other is cranberry sauce both essentials for a good Christmas so I always buy a cranberry sauce to go with the Christmas dinner and sometimes someone might like some apple sauce with their dinner too but my main reason for having apple sauce yz4 cheese and biscuits on Boxing Day on Boxing Day all I have want to do you stay in pajamas and which films that's my favorite Boxing Day because Christmas Day is so busy with people to cooking tidying up so it's nice to just do nothing on Boxing Day stay in a onesie pajamas and I wait till about 2 o'clock in the afternoon to have my teeth and biscuits my favorite cheese is Lancashire cheese because that the county I'm from and it tastes delicious and creamy and crumbly I will have some pickles too some crackers and apple sauce I'll have a few different cheeses the 90 cities always must be one of those this year I have gone for Coleman's of Norwich he ready to use a poor condiment sauce Apple 69% sugar water pops and something I would buy all year round it's just a must cranberry sauce I'm serving suggestion here pair a DC roast chicken or your delicious Christmas turkey with the generous helping of common thread and fruity cranberry sauce hey where did T's cranberry condiment sauce I should really make this myself shouldn't I I did one year gates um to my friends damn it chutney as well stuff here simple shredded silver I love this top it's nice to finish off the tree and you just have to cut it here and drape it on the edges of the branches of your tree and they just add a little bit of sparkle then nice you can get them in all colors and I like silver so I went or silver this year I like it I saw something else just a moment ago not this this is little decoration of scented dried things there is a heart woven with twigs and cinnamon sticks orange and bay leaves it's scented with the same scent that was on the potpourri that I made the video with so it will be nice just to hang maybe by the front door so anyone coming here will be welcomed with the smell of Christmas think the added Toth the Bailey's is really nice and have some nice color to it and cinnamon sticks are sprayed in gold which is lovely day everything is attached together with a string of plastic and tied it's hard it's just ugly one last thing on the tingle basket something I spotted this is a packet of cinnamon it's specifically for decoration with extra made in the Netherlands actually so with this I will top up my potpourri to give it a boost very short sticks but some of them are wide decorous season decoration looks like we had the cracker and we had the roses and the bubbles I need decoration I'm very sore and hanging me and finally the cinema now we're going to put the tinkle basket away until the next time I hope you enjoyed it have a wonderful Christmas and a Happy New Year I'll see you saying goodbye good night stay well goodnight
