Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
Shred the onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain the juice and discard. Combine the onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper; mix the meat well with a spoon until mashed.
Divide the dough into two portions and lightly flour a work surface. Keep one piece of dough covered while you roll out the second portion into a rectangle, rolling the dough as thin as you can. Cut the rectangle into 2-inch squares with a knife or pastry wheel.
Place about 2 teaspoons of the meat filling in the center of each square. Seal the dumplings by gathering the edges of the dough and pinching them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer the finished manti to a floured plate, and sprinkle more flour over the manti to prevent sticking. Repeat with the second piece of dough.
Heat the oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until the pepper flakes have started to color the oil; don't let them burn. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Stir the minced garlic into the yogurt and set aside.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook the manti until the filling is no longer pink, and the dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well. Divide the manti among four plates. Spoon the yogurt sauce over the manti and drizzle each serving with the hot pepper oil.

Roasted Winter Squash (above)
1/2 cup half-and-half, if desired* (optional)
2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup Progresso® plain Panko crispy bread crumbs, toasted light brown in saute pan over medium heat


To make roasted winter squash: Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Heat butter over medium-high heat in an ovenproof saute pan; add diced squash, salt and pepper. When squash begins to brown, place pan in oven. Roast for 15 minutes or until medium-brown on all sides. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Puree in food processor, or mash with potato masher or ricer. Measure 1 1/2 cups squash; reserve.
To make soup: Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the onion, celery, carrot and cinnamon stick; saute until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the broth and the coriander; bring to a boil. Simmer for several minutes. Stir in reserved squash until smooth; simmer gently to let the flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick.
Puree the soup using an immersion blender or in a blender until smooth. (The soup can be made ahead to this point, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for several days or frozen for about 1 month. It will thicken as it cools and may need thinning with broth or water when reheating.)
Return the soup to the pan and reheat gently. Add the half-and-half. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Top each serving with pumpkin seeds and toasted bread crumbs.

1/4 cup dried currants
1/4 cup rum, or as needed to cover currants
3/4 cup milk, warmed to 100 degrees F/40 degrees C
3 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
5 tablespoons white sugar
1 large egg, beaten
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
7 tablespoons melted butter
Crosses:
1/4 cup water
1/3 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed to make thin, pipe-able dough
Glaze:
1/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoons water


Place currants in a small bowl. Heat rum until steaming in a small pan and pour over currants to soften them, about 2 hours. Drain; reserve liquid for another use.
Whisk warm milk, 1/4 cup flour, and yeast together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Let sit about 15 minutes to ensure yeast is active; small bubbles should start to rise to the surface. Add sugar, beaten egg, lemon and orange zest, cinnamon, salt, cardamom, nutmeg, melted butter, and most of the remaining flour (you might not need it all). Mix with a dough hook attachment until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and becomes slightly elastic, 5 or 6 minutes. Continue kneading until dough is soft and shiny, about 10 minutes. Remove dough from dough hook and shape into a ball. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface.
Flatten dough into a large oval about 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle currants evenly over surface of dough. Fold dough into thirds. Turn and fold into thirds again. Reshape dough into a round ball. Transfer to lightly oiled mixing bowl. Cover and let rise in a relatively warm, draft-free place until double in size, about 2 hours.
Poke dough down a bit with your fingertips. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Flatten out dough into an even shape. Divide into 16 equal pieces using a bench scraper.
Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat.
Roll each piece of dough into a round ball. Arrange evenly on prepared baking sheet. Let rise 15 minutes.
Mix 1/4 cup water and 1/3 cup flour together in a mixing bowl until mixture is thick enough to hold its shape but thin enough to pipe. Transfer mixture to a piping bag.
After buns have risen 15 minutes, pipe a cross on top of each. Let rise until doubled from original dough balls, another 15 or 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Transfer pan to preheated oven. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Combine 1/4 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a pan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until sugar dissolves and mixture starts to thicken, or until it reaches a temperature of 225 degrees F. Remove from heat.
Let buns cool on a rack for 5 minutes before glazing. Brush glaze lightly over the tops of the buns.

Coarsely grind caraway seeds with salt  with a mortar and pestle.  Mash the garlic into a paste with the caraway.  In a large bowl, whisk together the garlic paste with the honey, lemon juice, and olive oil.  Season with paprika, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper; mix well.
Lightly oil the inside of a heavy, ovenproof Dutch oven.  Add the zucchini, turnips, red pepper, yellow squash, and onions.  Toss with 1/2 of the spice paste.  Stir in tomatoes and chicken broth.  Toss the Cornish hens with the remaining spice paste, then arrange them in the Dutch oven, so that the cut side is facing down.
Cover the Dutch oven, and bake in the center of the preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  If a crunchy skin is desired on the Cornish hens, uncover during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Skim the fat off of the broth.
Serve hens on top of vegetables, spoon some of the broth over, and sprinkle with the parsley, cilantro, and mint.

Dough:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
1/2 cup instant potato flakes
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 eggs
6 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup margarine, softened
Filling:
1/3 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup raisins (optional)
Glaze:
1 1/2 cups unsifted confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons warm water, or as needed


Prepare the dough by sprinkling the yeast onto 1/4 cup of warm water; set aside to soften for 5 minutes. Stir the potato flakes, milk, 1/2 cup water, white sugar, and salt together in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture reaches 110 degrees F (63 degrees C). Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth, then whisk in the warm milk mixture and yeast. Stir in the flour and margarine until a dough forms. Turn out onto a floured work surface, and knead until smooth and satiny, 10 to 20 minutes.
Place the dough into a greased bowl, and turn over to grease both sides of the dough. Cover, and set in a warm spot to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, and knead again briefly to push out the air. Cover, and let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir 1/3 cup softened butter with the brown sugar and ground cinnamon until blended. Feel free to make extra if you like more filling in your cinnamon rolls.
Once the dough has rested, turn onto a floured surface and divide in two. Stretch and roll one half into a 10x14-inch rectangle. Spread half of the cinnamon filling onto the dough, and sprinkle with half of the raisins. Roll up the dough from the narrow end, and pinch the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Grease two baking sheets, and cut each roll into 12 pieces. Arrange the cinnamon rolls onto the prepared baking sheets. Cover, and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake the cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool. Prepare the glaze by stirring the confectioners' sugar with 1 tablespoon butter, vanilla extract, and 2 tablespoons warm water until smooth. Use additional water if needed to make a pourable glaze. Pour the glaze over the cinnamon rolls while still warm.

Ravioli Dough:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons water
Ravioli Filling:
1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce
2 cups heavy cream
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce
Egg Wash:
1 egg
1 tablespoon water


Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.
Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.
Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.
Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.
Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.
To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.

Dough:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
3/4 cup hot water
2 tablespoons butter at room temperature
Filling:
2 1/2 cups apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Glaze:
2 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 teaspoons milk


Combine 1 cup flour, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and instant yeast in a mixing bowl. Add the water and room temperature butter and beat for 1 minute. Stir in the remaining cup of flour and mix well. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to an oiled bowl, turning to coat the surface of the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, make the filling. Place the chopped apples and 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan. Combine 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix well; add the mixture to the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the apples are tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow the filling to cool.
Transfer the Danish dough to a floured surface and punch the dough down. Let the dough rest, covered, for 15 minutes. Roll the dough out into a 13 x 8-inch rectangle. Place the dough on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
Turn the baking sheet so that you face the short side of the dough. Spread the apple filling down the center third of the dough. With a sharp paring knife, make cuts in the dough along the right side, starting each cut about 1/4 inch from the apple filling. Cut to the edge of the dough strip, with each cut angled to about 4 o'clock. Each strip of dough should be about 1-inch thick. Repeat on the left side of the dough, angling the cuts to 8 o'clock.
Starting at the top, fold the dough strips across the apple filling, alternating left and right. The pastry will look like a long braid. Pinch the top and bottom ends of the braid to seal in the filling. Cover the pastry and let it rise at room temperature until the dough is puffy, 30 to 40 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake the braid for 20 minutes, covering it with aluminum foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to prevent over-browning. Remove the pastry from the oven and allow it to cool.
To make the glaze, heat the 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Swirl the pan occasionally and cook until the milk solids turn brown and give off a nutty fragrance, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl to cool slightly. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Mix in the milk a teaspoon at a time until the glaze is thin enough to drizzle. Decorate the Danish braid with the glaze.

1 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
freshly ground black pepper to taste


Mix together brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, mustard powder, onion powder, and pepper in a bowl until well blended. Makes enough rub to cover one 3 to 5 pound ham. To be sure sugars form a crust, do not cover the ham during cooking. If not using immediately, store in an airtight tin.


4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup warm water
2 cups warm milk
6 tablespoons vegetable shortening
2 eggs
6 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup baking soda
4 cups water
1/4 cup melted butter
sea salt


Sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar over 1/2 cup of warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
Add milk, shortening, eggs, oil, 3 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Blend with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Mix in remaining 3 cups of flour by hand, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. The dough will be sticky.
Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Uncover the dough and punch it down.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pull off baseball size portions of dough and roll into "snakes" about 6 inches long. Roll each "snake" into a spiral to give the tops some texture. Set each formed bun aside.
Mix the baking soda and 4 cups hot water in a bowl. The baking soda does not need to dissolve completely. Dip each bun in the baking soda solution before placing on a baking sheet. Brush each bun with melted butter and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake in the preheated oven until brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack or brown paper bag.

For the Dough
5 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, cubed
3 egg yolks
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
4 cups self-rising flour
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
For the Filling
1 cup whole milk
1 cup white sugar
2 1/2 cups finely chopped walnuts
1 lemon, zested
2/3 cup golden raisins
1 egg
1 tablespoon water


Combine the 5 tablespoons sugar, butter, egg yolks, and sour cream in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade and process well. Add the flour and yeast and process until the dough comes together. If the dough feels too wet, add a little more flour; if it's too dry, add milk a tablespoon at a time. The dough should be moist and easy to work with.
Shape the dough into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and set aside. To make the filling, heat the milk and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves and the mixture has a syrupy consistency. Add the chopped walnuts and stir to combine. Remove the saucepan from the heat; stir in the lemon zest and raisins, and let filling cool.
Divide the dough into three pieces. Roll one piece of dough out on a lightly floured surface to form a long rectangle about a 1/4-inch thick; keep the remaining dough covered. Spread 1/3 of the walnut filling on the dough, leaving about an inch of dough at each edge. Roll the dough up to form a log, and press to seal. Place the dough, seam-side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Brush the loaves with egg wash and let rest for 1 hour in a warm place. After the dough has risen, brush it again with egg wash and put the baking tray in the refrigerator for 30 minutes (this will give the dough a shiny finish).
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake the loaves until they're a deep golden brown, about 35 to 45 minutes.

2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon GOYA® Adobo All-Purpose Seasoning with Pepper
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon packed dark brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons GOYA® Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin roast


Heat oven to 450 degrees F. In small bowl, mix together chili powder, Adobo, cumin, dark brown sugar and cinnamon until well combined. Stir olive oil into Adobo mixture until completely saturated.
Using paper towels, pat pork loin dry. Rub pork all over with Adobo mixture. Transfer pork to foil-lined roasting pan. Cook until pork is dark golden brown and instant-read thermometer registers 145 degrees F when inserted into center of loin, about 35 minutes.
Transfer pork to platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Let rest 10-15 minutes before slicing. Serve with accumulated juices.


5 cups bread flour
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 cups water, or as needed
2 cups unsalted butter, at room temperature


Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer that is fitted with a dough hook. Gradually stir in water until the dough holds together enough to clean the sides of the bowl. You may not need the full amount of water. Shape into a flat ball, and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes.
Place the butter between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound into a flat disc using a rolling pin or other heavy object. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a large rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Place the disc of chilled butter in the center and fold the two ends over it so that it is completely encased in dough. Roll out the dough again, taking care not to let the butter break through the dough, to about 1/2 inch thickness. Fold into thirds. This is the first ''turn''.  Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll out into a rectangle again. Fold into thirds. By this time the butter is starting to warm up. Place the dough on a baking sheet and mark it with two pokes from your finger (two turns). Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Repeat this rolling, folding and turning two more times, then refrigerate until firm. Repeat two more times for a total of 6 ''turns''. Wrap and refrigerate. The dough is now ready to roll out and use in any recipe calling for puff pastry. Roll the dough out as thin as 1/4 inch to make pastries. Bake in a preheated oven of at least 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) to get the maximum puff from your pastry.

1/2 pound ground lamb
1/2 cup uncooked long grain rice
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon dried currants
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 large egg
1 (16 ounce) jar grape leaves
1 tablespoon olive oil
juice of one lemon
4 cups hot chicken broth
2 teaspoons olive oil, or as desired


Place ground lamb, rice, 1/4 cups olive oil, mint, currants, pine nuts, salt, pepper, cumin, cinnamon, oregano, and egg in a bowl. Mix together thoroughly with a fork. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Gently unroll and separate grape leaves. Rinse in cold water to remove brine. Drain. Reserve broken or less-than-perfect leaves to line pot.
Place grape leaves on work surface with smooth side down (ribs of leaves up). Place a rounded tablespoon of lamb-rice filling near bottom-center of grape leaf. Fold bottom sections of leaf over mixture, fold over sides, and roll toward the top of the leaf into a firm cylinder. Don't roll too tightly or leaves may burst when rice cooks.
Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil into pot; line bottom of pot with 1 or 2 layers of reserved grape leaves. Place dolmas in pot by arranging them along the sides, then working toward the center to cover the bottom. Leave enough space between dolmas to allow for expansion, but close enough to hold their shapes when cooking. If necessary, stack another layer on top of the first so they all fit. Pour in lemon juice and 2 teaspoons olive oil.
Invert a small plate and then a larger plate over the dolmas to weigh them down while they cook and prevent them from shifting. Pour in hot chicken broth. Bring to a simmer, uncovered, over medium-high heat. As soon as liquid is heated through and starting to bubble (2 to 4 minutes), reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and cook 35 minutes. Remove plates and check for doneness. Dolmas should look a bit puffed up, and a fork should pierce them easily. If not quite done, continue cooking without the weights: cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
Serve warm or chilled. Garnish with curls of lemon zest, if desired.

3 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 drop red food coloring (optional)
1/4 cup finely chopped pecans
Lemon Filling:
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup boiling water
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
2 tablespoons butter, room temperature
2 tablespoons lemon zest
6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 egg whites
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup heavy cream, chilled
1/4 cup shaved sweet chocolate


Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
To make the chocolate crust, combine the flour, hot cocoa mix, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in the shortening with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the milk, vanilla, and food coloring and toss with a fork until the flour mixture is moistened. Roll the crust out between two sheets of waxed paper and transfer it to a 9-inch pie pan. Trim or crimp the edges. Prick the bottom and sides of the crust with a fork and sprinkle with chopped pecans.

To make the filling, mix the cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 cup sugar together in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in the boiling water. Heat the mixture over high heat until the mixture boils. Reduce the heat and simmer until the filling is thick and clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Gradually whisk a portion of the hot filling into the beaten egg yolks. Return the yolk mixture to the saucepan and cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly.
Stir in the rehydrated gelatin mixture and mix until dissolved. Blend in the butter, lemon zest, and lemon juice; remove from heat.
Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Gradually add the 3 tablespoons sugar, continuing to beat until medium-stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the egg whites should curl over slightly.
Use a rubber spatula or wire whisk to fold 1/3 of the beaten egg whites (meringue) into the hot filling mixture. Gently run the spatula through the center of the bowl, then around the sides of the bowl, repeating until fully incorporated. Add the remaining meringue, folding just until incorporated. Allow the mixture to cool for 25 minutes; the filling should mound from a spoon when dropped back into the bowl.
Whip the cream until stiff. Fold the whipped cream into the filling and gently spread the filling in the cooled baked pie shell. Sprinkle the pie with the chocolate shavings and refrigerate until serving.

6 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup Bulgarian-style buttermilk
1/4 cup all-purpose flour (optional)
Cream cheese filling:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese at room temperature
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Egg wash:
1 egg
1/4 cup water
Icing:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
4 teaspoons corn syrup
4 teaspoons milk
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or as needed


Mix 4 cups of flour, white sugar, yeast, and salt together in the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.
Whisk 3 eggs in a separate bowl. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat and whisk buttermilk into melted butter; heat until an instant-read thermometer reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). Whisk buttermilk mixture into beaten eggs and cool the mixture to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).
Beat egg mixture into flour mixture on medium-low speed to make a firm, elastic dough, about 10 minutes. If dough doesn't separate from the sides of the mixing bowl during kneading, beat in 1/4 cup more flour.
Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead for 1 minute; form into a ball and place into a buttered bowl, turning dough around to lightly coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the outer edge of an 8-inch cake pan.
Stir cream cheese, 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and nutmeg in a bowl until filling is smooth.
Punch down dough and turn out onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper. Roll dough into a 10x28-inch rectangle. Spread cream cheese filling over the rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border along each edge. Lift an edge of the parchment paper sheet to roll dough into a log shape, starting at a 28-inch edge. Pinch seams closed to seal in filling, keeping roll on the parchment paper.
Wrap the filled dough around the outside of the buttered 8-inch cake pan to form the dough into a ring; pinch the edges closed. Use parchment paper to lift the cake and cake pan and slide a baking sheet beneath the parchment. Gently free cake pan, leaving the ring-shaped cake.

In a large bowl, combine milk, pumpkin, sugar, butter, salt, yeast and 2 cups flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Divide the dough into four equal pieces, divide each of these pieces into four pieces and then divide each of these 16 pieces in half to make 32 pieces. Form each piece into a round and place on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

For the Fondant:
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
4 1/2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
For the Sponge:
3/4 cup milk, room temperature, divided
1 1/2 (0.6 ounce) cakes cake yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup unbleached flour
For the Dough:
3 cups unbleached flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 pinch salt
2 eggs, room temperature
zest from 1 lemon
3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature and cut into chunks
1/2 cup ground almonds
For the Filling:
3/4 cup milk
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/3 cup white sugar
2 1/2 cups poppy seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 egg, room temperature


First, make the fondant. It needs to be refrigerated overnight before using. To make the fondant, you'll need a marble slab or a baking sheet and an offset spatula to fold the candy. If you're using a baking sheet, rinse it with water, leaving a few drops on the pan.
Dissolve the cream of tarter in the water in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Swirl the pan occasionally to help dissolve the sugar. Do not stir once the sugar syrup begins to boil. Heat to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Immediately pour the candy onto the baking sheet or marble slab and let cool for 10 minutes. Use a spatula to vigorously knead the candy, folding it over itself. Knead until it begins to look cloudy, 5 to 10 minutes; allow it to cool. Transfer the fondant to a heatproof bowl or the top of a double boiler. Refrigerate overnight.
To make the sponge, dissolve the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/4 cup of the room-temperature milk. Pour the remaining 1/2 cup milk into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 1 cup of flour and the yeast mixture. Mix with a fork to combine. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow to rest until bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir the remaining 3 cups of flour, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, room-temperature eggs, and zest from 1 lemon into the sponge. Use the dough hook to mix the dough on the lowest setting. Mix the dough for about 5 minutes, occasionally scraping the dough off of the hook and down the sides of the bowl.
Increase the speed to medium-low and add the softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time until fully incorporated. Allow the dough to mix for an additional  5 minutes, scraping the dough down as needed. Add the ground almonds and turn the mixer on for 1 or 2 turns, mixing just until incorporated. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a ball. Place the ball in an oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let it rise until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Heat the milk in a heavy 4-quart saucepan until it begins to boil; stir in the butter and sugar. Remove the pan from the heat and add the poppyseeds, 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon zest, and the cinnamon. Let the mixture stand for 30 minutes to soften the poppyseeds. When the mixture is cool, whisk in the egg.
Punch down the dough and roll it out into a 10 1/2- by 16-inch rectangle. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch margin on all sides. Roll the dough up into a log, starting with the long side, and pinch the edges together to form a seam. Place the loaf, seam-side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover it with greased plastic wrap or a well-floured kitchen towel and allow it to rise for an additional 30 to 40 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake the stollen until golden brown on the bottom of the loaf, about 40 minutes. Let the bread cool completely before glazing.
To glaze the bread, add the lemon juice to the fondant. Place the bowl  over a pan of  simmering water, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula until soft and glossy. Pour the fondant over the stollen and allow it to cool before slicing.


1 1/8 cups castor sugar or superfine sugar, divided
3/4 cup sifted cake flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
9 egg whites
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting
1 cup white sugar
2 1/3 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
6 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar (optional)


Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan with cooking spray. Line with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of superfine sugar, cake flour and salt. Set aside. In a separate bowl, whip egg whites until foamy. Add vanilla and cream of tartar, and continue to whip. Gradually sprinkle in the remaining superfine sugar while continuing to whip the egg whites to firm peaks. Sift the flour mixture over the egg whites and fold in by hand using a rubber spatula. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the center of the cake springs back when lightly pressed. Cool in the pan over a wire rack. Generously sift sugar over the top of the cake, and cover with a clean towel. Run a spatula around the outside of the cake in the pan to loosen, and turn out onto the towel. Remove the parchment paper from the back of the cake, then place it back on loosely. Roll up with the towel loosely from short end to short end, and allow to cool in the rolled position.
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 1 cup of white sugar, cranberries and water. Simmer until the cranberries burst, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the cornstarch, and simmer just until thick, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.
Unroll the cake so that it is sitting flat on the towel. Spread the cooled cranberry filling over the top, leaving 1/2 inch border. Use the towel to help you keep a grip on the cake for an even roll. Roll up from short end to short end and place seam side down onto a platter. Refrigerate until serving.
Whip cream with confectioners' sugar until soft peaks form. Serve slices of cake with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream.


3/4 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup molasses

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until cookies have spread and tops have cracked.  Let cool on wire rack.


1 1/3 cups strong brewed coffee, room temperature
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup dark molasses
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup rye flour
2 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast or bread machine yeast


Place all ingredients in bread machine pan in order suggested by manufacturer. Select Dough cycle. When the machine indicates the end of the final rise, remove the dough.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Shape the dough into 12 dinner rolls, or one 9x5 inch loaf. Let rise until doubled in size while the oven preheats, they should rise quickly.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven for rolls, or 35  minutes for a loaf, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.


2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, at room temperature
4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons sugar
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/4 cup lukewarm water
1 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 egg
1 tablespoon water


Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour over the butter and mix it together with your hands in a mixing bowl or on a work surface. Transfer the butter to a length of foil or parchment paper and pat it into a 6 inch square. Fold up the foil to make a packet and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.
Combine 2 cups of the flour with the salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C) and set aside until frothy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, warm the milk and the heavy cream to lukewarm. Add the yeast, milk, and cream to the flour mixture and stir well. The dough will have a batter-like consistency.
Stir in the remaining 2 cups of flour 1/4 cup at a time to form a soft dough. It should no longer be sticky. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Place the dough in a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
To begin the rolling and folding process, both the butter and the dough should be at a cool room temperature. [See Cook's Note.] Place the dough on a floured surface and roll it into a 10-inch square. Set the block of butter diagonally on the square dough. Bring each point of dough to the center of the butter square; the edges of the dough should overlap. Pinch the edges together to seal.
Starting from the center of the square and working outward, use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle. The butter should be pliable enough to roll smoothly with the dough; if it's too soft and starts to ooze out the corners, wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate before proceeding. Roll the dough into a long rectangle, approximately 8 by 18 inches. Fold the length of dough into thirds, like a business letter.
If the dough is still cool, you can continue with another fold. Otherwise, wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it warm up for about 10 minutes before you begin rolling it out again.
Position the dough so that the open ends are at 12 and 6 o'clock.  Roll the dough into a rectangle, working from the center of the dough and pressing outwards. Reposition the dough as necessary to fit your work space. You should have a long rectangle for the "book fold." Fold both ends of the dough into the middle; the ends don't have to be touching, but should be close. Fold the already-folded dough in half; it will look like a thick book. Wrap the dough well with plastic and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Roll the dough into a rectangle again and fold it into thirds, like a business letter. Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 4-6 hours or overnight.
To shape the croissants, roll the dough into a 10- by 38-inch rectangle on a lightly floured work surface. It should be about 1/4 inch thick. Use a pizza wheel or sharp paring knife to trim the edges of the dough. Divide the rectangle in half so that you have two 5-inch wide strips of dough. Use a clean yardstick to mark each strip into triangles that are 5 inches wide at their bases. Cut the triangles and place them onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Chill for 15 to 20 minutes, if necessary.
Starting at the base of the triangle, roll the dough up into a log; the tip of the triangle should be under the body of the croissant to prevent it from unraveling. Bend in the corners to form the traditional crescent shape. Repeat with the remaining dough.
Arrange the croissants on the parchment-lined baking sheets and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash. Brush the croissants with egg wash and bake in the preheated oven until deep brown, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool on a rack before serving.

1 tablespoon yellow colored sugar, or as needed


Place the warm water, salt, softened butter, egg, sour cream, 3 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, flour, and yeast into a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer, select the dough cycle, and start the machine. Check the dough after about 5 minutes of mixing, and add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of water or flour if the dough is too dry or wet.
Mix 1/4 cup of sugar, the cinnamon, and 2 1/2 tablespoons of melted butter together in a bowl. Grease a baking sheet, and set aside.
When the dough cycle is finished, remove the dough and roll out to a 10x28-inch rectangle on a floured surface. Spread the cinnamon-butter mixture over the dough, and sprinkle on an even layer of pecans. Pick up one of the long edges, and roll the dough into a 28-inch long log. Place the rolled dough onto the prepared baking sheet, seam side down, and form the dough into a ring. Moisten the ends of the dough with a little water; pinch the two ends together to seal. Cover the dough ring with a cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake the cake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Mix the confectioners' sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons of melted butter, vanilla extract, and just enough milk to make a smooth but not thin glaze.
Remove the cake from the oven, and cool for about 10 minutes on a wire rack. While the cake is still warm, spoon the glaze onto the cake, allowing drips of glaze to dribble down the sides of the cake. Immediately sprinkle the cake with alternating bands of purple, green, and yellow colored sugar. Allow the cake to cool completely before serving.

For the Pilaf:
2 tablespoons butter
2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1/2 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
1 cup chicken broth
salt and pepper to taste
Sauce:
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup butter
4 ounces button mushrooms, quartered
1 1/2 cups finely chopped onion
1 teaspoon fresh-squeezed lemon juice
2 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
12 cabbage leaves
6 (4 ounce) salmon fillets, skin removed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (17.25 ounce) packages frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 egg
1 tablespoon water


To make the rice pilaf, heat 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 2 1/2 tablespoons of  onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with butter. Pour in 1 cup chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is fluffy and all of the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set the rice aside.
For sauce, melt 1/4 cup of butter in a saucepan over medium heat until a pinch of flour sprinkled into the butter will just begin to bubble. Whisk in the flour to form a thick paste the consistency of cake frosting. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the flour has turned golden, and begins to smell like toasted bread, about 20 minutes. Whisk in 2 cups chicken broth and simmer until thickened and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Pour the sauce into the rice pilaf, reserving about 1/4 of it for serving, if desired.
Heat another 1/4 cup of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the mushrooms and cook until soft, about 5 minutes; add the 1 1/2 cups onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 8 minutes. Combine the onions and mushrooms with the rice mixture and allow it to cool slightly. Stir in the lemon juice, chopped hard-cooked eggs, and fresh dill.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with buttered parchment paper.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the cabbage leaves and cook, uncovered, until softened, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Once the leaves are cold, drain well, and blot dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a 1/4-inch thickness. Cut the pastry into 6 rectangular shapes; they should be three times wider than the salmon fillets, and 2 inches longer. Lay 2 cabbage leaves on each rectangle and top each with a spoonful of the rice mixture. Place each fillet "skin-side" up on top of the rice, and season with salt and black pepper. Top the fillets with another spoonful of rice; fold the cabbage leaves over the fillets to encase them. Center the folded leaves on the puff pastry.
Fold the short ends of the pastry in, and then the sides together to make a packet; pinch along the seams to seal.  Place the pastries onto the parchment-lined baking sheet seam sides down. Cut a small slit in the center of each pastry to act as a steam vent. Beat the egg and 1 tablespoon water together in a bowl; brush the pastries with the egg wash.
Bake in the preheated oven until the pastries are deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. The internal temperature of the salmon should reach 135 degrees F (57 degrees C).

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons cold water
Filling:
1/2 pound sweet Italian sausage
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 pounds ricotta cheese
1/2 pound shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
8 thin slices deli ham
1 cup sliced pepperoni
6 hard-cooked eggs, sliced
1 cup salami, cubed
2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled to lukewarm


Prepare the pastry: combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir in 3 beaten eggs, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and the cold water, and mix just until combined. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the Italian sausage. Cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Cool.
Divide the pastry into two unequal pieces, about one-third and two-thirds. Roll the small piece out on a lightly floured surface. Trace the bottom of a springform pan to make a 9-inch circle; keep any scraps of dough. Transfer the circle of dough to a plate or baking sheet and refrigerate. Roll out the larger piece of dough and any leftover scraps into a large circle about 1/4-inch thick. Carefully fold the dough in half and transfer it to a 9-inch springform pan. Let the weight of the dough sink down into the sides of the pan; gently press the dough into the bottom edges. Use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to trim the dough to have a 1-inch overhang. Refrigerate while you assemble the filling.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 3 beaten eggs, the ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses, and the chopped parsley in a bowl and mix well.
Layer the filling in the pastry-lined springform pan. Place 4 slices of ham, half the pepperoni, and half of the hard-cooked egg slices in the bottom of the pan. Top with half of the cubed salami and half of the cooked Italian sausage. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Repeat the layers.
Top the filled torta with the chilled round of pastry. Fold the edges over and crimp the crust to seal. Brush the pastry with the melted butter and bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is a deep golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool at least 15 minutes before slicing.

1 cup milk, room temperature
2 eggs, room temperature
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour (such as King Arthur®)
3 1/2 cups bread flour
1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper (optional)
1/4 cup butter, room temperature
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
Flexible plastic lids, for stencils
1/4 cup light rye flour, or as needed (optional)


Whisk milk and 2 eggs together in the bowl of a stand mixer; add pumpkin puree and honey and continue to stir until smooth.
Add white whole wheat flour, bread flour, yeast, salt, and white pepper to the pumpkin mixture. Attach the dough hook to the stand mixture and mix on low speed with the dough hook for 5 minutes, using a bowl scraper or stiff spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice. Increase speed to medium-low. Add butter one piece at a time, mixing until each piece is completely incorporated before adding the next.
Transfer the dough to a greased bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature until dough has doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
While the dough rises, draw designs with permanent marker onto a flexible plastic lid. Cut shapes with a sharp paring knife or X-ACTO® knife. Wash the lids with warm soapy water to remove any remaining ink.
Punch the dough down and fold it over to expel air bubbles. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until approximately 2 hours before you wish to serve the rolls.
Remove dough from the refrigerator and scrape from bowl onto a flour-dusted work surface. Divide the dough into 12 evenly sized pieces and shape into tight balls. Line 2 baking sheets with baking parchment; arrange balls seam-side down onto prepared sheets. (You can also freeze the dough at this point. Refer to footnotes for tips for freezing.)
Cover rolls with greased plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat 1 egg and water together in a small bowl using a whisk.
Grease your hands and use them to gently flatten the dough balls into flat rounds, about 1/2 inch thick. Brush egg wash over the top of each round.
Set a fine mesh strainer on a plate. Pour rye flour into the strainer. Place a stencil over one of the rounds. Sift rye flour onto the stencil. Carefully lift the stencil off the roll. Knock extra flour off stencil and onto the plate. Repeat with remaining rolls.
Let dough rounds stand at room temperature until risen fully, about 10 minutes. Test for readiness by dabbing your index finger in flour and pressing it gently into the side of a roll, if the indentation springs back, let the dough rise until risen enough so another such indentation stays, about 5 minutes more.
Bake rolls in preheated oven until tops are golden and bottoms are browned, 15 to 20 minutes.


1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the milk mixture. Add the sugar, 3 cups of flour, salt and eggs; stir well to combine. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.
Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 10x 14 inch rectangle. Lightly brush the far edge with water. In a small bowl combine the cinnamon and 3/4 cup brown sugar and sprinkle over the rectangles. Then sprinkle the raisins and chopped nuts over the dough. Roll up the dough into a log and seal the seam.
Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces; place the pieces in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan, or 12 inch deep dish pizza pan. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to rise overnight.
The next morning, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Take the rolls out of the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt
19 ounces bread flour


Place yeast and warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer; whisk to mix. Add flour and salt.
Knead with dough hook until mixture forms a soft, sticky dough ball and easily pulls away from the sides and the hook, about 5 minutes. (If still too sticky, add a bit more flour and knead a few more seconds.) Transfer dough to a work surface and form into a smooth ball. Place dough back in the mixing bowl. Drizzle the dough and sides of bowl a few drops of vegetable oil. Spread a film of oil over the surface of the dough.
Cover the bowl and transfer to a warm, draft-free place until dough is doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes.
Transfer dough to a floured work surface. Form into a rectangle shape and cut into 6 equal pieces. Using your cupped hand and the work surface, roll each section of dough into a smooth round ball. Cover with a clean, dry cloth and let rest 15 minutes.
Flatten dough balls into 6- or 7-inch long ovals. Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a cylinder, applying extra pressure to the ends to form pointy tips for a classic French roll shape. Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets (do not crowd them) and cover with clean dry towels until doubled, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place a pan of water on the bottom rack.
With a very sharp knife, score each roll about 1/4 inch deep along one side somewhere between the side and the top. Spritz loaves lightly with water from a spray bottle.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Punch down the dough, and roll it out to a rectangle shape on a floured work surface until it measures about 18 inches wide and 26 inches long. Brush the dough with 1/4 cup melted butter. Mix the brown sugar with 2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice in a small bowl, and sprinkle the mixture evenly over the dough. Roll up the dough the long way, and pinch the seam closed, then cut the dough into 12 equal-sized pieces with a sharp knife. Lay the rolls into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.
While the rolls are baking, mix vanilla extract, cream cheese, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, confectioners' sugar, and milk together to make a glaze. Spread the glaze over the rolls as soon as they come out of the oven.


1 (0.6 ounce) cake compressed fresh yeast
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
3 eggs
5 1/2 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened


Crumble the compressed yeast into a small bowl, and mix in 2 teaspoons of sugar. Set aside. In a small saucepan, heat milk until a skin forms on the top. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool slightly.
Place 1 cup of butter and remaining 1/2 cup of sugar into a large bowl. Pour the hot milk over them, and stir until butter is melted. Let the mixture cool to just above body temperature. Beat in the eggs, one at a time mixing well after each one, then stir in the yeast mixture. Add 3 cups of flour, and mix until well blended. Gradually mix in the remaining flour, mixing as well as you can. The dough will be sticky. Cover the bowl with a towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
After the dough has risen, punch down, cover, and refrigerate overnight.
Divide the dough into four pieces. Use one piece at a time, leaving the rest in the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll the piece of dough out into a 12 inch circle. Spread about 2 tablespoons of butter over the surface. Cut into 8 wedges, as you would a pizza. Roll each wedge starting at the wide end, and ending at the point. Place onto a lightly greased cookie sheet, and bend the ends so that they are crescent shaped. Cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled. This will take about 2 hours because the dough is cold.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden.

1 cup milk
4 large eggs
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
12 slices bacon
3 tablespoons butter, or as needed - divided
6 firm bananas, sliced in half lengthwise
12 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®), divided
12 tablespoons peanut butter, divided
1/2 tablespoon honey, divided
1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar for dusting, or as needed
1 tablespoon chocolate syrup, or as needed


Blend milk, eggs, 1 tablespoon melted butter, white sugar, almond extract, and flour in a blender into a smooth batter, 1 to 2 minutes. Allow the batter to rest while you finish the remaining steps, at least 20 minutes.
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter on a crepe pan or in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour in 1/4 cup of batter, swirl the pan to evenly coat the entire bottom of the pan with the thin batter, and cook until small brown spots appear on the bottom of the crepe, 2 to 3 minutes.
Carefully loosen crepe from the pan and gently flip to cook other side, 1 to 2 more minutes. Crepe is done when the batter in the center is set and a few small brown spots appear on the 2nd side.
Slide crepe onto a plate lined with a piece of parchment paper. Cook remaining crepes, buttering the pan when needed, and stack cooked crepes between pieces of parchment paper.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet and cook the sliced bananas until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Set bananas aside.
To assemble, place a crepe onto a serving plate and spread 1 tablespoon of chocolate hazelnut spread and 1 tablespoon peanut butter over the crepe.
Place a bacon strip in the center of the crepe and top bacon with a banana half. Drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon of honey over the banana half.
Roll up the crepe into a cylinder shape; dust with confectioners' sugar and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 12 filled crepes.


2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar

1 cup chicken broth
1 pound zucchini blossoms, rinsed and chopped
1 large tomato, seeded and diced
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh epazote leaves (optional)
1 (8 ounce) container creme fraiche
salt and black pepper to taste
2 cups half-and-half cream
1 cup grated Manchego cheese


Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the eggs, milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt, melted butter, and flour into a blender. Blend until no dry lumps of flour remain in the batter. Scrape down the sides of the blender as needed. Heat an oiled, non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour in enough batter to cover half of the skillet. Tip and rotate the skillet until the batter covers the entire area. Cook until the batter turns from wet to moist, and the edges begin to curl away from the sides of the skillet. Turn the crepe over, and continue cooking until lightly golden on the other side. Place the crepe onto a plate, and cover with a kitchen towel to keep moist. Repeat with the remaining batter, lightly oiling the skillet as needed to keep the crepes from sticking.
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, and simmer until reduced to half its original volume. Stir in the chopped zucchini blossoms, cover, and cook a few minutes until the squash blossoms have softened and reduced in volume. Stir in the tomato, nutmeg, and epazote until the tomato begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the creme fraiche, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
Roll about 2 tablespoons of zucchini filling in each crepe, and place into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour the half-and-half cream evenly over top of the crepes, and sprinkle with grated Manchego cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil, tenting if necessary so the foil does not touch the cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crepes are hot and the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes.
