it was so frustrating like a mystery I could solve night after night strange sensations in my legs falling asleep so I had to get up I had restless leg syndrome my doctor confirmed he said with a restless leg syndrome the symptoms usually get worse at night or in the evening when it's time to relax and then he has something else to be quick those are less symptoms that kept me from getting to sleep he told me what to watch for that Requip may cost you to fall asleep or feel very sleepy during normal activities such as driving to faint I feel dizzy when you stand up tell your doctor if you experience these problems or if you drink alcohol or taking medicines that make you drowsy side effects include nausea drowsiness vomiting and dizziness most patients were not bothered enough to stop taking real quick thanks to Requip the RLS mysteries not keeping me up anymore your doctor if Requip can help put your RLS to rest
