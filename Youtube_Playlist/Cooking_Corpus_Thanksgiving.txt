[Music] for years and years and years every time Jeffrey came home on Friday nights I would make birth chicken and then one day I got to be a little more creative from this want the house to smell great and of course I want to make chicken so each time I challenge myself to make something new I'm making chicken piccata which is wonderful when it start with two chicken breasts and when do a coating for them so they're sauteed and a lemon and butter sauce are so good so the first thing I need is 1/2 a cup of flour it's all for this flour Pepa teaspoon of salt 1/4 of a teaspoon of pepper and mix that all together that's the first part of the coating and it can be dipped into one egg just mix with a little touch of water put it all together the next part of the coating is bread crumbs you seasoned bread crumbs that's recorded in the cup okay a little oil in the pan just a few tablespoons and while that guests time I'm going to take the chicken breast [Music] just on the net so they get really thin chicken breast this or thicker parts and the senator and other parts and the sway the cook more evenly and they cook really quickly roll into the good Vassar some people have need pounding things but everybody has a rolling pin I like them between a quarter and a half inch thick and just do it in two directions so it ends up smooth doesn't in them and ridges okay so the first one goes into the flour just make sure it's coated all over shake off the excess into the egg and the flour drives it out and then the eggs make it so that's a break consulate here and then we're using drive break rub right in just two minutes on each side until it's golden brown [Music] okay that guy's done perfect you have a next one royal right it's it man two minutes on each side one of these replace Geoffrey's favorite roast chicken for Friday night chicken dinner [Music] perfectly done okay I put this on the sheet pan keep it warm in the oven 400 degrees for about 10 minutes right alongside the red onion and then I'm going to make a nice lemon butter sauce to go with it Oh perfect timing I just heard Jeffrey the weekend starts now typical stairs changing the red onions are roasting in the oven but erm of mashed potatoes are done and now I just have to make the sauce for the chicken piccata so first I'm going to do is just wipe out this pan that I cook the chicken in and I'm just going to heat up tablespoon of butter [Music] the chicken is warm in the oven is to be warm in the oven I just make a nice sauce for it okay now I need third cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice probably two lemon to pour it right into this butter okay now tech cup of white wine really nice dry white wine and something I drink for dinner okay half a teaspoon of salt quarter the piece for the pepper and this is what I'm going to do with the limit right in the top to get the flavor of the vet took comes together yeah the best eight bits a minute while I travel to far places like Lima some chicken for the onions a little bit of vinaigrette left over on the marinating each I always like to put on the end toss them all together it's just so good to do wonderful okay them chicken [Music] to the cottage saw slices of lemon significance lemons become a little bit of parsley Jerusalem is also good and love the way they look [Music] who doesn't love master tailor but erm of mashed potatoes your timing is perfect as always guess what's for dinner let's see it's Friday if you think you chicken but what kind of chicken is chicken piccata and it's right sister the physics is it up there with a roast chicken you know I used to think that roast chicken was the only thing I could have on Friday night but this chicken piccata this is just this day
my friends are coming from the city with their two adorable children and I thought I'd make children's food that grown-ups would like we're gonna feel like kids in a candy store so for dinner we're having parmesan chicken broccoli with bowties ice cream sundaes and chocolate truffles truffles are easier than you think they are it's basically cream which I've got nice and hot now and lots of chocolate which I'm going to chop up really fine so I've got a half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate and a half a pound of bitter chocolate the reason why I use both of them is because I think bittersweet chocolates a little too bitter and semi-sweet chocolates a little too sweet so I combine them to get the best of both worlds so I'm just gonna chop this up really finely that's good I'm gonna put it all in a big bowl what smells good already and then I'm gonna take the hot cream that just boiled I pour it through a sieve just to make sure you know sometimes you get a little bit of a skin on the top and you don't want that to happen and then a whisk and just stir it slowly until the hot cream melts the chocolate so I'm gonna make this mixture let it sit until it gets firm and then make little balls out of it and roll it in cocoa powder and confectioner sugar so good I love when it gets really shiny and it's doing that okay that's great nice and smooth so I'm gonna put in a little bit of vanilla got a half a teaspoon a really important ingredient for chocolate is coffee I'll show you for some reason coffee really brings out the flavour in chocolate so I'm just gonna add about a tablespoon of hot brewed coffee you won't really taste it but it'll make a huge difference in how the chocolate tastes when I can smell it when the hot coffee hits the chocolate it smells so good great that's perfect this is just gonna sit here for about an hour until it gets nice and firm in the meantime I'm gonna shopping for more sweets for my party years ago the African test I started filling these bags with candy I thought the kids would like them you and I know who's eating them on their way home so for my party I think that'd be great toppings for ice cream and gift bag for people on the way home lots of colors lots of flavors it's gonna be really fun ice-cream sundaes I'd like to do a few unusual flavors like raspberry sounds so delicious but I still need the classics chocolate and vanilla I have kids coming for dinner and we know what finicky eaters they can be so I thought I would make broccoli but I'm gonna put in bowtie pasta so they'll eat it so I'm going to start with a little bit of butter and olive oil to make the sauce the butter is for the flavor and the olive oil is because it has a higher burning temperature this is gonna be so good with Parmesan chicken so I'm gonna add chopped garlic and then I'm gonna make a lemon and garlic sauce for it and then at the end throw in Parmesan cheese and pignoli so it's got lots of flavor okay right into the pan with the garlic meanwhile I'm gonna zest it lemon this is a great zester because it actually has strips of lemon zest rather than a grater and that way the lemon zest gets cooked into the sauce and you can actually even see it in the dish which I like if it's going to taste like lemon I think it should look like lemons and I do it right over the pan so I get the oil you can see the oil from the lemon right into the sauce just I take the garlic for a minute until it's cooked so now I want the juice in it it's a really simple dish and it uses a really fresh ingredients so it's actually even good for you okay a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and the sauce is ready oh it smells garlicky and lemony it's gonna be wonderful so I've got bowtie pasta all cooked and I blanched some broccoli for a few minutes until it was like nice and green and then pour over the sauce right onto it just want to make sure I get all of it two teaspoons of salt about a half a teaspoon of pepper looks good and then when I had two more things grated Parmesan cheese that I graded and left in the fridge and the last thing is from your only nuts I sauteed something you always until they're just sort of brown and nutty they just taste so much better when they're a little browned and crisp right on the top just toss it all together mmm mister which is fresh from the lemon juice and it has the spiciness of the parmesan this gonna be really good for my party my friends are coming soon and I just want to finish the truck of truffles before they get here so this is a mixture of chocolate and cream perfect with a little vanilla and coffee to give it lots of flavor so to scoop these out most people use two spoons but I find a melon baller really works perfectly well just dip it in really hot water and then it'll come out perfectly great now comes the really messy part I'm going to dip some of them in powdered sugar just like that and some of them in cocoa powder these are so good they're pretty easy to make the named truffles really comes from a savory thing it's like the mushrooms that are dug up with pigs but these chocolate truffles supposed to be really rough like those mushrooms that are dug up so you don't want perfect little boss you don't want to sort of messy little things that are incredibly delicious inside what they should do is just melt in your mouth and these really will before I do the powdered sugar but it wash my hands otherwise all the mess so my party today is kids in the candy store I just thought it'd be really fun to have children's food that even grown-ups love so my friends are bringing their children we're absolutely adorable and we're going to have Parmesan chicken and broccoli with bow ties and ice cream sundaes we can all act like children oh I think my friends are here perfect timing I'm so glad to know you I got my hands in powdered sugar from the truffles nobody wants which I touch it with okay a little cooking so what would you guys like to do we go to the beach yeah what that sounds like that's it for today okay Kim I want to see what's in that bag I look really excited people see you later all right bye okay great first what's this well we have licorice our life rabbits are cool let's tie the napkin to a great idea of fabulous your bubble gum tree a little bit of bubble gum you know my girls they love bubble gum and when I have some really terrific Patties oh they're so cool those fun yeah I'm definitely wearing a hat okay candy dots oh great bring back all the memories eat something the best and some chocolate lots of chocolate coins fantastic how do ass lollipops integrate our welcome I love them so why don't I set the table and surprise you with the other goodies in event ask Iran okay I'm gonna finish dinner okay see ya but my friend Kim is the perfect person to do the table she runs EA T gifts which is the most incredible children's store in the city and she's bought wonderful goodies for everybody fruit juice shapes it's a really easy way to get fruit to us and for your kids what it is is a combination of really good juice and gelatin and the kids can pick it up in their hands it's really fun so I have four cups of fruit juice I'm using grape juice cuz kids love Concord grape juice three cups into the pan which I'm going to heat up and one cup into the bowl and then mix in four packages of gelatin I like this recipe two ingredients anybody can do it so I'm going to dissolve the gelatin in the fruit juice just like that and then pour the hot juice in and the good thing is you can do it with all different kinds of juices I like to use the clear juices okay mmm love the smell of Concord grape juice so we get this nice and hot doesn't have to be totally hot but just had enough to dissolve the gelatin yeah it's definitely ready there's a pour this in mix it up we pour it into the pan let it set then I'm going to cut out of shape to the kids they'll love them I'm having a party my friend Kim is doing the table setting isn't that nice her family's the beach and I'm doing the cooking so I'm gonna make Parmesan chicken which i think is great for kids and for adults Tamas on chicken to something my mother used to make for us as kids and I thought it'd be really fun to make my party it's boneless chicken breast I'm gonna cut each one into four long strips now I'm gonna do a coating so they have three things that we addictive chicken it and the first one is a cup of flour which are in the season with a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of pepper and just mix that up together so that's seasoned flour the second thing is two eggs a tablespoon of water just gonna mix those together and the third dish is a cup of seasoned breadcrumbs and you can just buy them already seasoned they're really very good about a cup and a half a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese which I keep in their fridge I'm just gonna mix those together well I can already smell the parmesan and the herbs wonderful okay and then I'm just gonna take these little chicken tenders and roll them roll whole bunch of them in flour and then dust them off there's a little bit of a process but it really means that the coating sticks to the chicken and make sure you get egg on all the parts and then move messy into the bread crumb and parmesan mixture coat the whole thing okay so now I'm going to saute them so as I usually do I'm going to mix oil and butter two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of oil melt these together you do this in a big pan but if you know of such a big pan you can always do it into smaller ones I'm gonna get this nice and hot and then saute the chicken and I'm gonna serve it with broccoli and bowties and for dessert what kid doesn't like ice cream sundaes and truffles so good and then go to chicken strips these are going to saute for about three to five minutes until they're really beautifully browned on the outside and still tender on the inside first I'm gonna go wash my hands okay ready to turn these guys throw they're nicely browned we'll be careful not to overcook because chicken can get really tough if it's overcooked gets tough and dry so these look great they smell spicy to the parmesan and smell the herbs and they're still really tender inside and if they start to stick a little bit just add more butter and oil to the pan I can keep these warm in the oven at 200 degrees for about fifteen to thirty minutes and they'll still be really tender and crisp on the outside these are gonna be so good for the stick on it everybody's on have a really good time so I thought it'd be find out the kids eat their juice so making fruit juice shapes it's grape juice and gelatin and I'm just gonna dunk this pan in hot water to loosen it a little bit that should do it okay turn it out on this plate and then cut out shapes and it worked okay I've got all kinds of you can cut it out in any shapes but I'm gonna do hearts and circles not great I love the weight jiggles and some rounds love to have circles that have fluted edges on them and some little hearts and it's fun when the grown-ups get to play - you make this all kinds of juices but I like the clear ones best like white grape juice or cranberry juice and they end up with a sort of jewel like colors which is great cuz you can also make it with orange juice if you want to and since these really are delicious there's one for me too one last thing to do with the parmesan chicken that smells great so I want to make chicken on a stick sometimes I use skewers but I think they're a little pointy for young kids so I'm going to use one of these so Oh Todd each piece of chicken is gonna go on a stick and it's gonna be like an ice cream pop it's great it's fun for the kids but I have to tell you it's really fun for the adults too oh I hear children hi you guys are fun at the beach what you do you run around a lot make a lot of noise yeah oh good it was beautiful - I'm making parmesan chicken on a stick does that look like fun to eat no good I can't wait either okay girls let's go let's it aren't to finish I'll see you in a second are they adorable or what and the last one and the last thing is just the broccoli and bowties it's already into a bone oh this smells so good I can smell the lemon of parmesan that looks great dinner everyone I have parmesan chicken sticks and would like to help me put that aside has a little lemon that look good oh good and everybody help yourself - chicken sticks okay our favorite one first you open your neck

about roaming whoops I think that's yours there's lots of their Oreos Eric so if you have camels so much does that mean you can't have the others no you everything you want wherever this kid in the candy store you can do anything you wanna do shake it good go it's your it's your performance on a fruit juice shake oh that looks good can we have a chocolate trust you mean you can't - and Jeffrey it goes really well with natto so just in case anybody didn't have enough sweets I get jelly beans for you guys to take home how's that I'm so glad you came I such a good time with you thank you so much Kim close Thank You Todd have a good trip and I'll see you again soon bye that was really fun but I may never eat candy again okay that's great nice and smooth so I'm gonna put in a little bit of vanilla that I have a teaspoon a really important ingredient for chocolate is coffee I'll show you for some reason coffee really brings out the flavour in chocolate so I'm just gonna add about a tablespoon of hot brewed coffee won't really taste it so for dinner we're having parmesan chicken broccoli with bowties ice cream sundaes and chocolate truffles truffles are easier than you think they are it's basically cream which I've got nice and hot now and lots of chocolate which I'm going to cup up really fine so I've got a half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate and a half a pound of bitter chocolate the reason why I use both of them is because I think bittersweet chocolates a little too bitter my friends are coming from this city with their two adorable children and I thought I'd make children's food that grown-ups would like we're gonna feel like kids in a candy store and then a whisk and just stir it slowly until the hot cream melts the chocolate so I'm gonna make this mixture let it sit until it gets firm and then make little balls out of it and roll it in cocoa powder and confectioner sugar so good I love when it gets really shiny and it's doing that and semi-sweet chocolates a little too sweet so I combined them to get the best of both worlds so I'm just gonna chop this up really finely that's good I'm gonna put it all in a big bowl and what smells good already and then I'm gonna take the hot cream that just boiled I pour it through a sieve just to make sure you know sometimes you get a little bit of a skin on the top and you don't want that to happen
[Music] I love Thanksgiving it's all the great fun of a holiday meal without all of that gift-giving that goes on later so I've been asked to write a magazine article about Thanksgiving dinner for just two and I thought I'd take the challenge so today I'm gonna test some traditional recipes but with a twist first tomato basil palm --yes which are a light delicious appetizer I can make in advance and bake before dinner then instead of a huge 20-pound turkey golden roasted Cornish hens which are perfect dinner for two stuffed with cornbread stuffing flavored with lots of onions and celery instead of mashed potatoes I'm making my favorite mashed turnips with crispy shallots and tender broccolini sauteed and garlic and butter and for dessert my friend Miguel's come in to do a table decoration entirely made of candy and fruit and he's not the only one helping out with the Thanksgiving for two my husband Jeffrey's agreed to be a taste tester I hope it's good so the first recipe I wanted to test for my Thanksgiving dinner is sun-dried tomato pom yeas now I've always made sweet pot amuse which of those elephant ears with sugar and I thought wouldn't it be great to make savory ones so the first thing is 100 cups of sun-dried tomatoes I'm just gonna chop them up because they're gonna end up being ground up in the food processor so I've got one and a quarter cups of sun-dried tomatoes it's really like making pesto gonna make it with basil Parmesan cheese garlic no I think about nine cloves of garlic I want about three tablespoons of minced garlic you don't have to chop a cellphone because the food processor is going to do all the work just put that in already smell the garlic and then I'm just gonna grind it up okay next thing is basil lots of it these are great flavors together basil and garlic and sun-dried tomatoes I want about five cups of basil leaves just gonna roughly take these off mmm love the way it smells okay right near the food processor get it a teaspoon of salt just a pepper really just like a pesto and then grind it all up [Music] and now I'm gonna slowly add 3/4 of a cup of olive oil and a cup of grated Parmesan cheese [Music] it smells great [Music] tomato and basil and garlic I wonder if it'd be good over pasta Jeffrey's out buying corn bread and broccolini well the comrade I know is gonna get right but the broccolini I wonder let's see she wants broccolini well this is broccoli but I broccoli need two bunches of broccolini I think this is it it looks a little different I'll get two bunches let's see cornbread here we go I'll hold my breath to make sure it's the right stuff puff pastry's this great little secret it's available in the freezer of every grocery store in America and if you've ever made it yourself you never want to do it so I've got one sheet that I've defrosted in the refrigerator this is still cold but if it gets warm and it's hard to work with just chill it for about five minutes just lightly roll it not too much so I'm going to take some of the sun-dried tomato pesto I'll just put it right on top it smells good I can smell the garlic and the tomato and just spread it out I suppose you could probably make savory puff pastry palm yays with all different kinds of things just plain pesto or Gris air and parmesan so just roll this right to the edge I want every Pommier to have the sun-dried tomato pesto on it that's really smooth okay and I'll show you how to roll it up so you can just like that on both sides and then halfway and again so it meets right at the middle so what happens is those layers of butter when the heat from the oven hits the layers of butter the water evaporates and it causes the pastry to really puff up and that's why it's called puff pastry and then you just fold it over just like that okay that's a nice little package so just slice about 3/8 inch slices it's like between a quarter and a half well they don't look like much now but I think they're gonna taste great okay quick egg wash which is an egg beaten with tablespoon of water just so they'd get nice and brown he's gonna make it a really high temperature by 400 degrees for about 10 or 11 minutes I'm gonna flip them halfway through around and crisp on both sides okay that's done these are gonna be really good and next I'm going to test Cornish hands with cornbread stuffing sounds good so the first thing I'm gonna do is make cornbread stuffing for the Cornish ends I've got everything already except the cornbread I've sent Jeffrey off to get it with a broccolini I hope he comes back with the right thing so they have to stick of unsalted butter it's four tablespoons and one cup of chopped onion it's about half of a large yellow onion I'm just gonna cook it for a few minutes until the onions turn translucent the next thing I need is one stalk of celery I'm just gonna dice it just run your knife right down the middle we used to make turkeys of every contestant with all different kinds of stuffing we'd make urban Apple stuffing sausage stuffing but I have to say my favorite was cornbread stuffing and it's really easy because you can buy cornbread from a store you can make it from a mix or you can make it yourself gonna have to celery to the onions and butter so they cook just a little bit 1/2 a cup of chicken stock how'd your shopping trip go good I got some rye bread you got corn bread broccolini thank you sweetie give the best shot so I'm testing a Thanksgiving dinner for two for magazines do you want to be my chief taste tester yeah they're gonna be really tough critic okay I'll meet you later [Music] Jeffrey got a nice cornbread cornbread stuffing is really classic Thanksgiving thing I like really simple ones but you can always add sausage or chestnuts whatever you like the hard part here is scaling it down so that I can make enough for two Cornish hams so I'm just guessing I need about two and a half cups of corn bread crumbs but since I'm recipe testing I never know just crumble it up like this I'm gonna add all that that's it this looks about right Ashley I think cornbread has more flavor than just regular breadcrumbs it's a little sweeter things can be really good okay so the corn breads all crumbled up I'm gonna add the celery and onions chicken stock right to the bone okay let's see okay a little bit parsley would be goodness it's like flat leaf parsley I think there's a little more flavor than curly parsley but whatever you have around is just fine okay it's just chop it up roughly I think about two tablespoons should do it rough chop doesn't have to be perfect okay and maybe a little salt and pepper to taste not too much cuz the corn breads got salt and pepper in it already stir it up make sure the cornbread absorbs all the butter and onions and parsley all the flavor okay time to stuff these guys so these are two Cornish hens if you can find fresh ones they're really good and I put them on a bed of onion so the onions cook with the Cornish hands just stand them on their little ends and fill each one Cornish ants are really like little chickens so they cook the same way but in less time okay that little guy's got that guy's good and then this guy the good news about this instead of cooking a turkey for hours these guys take about 35 to 40 minutes to cook well it looks like I made way too much stuffing for two Cornish hens but I guess that's why i test recipes notes had their little legs together the whole point of tying these things together is to make sure everything's very tight and it cooks evenly and then just tuck the little wings underneath so they stay tight okay more just keep these guys together so it's close to the body tuck their little wings under okay and then in order for them to Brennan you want the outside to be very dry it's a little paper towel I'm just gonna drive it and you can put a little bit of butter or olive oil on the outside I think I'll do olive oils right here just just a little olive oil it really helps it Brown nicely and keeps it moist let's rub it on the outside with a salt and pepper make sure it's really nicely seasoned okay I'm gonna roast these 425 for about 35 to 40 minutes until they're brown on the outside and juicy and tender inside [Music] my friend Miguel I'm so happy to see you dude thank you so much for doing this you know I love it seven so it's all edible things you'd be a bit absolutely every I can't wait to see what you're gonna do I get you all set up by the fireplace and right now I have a Davison turnips everybody thinks about mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving but I wanted to do something different so I thought I'd make mashed turnip no this isn't like the traditional turnip which is white with a little purple on it this is a rutabaga and you've seen it in the store you've never known what to do with it but it's really good it's gorgeous and yellow inside and I'm gonna do it with crispy shallots which I'm already cooking here and I'm just frying the shallots for about 35 minutes until they're nice and crisp and brown and I think they're just about there I'm just gonna drain these on paper towels so they get really crisp so it's a creamy vegetable and crisp shallots on the top I look like two textures together don't they should be done by now so these are the turnips just gonna drain them and what I did was I peeled them dice them and cook them for about 35 or 40 minutes until they're really tender then you put a knife and you can tell it just goes in easily it's really like potato okay we put them in a food processor this is a great vegetable because it lasts a long time and you can reheat it over a double boiler okay and I'm just gonna add some hot butter and milk a cup of milk and three kurz of a stick of butter [Music] right so it's nice and smooth and creamy okay how beautiful that is that's great teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper mix it up it says great so I'm gonna serve this with crispy shallots on it's hot but right now I'm gonna keep it warm over a pan of simmering water I know what that an edible table setting so I thought candy dry fruit and nuts some ginger we have dates here California figs Thanksgiving colors oranges and yellows and reds I'm going to surround the marzipan jelly bean I'm almost there so one last thing to test for Thanksgiving dinner for two now I'm gonna make a different kind of vegetable Muslim for unusual vegetables this is called broccolini it's unlikely enough cross between broccoli and Chinese kale and it's actually more delicate than broccoli and I like it a lot so it comes with stalks and you just like broccoli but they're thinner I just want to cut off the last third which I've done and if any of them are really thick you just want to peel it a little bit it's got a nice peppery flavor it's a little sweeter than broccoli and it's just delicious so the first thing is I'm gonna blanch it in a big pot of boiling salted water lots of salt and then just throw it right in and that's gonna just boil for about three to five minutes until it's just tender and then I'm gonna shock it by putting in ice water in the meantime I think the corniche hands are done oh they smell wonderful and a nice bed of onions so I'm just gonna test it to see if it's done if you cut between the leg and the thigh and the juices run clear it's done and it's perfect so I'm just gonna cover it with aluminum foil for about 15 minutes it retains all the heat and it brings the juices and the flavors right back into or defense keeps it nice and warm for dinner meanwhile I think the broccolini is boiled and I'm just going to drain it and then shock it in ice water to stop the cooking and then later I'm going to saute it with garlic and lemon and butter to be delicious Oh Miguel your table setting looks fabulous very bountiful for Thanksgiving what do you guys like dates and crystallized ginger and I like in pumpkins and everything else that's wonderful well I don't know if my pom yeas are as successful as you table settings wanna try one they're um they're sun-dried tomatoes and basil and garlic [Music] [Laughter] [Music] let me girls table with two fabulous it's gonna be great in the article so it's time to cook the broccoli me again I'm gonna saute i blanched it first I'm gonna add a little lemon zest give it lots of flavor so a little bit of lemon zest it's good if you put it in a pan and cook it a little bit garlic just about one clove of chopped garlic keep the heat on just cook it for 30 seconds just so it's incorporated in the butter and now we had the blanch broccolini I'm gonna shake it dry as much as possible all you want to do here is just give it lots of flavor and heat it all the way through [Music] pepper lemon juice that's actually what I'd love to bland something first and then saute it before dinner it's so fast the farm ready to serve okay dinner's ready sweetie dinner's ready Jeffrey thinks that day like any other day but down here it's Thanksgiving crispy shallots Jeffrey's a very good taste tester he likes everything crispy shallots on top how bad could that be so right okay gorgeous little Cornish em and a little bit of science [Music] that looks wonderful to Thanksgiving this year the taste tests are in the real Thanksgiving well I'll be your taste tester here anytime you want now am I supposed to say that to this point I don't think anybody feels sorry nobody believed me that you bought I bought personally I want you know I picked out so what's the idea the stuffing is directly related to the cornbread that I so let's put Miguel to this edible table decorations so we've got dried fruit candied ginger I think they're crystallized walnuts they look amazing jelly beans if anybody's up for jelly beans marzipan just in case you're still hungry after that very large Cornish and in about two hours so what do you think things good enough for a magazine article I think it's too good
[Music] I have some very dear friends coming I'm going to make my favorite roast turkey dinner oh that's a big turkey I don't understand why our mothers used to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning to roast a turkey I can't figure it out I think they have this thing about bacteria a 12 pound turkey should roast in about two and a half hours and it will be moist and delicious that's a beautiful bird so first I'm going to do is take out the giblets like the neck and the hmm cold it's wet and I'm going to save it for stock later and it looks beautiful and then I'm going to Pat it dry I have my friend Barbara's family coming for dinner it's gonna be really fun and she's a new grandson Timothy who's just incredible he's I think he's about six months old so adorable so in my growth Turkey spinach bread tan which is really good and smashley potatoes and for dessert and make my favorite class on bread pudding it's going to be a really good meal so I'm going to put some salt in the middle and some freshly ground pepper make sure it's really well seasoned we're not going to do stuffing you know it's enough of the stuffing I'm going to put all kinds of things in the cavity that are going to give it lots of flavor so I'm going to stuff it with onion forget peeling it forget just chop the whole thing up and just put it right into the inside of the turkey great and then maybe big sprigs of thyme and then we're going to have lemon whose big chunks of lemon in just like that it's going to be so delicious and then maybe the last thing is a big chunk of garlic put a big chunk of it right in the middle of the turkey and then the last thing is I'm going to take these little wings and tuck them under just so they're not flapping around in the pan and that they they burn before the turkeys finish cooking you're basically just doing that because it turkey it doesn't mind so I've got about four tablespoons of butter i melted in here just brush it nicely on the outside of the bird okay good and then salt and pepper remember it's a big bird so salt it really well and some pepper in the pan so by two and a half hours of 350 degrees and we're gonna have a fabulous turkey with spinach gratin and smashed sweet potato the best thing about making things in advance or a party is it allows me plenty of time to relax member Hayes they hate spinach when you're a kid the spinach grant is so delicious that even the children will leave it not that a little bit so we've got the butter melted and about four cups of onions or do this for about 10-15 minutes over medium flame until the onions are really cooked but they're not browned so let that go for a little while and it's ready so this is the secret of this dish frozen spinach is just as good as fresh so much easier so I've got five packages of frozen spinach which is about three pounds just squeeze all the water out of this just really squeeze it so you've got all the liquid out and then put it in a bowl that's done onions are just cooking they're not browning which is to try I'm just off in a quarter of a cup of flour and then she really only just have to cook for about a minute until the flour is cooked in with that sort of raw flour taste added that 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg nutmeg sort of a classic thing with spinach and I think it's got great flavor so now I need a cup of heavy cream and two cups of milk and you know you really can make this with all milk but it's a special occasion someone make it with scream so that's probably going to take about five minutes for to heat up enough so it starts to thicken so it's not really thick it's not gluey it's just thickened great so the next thing is problems on cheese this is a chunk of Reggiano parmesan and it's really the best it's aged so it has great flavor but you can get grana you can get any kind of even Argentinian parmesan it's pretty good if you have a food processor it's a really easy way to do this but you can always do it with a box grater presto grated Parmesan so now I'm going to add half a cup of grated Parmesan it's the quarter cup measure SOPA to it tablespoon of kosher salt and a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and the last ingredient is spinach so I'm just going to break up this spinach and put it in and take it off the flame just mix the spinach in which I see how this all comes together much Paul this thin is just and absorb all that wonderful sauce and that's where I take the water out because at this point it would be like soup if you didn't okay into my pan I'm not going to cook this yet because it only takes 20 minutes to cook so I'll just set it aside until I'm ready to put it in the oven why do people only sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving I can't figure it out I think they're delicious so I've roasted these at 375 for about an hour and they're really done when they're nice and squishy and drizzle it with a little butter and salt and pepper they're wonderful but today I'm going to make smashed sweet potatoes because it's a special day these are cooled a little bit so I can handle them and I'm just going to take a spoon and scoop out the wonderful sweet potato flesh I'm going to have my friend Barbara's family who two gorgeous daughters and her new grandson some really fun and one more half and we're there okay now for all the flavorings that's a good part so the first thing is I need 1/2 a cup of orange juice and 1/2 a cup of heavy cream no wonder it tastes good right I'm just going to put in 2 tablespoons of butter teaspoon of nutmeg 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and the last thing is a quarter cup of brown sugar this is one of those recipes that just put some sweet potatoes in a mixer and I started adding things until I like to attest of life so you can turn the mixer on and miss the big homies gorgeous ingredients actually I'm a friend she doesn't recipe like this made bourbon how bad could that be New Orleans el-masri potatoes so what that sector of this to be really course but not not pureed I think baby food I like what it has some texture to it it just takes a minute in the mixer to do that looks so good mmm really brings out the sweet that it the sweetness and the sweet potatoes all the brown sugar and the orange you can taste all with it what's just wonderful nutmeg and cinnamon would be great with the dinner and this too it's a great dish for holiday entertaining or for any kind of entertaining for that matter you can make it in advance keep in the refrigerator I'm not going to cook it now I'm going to set it aside and I'll heat it up with a spinach Gretchen for about half an hour 375 [Music] [Music] so for my turkey dinner I think instead of doing flowers for the table I'm gonna do something more interesting which is all kinds of fresh fruit dried apricots and dried mango things can be really gorgeous [Music] [Music] hey gravy well it's not that I hate gravy I just hate that you make at the minute before you sit down you know here you are the turkeys hot your friends are hungry and I'm usually dressed in my party clothes and then I have to start making gravy I don't think so so I decided to find an easier way to do it the first thing I'm doing is sauteing about a cup and a half of onions in some butter and I like to saute them so they're really nice and translucent and maybe just a little bit brown the butter can brown a little bit it will make a dark gravy and this is my secret I saved the drippings from the last time I made turkey and I'll use that for making gravy this time this is old liked or just delicious steps in the gravy there's a little fat on the top so I'm just going to pour it out and just use the drippings at the bottom and I have here about two cups of chicken stock homemade chicken stock is great if you can't just use a really good can stock and I'm going to pour all of these drippings into that to really enrich it and give it lots of flavor now I need a little flour add a quarter cup of flour goes in with the cooked onions and butter and this is what's going to thicken the gravy okay cook that for about a minute and then I'm going to pour in this hot stock thicken up beautifully this is the way to prevent having 1'p gravy which is everybody's nemesis so that teaspoon of salt I like to use kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper when I did will try a quarter and see how it is just taste it as you go along very individual too and next is my secret ingredient I'm yack well cognac is really very good brandy from the cognac region so you can use any kind of brandy or con yet that you have around the house I love the smell of that connect when it hits the hot gravy it's fabulous some leftover white wants a little splash of white wine in that should be good and then the last thing is a little bit of heavy cream you can do this or not but I just think it enriches it enough so it really gives it special okay and then the good part I get to taste it's just gorgeous got all that coming a canned wine and the turkey juice and it just gonna be perfect so now I've got the roast turkey spinach Gretchen smashed sweet potatoes and the last thing I want to make is costs on bread pudding can't wait for dinner I want to ask my friends what their favorite dessert is they always say quad salt bread pudding so that's what we're going to make for dinner tonight and what's amazing is it's so easy so the first thing I to do is make the custard a three whole eggs and five egg yolks and I'm going to add in five cups of half-and-half I know I know it's a lot of half-and-half but I wouldn't recommend you eat this every day it's a special occasion whisk that in and then I need a cup and a half of sugar and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla the good news is you're not gonna believe how easy this is to make list on all of you really like a bread pudding except to Ike's turns turn up the volume and made it with cloths off so that's it for the custard so I'm going to get my dish ready I'm going to cut these costs on these are a little stale that came out of the freezer they were leftover you can use fresh cloth on but it's really better interesting would use stale ones because they're drier and they absorb that custard better I actually decided to try it with cross them because I thought their serve lighter and airier than bread and I thought it'd be really nice to see how it works I have about six cross on here but you can really use as many quests ons will fit in the pan you want two layers of cross on this has about a cup of raisins in it and I put the raisins actually between the layers of cross off because if they end up on top shell burn when I de then I'm going to put the second layer on you need to do with a brown side up or the brown side down but just do it consistently so it's the same all right now I put all this fabulous custard on pour over the whole thing now comes the fun part you have to just get the quest felt absorb all that custard by holding it down for a minute you can see the bubbles coming up so just it's absorbing all that gorgeous custard so let that soak for a minute while I get the water bath ready so sometimes a good idea when you're making custard to put it in water bath it actually keeps the temperature down a lot of people say you have to boil the water I just use really hot tap water easier the better I'm going to cover the pan not just the dish but the whole pan with foil put it into a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes and by then the custards going to start to set and then I'll take the foil off bake it for another 45 minutes and you'll see it's going to get really puffed and brown gorgeous you go carefully because you don't want water and cut you know you don't have to spend a fortune on table decoration you'd be surprised what you can find in the woods attended here love crabapples and now and we look at myself ready for the party expensive table winter when the flowers are expensive sometimes I like to go to the grocery store and get all kinds of decorations for the table I love winter colors purples and reds and oranges and twigs from my garden get some sort of a wintry feeling cornucopia delicious little treats like fresh fit and crystallized ginger dried applica and dried papayas and then everybody's got a little treat at the end of the meal for dessert so the quest on bread puddings been baking for about 45 minutes and 350 and now I'm going to take off the foil I'm going to bake another 45 minutes until it gets puffed and nicely browned will be delicious it was a turkey smells so good oh love not with gorgeous so I'm just going to wrap it up with aluminum foil really makes a difference if you let it rest for about 20 minutes which is perfect because that will give me enough time thinking it's the rest of the vegetables just what the juices get into the meat and the whole thing will taste fabulous my sweet potatoes and the spinach grits am just going to do a topping on the spinach grunta as though it needs extra flavor I'm going to put extra flavor on it so remember the spinach Gretchen has spinach and onions and I'm going to put about half a cup of grated Parmesan well maybe about a quarter of a cup should do it and I'm just going to do a little bit of grated Gruyere on top okay the two of these are gonna go into the oven we've got 375 for about 20 minutes and then they'll be good and hot for dinner [Music] get the question for it putting out of the oven so Gord I don't rest on top of the stone and now to carve the turkey i carve a turkey the same way I carve a chicken I'll show you what I do wanna take a length off relax perfectly cooked cause the dark needle of this okay cause it darkly first on the side okay then I'm going to carve this turkey breath because it would take a full breath off actually once you just what I do with a chicken so perfect should slice it how much easier do this one that works when the slices are so incredibly famous they'd fall apart just like that okay maybe a second pair here that's done so good finished sweet potatoes [Music] that was really fun as far abroad how do I pass the sweet potatoes nervous like I creamed spinach come on you emigrate a little bit right here in the grandeur [Music] good up to five o'clock this morning absolutely my mother to get up assignments with the turkey in the oven I don't understand it yes for dessert quest on bread pudding everybody's favorite assessment very large portion [Laughter] [Music] holiday we don't need like this there play dish [Music]
[Music] but I told my friends I was thinking about making ham for Thanksgiving they went crazy no Turkey they cried so I decided to cave in and I'm making everyone's favorite turkey with urban Apple stuffing pumpkin banana mousse tart and no [Music] so for Thanksgiving everybody asks that pumpkin pie but at my house my mother used to make a pumpkin banana mousse tart which was actually really good so I'm doing a version of that it's kind of like pumpkin pie with the volume turned up and the good news it starts with a graham cracker crust so 14 graham crackers all ground up it's about 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs third of a cup of sugar and I put a little bit of cinnamon in I just think it gives it a nice pumpkin pie spice lots of flavor big on flavor and the last thing of course is butter so it's one stick of melted butter I'm just gonna mix it all together so later I'm gonna fill this with a pumpkin mousse that's flavored with a little bit of banana which makes it wonderfully sweet and some orange zest and lots of spices it's really good into an 11 inch tart shell clean hands always a cook's best tool so just Pat it out so it's even and then I take a cup measure middle cup measure and do the edge just like that and then you know and then for the thick crust right at the edge so much easier than traditional pie crust so into the oven 350 degrees for about 10 minutes until it's just a little firmer than it is now now we get to make the good part the pumpkin banana mousse filling so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of half-and-half and I'm gonna put it into a double boiler I know every starter set of pots comes with a double boiler which is two pots one on top of the other but you can really make your own double boiler by putting a heatproof bowl directly over a pot and then you can have all different sizes and the next thing is one 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree I've done this with cooking a pumpkin and puree it or a can of pumpkin puree and believe me you can't tell the difference and I can tell you which one's easier okay so that's in next ingredient is one cup of brown sugar and you want this sort of lightly packed it's how brown sugar is generally measured right into the pumpkin and then some good spices 3/4 of teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg big wooden spoon and just stir it around so I'm gonna cook this for about five minutes until it just gets warm and then I'm gonna add egg yolks to it to make a custard but I think the tart shell is ready to come out of the oven [Music] perfect it's just a little Brown around the edges I'm just gonna cool and get firm so now I'm gonna make the custard so I've got two egg yolks and what I want to do is I want to warm up the egg yolks a little bit with a pumpkin mixture so and I'll end up with scrambled eggs just like making a traditional custard and then pour the whole thing back into the hot pumpkin mixture see when ice scraper I just want to get all of it and just mix that up and just cook that for about four or five minutes so it's gonna go into that tart shell it's gonna cool overnight if you want to you can make it the day before and then I'm gonna decorate it with whipped cream so it's not only delicious but it's really gorgeous so let's take one package of gelatin and just soften in a quarter of a cup of cold water when it's chilled the egg yolks are gonna help the mousse to set but the gelatin is gonna help it - okay off the heat I'm just gonna add these other ingredients mashed bananas the softened gelatin and the last thing is orange zest okay I'm just gonna stir this up so while that cools I'm gonna whip the cream you need about 1/2 a cup of heavy cream and then I'm gonna use more for decoration later but and 2 tablespoons of sugar okay that should do it didn't do this with a hand mixer if you want to also okay that's perfect with whipped cream you want to make sure that it's really firm like that that it stands up but if you get it too far you end up with butter don't want that okay I'm gonna fold this into the pumpkin mixture so put the whipped cream right in the middle and then the spatula I use a rubber spatula just go straight down through the middle and then fold it over that way straight down through the middle and then right to the bottom of the bowl and then fold it over just keep doing that until it's really more mixed she's looking gorgeous perfect right into the graham cracker crust it smells great and the good news about this is you can make it in advance leave in the fridge for a day and then decorate it just before you're going to serve doesn't look at bad doesn't so I pulled on my friends to find out what their favorite thing for Thanksgiving is but the truth is I can't have Thanksgiving without this cranberry fruit can serve so I'm going to add a cup of water and one in 3/4 cups of sugar so I'm gonna cook this together for about 5 minutes until the cranberries sort of pop open when it gets really hot the skins burst open and then you get all of the cranberry fruit in this conserve the next thing I'm gonna put it in is apple and actually granny smith apples are great because the green apples have a lot of pectin in it and it's the pectin that's gonna make the cranberry fruit conserve set so you want to pick a really tart apple the tart of the Apple the more pectin it has I'm just gonna peel this little guy and then just chop it up you wanted to sort of disappear when it cooks into the she serve so I'm gonna chop it up fine this Apple is nicely chopped up it's gonna go into a bowl and then I'm gonna have the zest of an orange and the zest of a lemon and the fruit also I can hear the cranberries popping okay one orange and the zest of a lemon I just think this really takes away from the sweetness of the fruit conserve okay that's the zest I'm just gonna check and see how the cranberries are doing and I'd say they're popping okay that's gonna cook for another few minutes while I juice the fruit okay so the juice of one arms and the juice of a lemon okay so all this is gonna go in the apples and the orange zest and lemon zest and then I'm gonna cook them all together for about 15 minutes and you'll see that Apple just sort of melts into the cranberry fruit conserve and the pectin in the apple is gonna make the whole thing jail just it's magic great so while that's cooking we're gonna start the urban Apple stuffing it's a really good stuffing for the turkey it's very traditional it's got much more modern zing to it and now I just need to get some other ingredients four cups of onions two cups of chopped celery always get them in advance the next thing is to chopped apples into the sauté pan with the celery and okay so that's gonna cook on sort of medium-low heat so I'm gonna have it about two tablespoons of fresh parsley it doesn't have to be perfectly minced just serve wrap and then I'm gonna do but I'm gonna have teaspoons of fresh rosemary and we just need salt and pepper the onions have just start to brown and I think it really pleased had all the flavor of vegetables for the meantime let me finish the cranberry sauce [Music] so with traditionalists I'm gonna leave it plain and for people like me that want a little more flavor I'm gonna add walnuts and raisins so these are two dishes I want to serve them in and I can just chill them right in the dish so that's the cranberry fruit concern now everybody wants Thanksgiving exactly the way they remember when they were kids so I really try and do it for each person the way they remember it and Steven doesn't like nuts so I want to make sure yes exactly what he wants so I'm just gonna add raisins and chopped walnuts to the rest just mix them in and it's got great flavor and texture so we've got cranberry fruit conserved for the traditionalists and the wild and crazy ones so I have bread cubes that I've toasted sourdough bread which I like and I toasted them just so they get some of the moisture out and then it'll really absorb the flavors of the turkey and stock and everything else so I'm just gonna take all the vegetables I just cooked and pour it right over I'm gonna add about a cup of chicken stock it smells the cooked apples and celery and toss it all together and that's ready to go inside a big bird this year I tried suggesting to my friends that would make a big Virginia ham for Thanksgiving and they went nuts they said we have to have turkey so we're having Turkey so I've got a really good fresh 12 pound turkey and I'm gonna stuff it and trust it and it's so easy won't believe it no when I was young my mother used to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to make turkey I think I had this feeling they had to cook for like 15 hours but the truth is Turkey really only used about two and a half hours to cook and it'll be really moist and delicious so I'm just gonna stuff the cavity full but not really packed you want the heat to be able to get around so it can cook properly okay that looks good so I'm just gonna tie it's a little legs together and then tie around the tail so that's not flapping around just cut it off and the only other thing to do is just take the wing tips just like doing a chicken just tuck them right underneath the body so it keeps them from flapping around okay and then the last thing is I'm just gonna brush it with butter salt and pepper [Music] so this turkey I'm gonna roast at 350 degrees for about two and a half hours and stirring noise and delicious now comes the fun part decorating the pumpkin banana mousse tart it's out in the refrigerator until it just sat and then I'm gonna decorate it with whipped cream that's pretty good so far so I need a cup of heavy cream quarter of a cup of sugar and a splash of vanilla when I say a splash of an element a quarter a half a teaspoon I'm just gonna whip it until it's firm [Music] that looks good I want it really nice and firm but not turned into butter and that's about right great [Music] so the easiest way to decorate this and it's perfectly great is to do whipped cream around the middle leaving a little border of pumpkin sort of like meringue on the top but I love to pipe it so I'll show you how to do that so take a pastry bag with a big star tip on it I think that's the nicest one and the easiest you know piping looks really mysterious but the way I learned how to do it is I just spent a day piping buttercream or whipped cream just practice and you'll get it I'm the best way to practice it's just on a board or on the marble so because you can keep using it over and over again so I'll show you if you wanted to do a shell pattern which is what I like to do just a little bit like that just like that and it's really about the pressure in the bag and really getting a feel for it it's not that hard if you want to do something even simpler it's just stars but I think for this one I'm gonna do the shell pattern so just all the way around just do like a ripping pattern and the good news is if you make a mistake you can just scoop it back into the bag and do it again how hard is that okay then maybe swirl in the middle great and then because I like the decoration to be the flavors that are in the tart I thought it'd be really nice to decorate it with a little bit of orange maybe some orange zest the traditional thing that I use for orange zest is this zester but you see it ends up very fine and I think I have a better way to decorate see it's really too fine but then the other zester is this little wonderful tool that just has little sharp edges and I'll show you what it does with the orange it has long strips of zest and I think that would be really pretty to decorate the tart with and then just take it and put it around the edge just slightly so now somebody knows it's pumpkin and orange and cream and delicious and it's ready for dessert I'm so we keep in the refrigerator until we're ready to serve it I think that's not bad have to say carving is not something that generally do with company around because I can make a real mess just put up a leg nice big leg for somebody that likes that what I do is I let the turkey sit for about 20 minutes and if all the juices get right back into the turkey it really makes it flavorful and moist and the trick of the white meat is instead of slicing it the way it's traditionally done I'm going to run my knife where I mean cut off the entire breast in one piece and then slice it it's exactly what I like to do a chicken and then just slice it right across I think it's so much easier than wrestling with it this looks really sudden one side and I would say that looks like Thanksgiving and I have parmesan smashed potatoes every family has their favorite recipe so this is mine and I keep it warm on the top of the double boiler and then Frank wanted Brussels sprouts and roasted Brussels sprouts I rest them a really high temperature with olive oil salt and pepper couldn't be easier and that's what Frank wanted for Thanksgiving and plain cranberry fruit conserve and cranberry food conserved with raisins and nuts come everybody help yourself this so wonderful and I read do you have enough cranberry sauce Parsa a little sour cream here's to the absent [Music] my experience is nobody remembers what they have for dinner but they always remember dessert all right who wants pumpkin banana mousse tart I know Nyree needs a casement there's everybody cool so it turns out you know how to cook sometimes I even surprise myself Happy Thanksgiving [Music]
[Music] isn't choosing holiday gifts the worst friends of mine believe that all present should be things that disappear gather have to be used or consumed in one sitting like theater tickets or food I've decided to surprise my friends Joanne new bald and Maureen Mullin we call him Joe and Moe by leaving all kinds of wonderful edible gifts under their tree first a welcome home cup of steaming white hot chocolate with a shot of Grand Marnier then cranberry harvest muffins that are packed with dried fruit and spices and big bags of delicious homemade cherry almond and cinnamon granola and I've packed the basket with more treats than they can imagine but that's not all I've asked my friends Michael Grimm and TR pest got to sneak in during the day and decorate their house for the holidays I hope Joey and my lovin something about the holidays that calls for really special treats and I think of truffles chocolate truffles as one of those and you won't believe how easy it is then take a half a cup of heavy cream and just heat it up what you don't want to do is boil this because there's nothing worse than the taste of boiled cream okay can't make chocolate truffles without lots of chocolate I'm using bittersweet and semi-sweet I think bit up sweets a little too bitter and semi-sweet a little too sweet so I like to combine the two and get it sort of halfway in between so that's three net bounces of semi-sweet chocolate chop it up fairly fine because what I'm gonna do is pour the hot cream over it and I'm gonna melt the chocolate this is surprisingly easy candies America and I'm gonna chop up three new fences of bittersweet you know true chocolate aficionados only like bittersweet chocolate but I have to say a little bitter for me so the key to this is to add flavorings that really complement the chocolate I find vanilla and coffee really make chocolate taste more chocolaty and then I like to add one other flavor so there's sort of a back note to it very often I use Grand Marnier but this time I think I'm gonna do it with hazelnuts so I'm gonna do chopped hazelnuts on the outside and Frangelico with which is hazelnut liqueur on the inside so the next thing I'm gonna do is pour this warm cream it's actually hot it's just under the simmering point through a strainer onto the chocolate and the cream is gonna melt the chocolate you want to do it through a strainer because there's always a little bit of sort of a skin of milk it's not pretty in chocolate and just stir this a good thing about the system is you can't overheat the chocolate the cream just gets under the simmering point and it'll just melt the chocolate so we'll let that melt and add the other flavorings so the first thing is why don't ask tablespoons a Frangelica will occur which is a hazelnut liqueur but any kind of a nut liqueur be really wonderful with this one tablespoon of coffee prepared coffee which I have from this morning and if it's hot it's even better helps melt the chocolate and half a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and if I fold my cards right the chocolate should be melted by now so just stir it around if for any reason the chocolate doesn't melt you can always put it over simmering pan of water for a minute but I think it should be good I can't wait to go to Joey and Moe's to put these treats under the tree but I understand that there are some elves they're already putting things together can't wait to see it [Music] chocolates all melted it's nice and smooth and I bet it's pretty good so good I love the balance of bittersweet and semi-sweet and you can really taste the Frangelico so I'm gonna chill to serve at 45 minutes and then make little balls and roll them in hazelnuts they're gonna be great as a surprise [Music] should we unwrap it yeah and then then we can see if it's you know even holy Wow yeah right right okay I'm gonna get started at the table and I'm gonna do my favorite decorating so Michael bouncing off of your gold silver and red theme and I'm doing silver and white and so it's time to scoop the truffles so what I've got is a chilled mixture of semi-sweet chocolate bittersweet chocolate and all kinds of delicious flavorings like hazelnut liqueur Frangelico vanilla coffee and cream they've been chilling in the refrigerator you can scoop this with spoons the old-fashioned light but a small ice cream scoop makes it really lovely it's easy and you get every single ball exactly the same and I'm gonna roll each one and chopped hazelnuts that I've toasted in an oven for about 10 minutes at 325 now that looks good enough to eat I think Joey no we're gonna love these remember you don't want perfect little circles you want them to look like wild truffles that's great for the holidays just pack them up in a bag and it's a great hostess gift okay last one no and the hazelnuts so these are perfectly delicious at room temperature on a plate but since I'm gonna pack them in a bag from Joey and Moe I'm gonna chill them for a little bit until they get nice and firm so they can pile up beautifully I think they're gonna be very happy at Christmas morning [Music] next I think I'm gonna make cranberry harvest muffins and maybe a cherry almond cinnamon granola that's gonna be good [Music] cranberries are one of the classic holiday foods because they're only in season from Thanksgiving to Christmas this recipe for muffins comes from one of my favorite cookbooks open house cookbook by Sarah Chase Sarah you said this wonderful specialty food store in Nantucket called que sera sera and of course that's where cranberries are going so the first thing one do is chop cranberries not easy to do they roll around on the board like mad just like that really coarse and then we also have figs so these are dried figs just take off that little stem and then just dice those these muffins are really easy to make all you do is combine the dry ingredients the wet ingredients and all these good chunky ingredients okay now to make the muffins so I've got three cups of all-purpose flour just lighten it with your cup it's make lots of muffins and then tablespoon of baking powder baking powders always double-acting the first time it starts going is when it gets wet and the second time is when it hits the heat in the oven and I need 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt a lots of spices tablespoon good cinnamon ground cinnamon mmm that's the most very holiday ish and 2 teaspoons of ground ginger which is a great flavor okay so sift these together and then actually combines them they make sure there are no little particles in the flour and there aren't perfect so there's the dry ingredients just combine the flour and the cinnamon and ginger it smells great just make it well right in the middle now we need one and a quarter cups of milk just gonna make about 18-month ins ran the milk 2 eggs I use actual extra-large eggs just needs a little bit right in the middle and two sticks of melted butter and then just stir all this together until it's just combined don't over mix it you'll end up with tough muffins with it okay next thing is the cranberries all the chopped cranberries and chopped figs and then two kinds of sugar 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar that gives it a really sort of caramel flavor very holidays 3/4 of a cup of white sugar no the cranberries are really tart so needs a lot of sugar and then just stir it all together Joey just finished renovating her house she designed it herself can't wait to see how they're decorating it so many tips for decorating a tree just does a great job thank you I like to use white light green cords of course that blend in with the tree then I'd like to do a mixture of different sizes and shapes and I also like to take ornaments and put them deep into the tree because it's just to give it that fullness and I actually like to use great florist wires to hang the ornament because you can cut them at every different lengths that's such a great idea like because it gives you the illusion that they're just floating that's great it really does okay would you change too much so I'm just scooping cranberry harvest muffins into the pans I'm just gonna bake them awesome to be nice and fresh Joanna mo okay and you know my pickups make that 18 muffins these cups are great you can just buy them anywhere I particularly like the plain white ones [Music] is battered fabulous you can actually store it in the refrigerator [Music] I'm gonna bake these 375 for about 20 to 25 minutes until they're nice and puff would be really sweet and tart and perfect for holiday breakfast [Music] and next I'm gonna make wonderful granola with dried cherries almonds and cinnamon something to the next treat I want to make for a good holiday breakfast is granola you can make it all different kinds of flavors but I'm gonna make granola with coconut cherry almond and lots of cinnamon so I'm gonna start with 4 cups of old-fashioned oats you don't want quick-cooking 2 cups of sliced almonds they're blanched sliced ons and 1 cup of coconut it's sweetened shredded coconut this is great cuz it you can eat it right away but it also sits in the pantry really well and then for this one I'm gonna use dried cherries they're really good they're sweet and they're tart and they'd be great in this we need 1 and 1/2 cups just really roughly chopped just so they get distributed and for Nolan okay one and a half cups of dried cherries right into the granola it's a big batch what's the next thing is vegetable oil I need 1/2 a cup let's put right on top and 1/3 of a cup of honey and this is the secret to honey if you put the vegetable oil in the container first the honey I'll just pour right out look at that instead of sticking to the container perfect I know lots of really good Grand Central huh that doesn't smell like the holidays I don't know what does two teaspoons of ground cinnamon you don't want the stuff that's been sitting in your spice drawer for 10 years we want it to be really fresh okay just mix it all together and then I'm gonna bake it for a bit 20 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees you know it's just fabulous to have around the house because it's good Krauser it over ice cream or for a little snack with yogurt but for breakfast it's perfect [Music] they just spread it around that's gonna bake at 350 for about 20 to 30 minutes I'm gonna toss it in the middle make sure it Browns evenly until it's really crisp and golden and that's gonna be good for holiday breakfast very harassed muffins smell like they're done [Music] if it comes out clean they're done go put them on the top let them go [Music] gorgeous [Music] Oh fantastic [Music] I've got a little bit more green to put on the table and then I think we are finished so I thought the minute Joey and Moe walk in the door wouldn't it be nice to have a big steaming cup of hot chocolate I'm gonna do it with a twist I'm gonna do hot white chocolate with a little Grand Marnier it is the holidays after all so I pour in hot cups of milk 4 cups of half-and-half I'm gonna heat that up slowly you don't want it to get boiling and then I'm gonna chop up 1 pound of white chocolate this is really good white chocolate no like chocolate bars don't use chocolate chips they have stabilizers in them and won't B's luxuriously smooth I actually tried all different kinds of liqueurs in this thinking what would be the best I tried Frangelica which is hazelnut I tried a coffee liqueur but I really think Grand Marnier is the best complement to the white chocolate sort of vanilla and orange together okay that's all chopped up oh this is perfect you want the milk and the cream to be simmering which is little bubbles around the outside okay in goes all this gorgeous chocolate I think there's enough chocolate here I can smell the vanilla the chocolate and just stir it until it melts okay I have to add a few more flavors to this and then I'm going to pack everything up in a big basket and take it over for a great surprise for Joey and Moe I can't wait well it's gorgeous perfectly melted I'm gonna add some great flavor first thing is vanilla bean I'm just gonna take two vanilla beans and slice them up and these are really expensive but it's the holiday so it should be fabulous try and do it without cutting myself these are the seeds just because the holiday I'm going to do two of them I use it for vanilla custards anything that you wanted to have really intense vanilla flavor and also when you want it to look like vanilla that's how it's gonna do I'm gonna add two teaspoons of good vanilla extract this is not the place for artificial in anything and maybe a quarter to a third of a cup of Grand Marnier orange liqueur and the vanilla so good together [Music] okay that's nice and frothy and light I'm just gonna keep it warm and then I'm gonna put a thermos to bring over to their house in the meantime I'm having a big basket with all kinds of holiday goodies chocolate truffles with hazelnuts [Music] should let them all here [Music] cranberry harvest muffins cherry cinnamon granola the champagne is

teamwork this has got to be the work of ina cheers to the holiday that was great
[Music] [Music] I was worried that when I'm away Jeffrey lives on milk and cookies let's be way tonight so I thought I want to stock the fridge with all kinds of delicious things for him to eat and maybe it'll keep them out of the cookie jar first I'm making a delicious beef stew it's easy for him to heat up for dinner whole meal in one pot and because dessert is the best part of the meal I'm making this favored espresso ice cream then for breakfast the next day I'm leaving them homemade cranberry orange scones you can have with this coffee in the morning well helping it doesn't freeze the stew and heat up the ice cream but I'll be calling to find out what he's up to [Music] since Jeffrey's having dinner on his own I thought I'd make some of his favorite things and one of them is definitely ice cream so I'm going to make espresso ice cream it's really good and it has real espresso in it I need three cups of half-and-half she's going to heat the melt until it's called it which means that there's a little lot of bubbles around the outside and there's steam starting to come from it but it's not boiling so I need six egg yolks into the mixer two thirds of a cup of sugar pinch of salt check on the milk looks good you can see line of bubbles around the outside and some steam rising from it okay again sir john i'll show you what it looks like it's amazing to me that egg yolks end up getting so thick like this is that fabulous just egg yolks and sugar a little bit of salt and now on low speed I'm just going to pour the milk slowly into the egg yolks and you want them to keep moving so that you don't cook the egg yolks I got most of it on the counter okay and now i'm going to put all of this back into the pan and cook it very slowly until it thickens this is one of those times you want to stir it constantly until it really thickens then I'm going to flavor with all kinds of delicious things cuff fuel occur and ground espresso and then freeze it and I'm a really good ice cream for Jeffrey this really is one of those things you just have to stand here and stir it the minute you walk away the whole thing just curdles just keep doing this until it gets thick enough to cut the spoon and when you run your finger oh that was hot run your finger down it really leaves the line so it's perfect it's done and now I'm just going to sit it just make sure there's nothing in it that got to thickened that looks gorgeous okay now for the flavorings first one is espresso it's actually ground espresso it's not instant espresso so two and a half tablespoons of ground espresso you can use either regular or decaf tablespoon of coffee liqueur it smells so good and a teaspoon of good banal and just whisk that all together okay that's good I love the way the espresso lips on it okay I'm going to chill it and then later I'm gonna make espresso ice cream I want to make a great big beef stew for Jeffrey and I need rosemary and bay leaves I both in my garden Rosemary's one of my favorite herbs I've always been small fan inside but I want a big plant I've got one outside it's great with lamb and marinades gonna be really good miss beef stew [Music] and now I just need a few bay leaves we're going to marinate the meat for the beef stew and they leaves red wine to be just delicious I actually call this beef stew Parker's beef stew because it was originally made by the chef of barren desert oh so wonderful Parker Hodges so what I've done is I have two and a half pounds of beef it's chuck and I've cut it in cubes you can always have the butcher do it but I prefer to do it myself say end up with sort of regular sized cubes otherwise you have a tiny little pieces and big pieces but you can do that so I'm going to marinate it and that's really what makes Parker's beef stew so delicious three cloves of garlic I'm actually smashed in the cloves of garlic I don't chop them up cuz I don't want to cook them with the beef I wish the map flavor over cooked garlic is not pretty mmm it really releases all the oil okay that's one and I'm going to put in maybe two or three fresh bay leaves and this is the good part a whole bottle of red wine something like a Cabernet Sauvignon so I'm going to marinate the beef in this red wine but I'm also going to use it when I took the sauce okay just stir it all up you I can already smell the flavor so that's a red wine flavor and the garlic so I'm gonna marinate this for a few hours but you can certainly do it overnight it only gets better [Music] so I'm ready to make the beef stew i marinated the beef for a few hours now what I'm going to do is drain it but I want to save the marinade cuz when these later for cooking roll it around that seasoned flour and then saute it in olive oil okay so I've got lots of great vegetables I've taken onions and chopped them up and I have a pound of carrots just going to cut big chunks I like what it looks like big chunks just cut the carrots evenly so that they cook and exactly the same amount of time okay so that's the carrots I'll get carrots onions garlic sun-dried tomatoes potatoes which I'm going to cut them quarters these are great they're Yukon Gold the data so they're sort of that buttery yellow if there's small potatoes cut them in half if they're big cut them in quarters and you don't even have to peel them and the last thing is a half a pound of mushrooms just cut the stems just slice them in half this is a great thing to make for parties first of all I think people really expect something more elegant for a party and they're just thrilled to have beef stew but the second thing is it really sits very well it just tastes better it the longer it sits okay that's all the vegetables that looks great wonder how the beasts doing Oh perfect just going to turn each piece so brands evenly used to have to be that you cook stew for four or five hours until it was really tender because the chuck was very tough but I think meat is much tenderer now that equality and so two or three hours in the evidence will be delicious okay that's done it smells wonderful you really smell the wine that the marinade and view than the sea okay I'm just a little more oil and I'm going to cook all the vegetables and potatoes it's really hot be really careful it's hot the onions it's too large onions just saw TVs for about 10 minutes so they start to brown sautéing the vegetables gives them so much flavor and also because they're going to pick up the beef flavor from the pan so this is the marinade that the beef k matta so strain it vegetables are done so I'm going to put the garlic into the sauté pan and sauté the garlic I put it in the last minute so it doesn't burn this smells so good the carrots and onions and potatoes and now the garlic just wonderful just don't want to hurry you want the onions to be really thoroughly cooked and then take this whole thing and pour it into the pot that's going in the oven just dump it mmm what is that some oak red ok now I'm going to deglaze the pan two and a half cups of the marinade and it's so wine that's going to do that and just scrape up any brown bits that are in the pan because that's really what's going to flavor the sauce ok just going to pour that into the our pot kinda nice and clean the kidnap mmm that's what make a really nice sauce ok now more things to flavor the sauce two cups of chicken stock I always have some in the freezer two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce gives it real depth of flavor one tablespoon of salt sounds like a lot but it's a lot of beef stew two teaspoons of pepper and then to give it lots of flavor half a cup of sun-dried tomatoes and one sprig of fresh rosemary well this goes really wonderful the rosemary into the stock and then just mix it up a little bit this is gonna be so good all the flavors are going to Mel together potatoes and carrots and onions sun-dried tomatoes and the sauce and be so delicious into the oven 304 two to three hours and the beat is going to be so tender vegetables are going to be cooked in the sauce is gonna be so wonderful time to freeze the espresso ice cream that looks so good it's nice and called and this is the insert for the ice cream machine comes out of the freezer so it's really cold just going to pour this in and love that you can see the espresso went out and I'm going to chill this in the ice cream machine until it's almost frozen with this insert in secret mission turn it on it's going to freeze until it's almost hard and just before I put it into the freezer I'm going to turn up the flavor with chopped chocolate covered espresso beans how good does that sound [Music] I'm crushing a chocolate-covered espresso beans to put in my coffee ice cream for Jeffrey he's going to really love this these are actually very cool because it's chocolate it's going to hold espresso bean right in the middle so good if you can't find them you can always find coffee flavored beans that you chopped up but something that has a little crunch like that it's really wonderful and the chocolate and the coffee together is particularly great and I'm just going to put it right in it'll mix in with the ice cream who is that going to be good okay it never freezes really hard in the ice cream freezer so I was like to put it into the freezer to freeze completely it needs at least an hour in the freezer to get the consistency of ice cream okay so I'm going to put it into a container and put it in the freezer does not look gorgeous which everybody save some of this for me it looks really good okay into the freezer and he's gonna have espresso ice cream for dinner well I'm almost home and mine is the wait for the evening he will typically leave me a ton of food in the refrigerator it's really tough being mr. Gordon some of that two or three hours the Sioux should be ready it smells so good in here oh that's a lot oh that looks just fabulous we're just going to make sure the meats done justjust it with a fork if it's tender it's done and when this sauce looks looks freedom is he actually I'm going to put one package of frozen peas in I'm just going to let them defrost and just cook in let us do the next thing i want to make for him is a little something for breakfast so i'm from the oven from 300 to 400 degrees then i'm going to make cranberry orange scones he's going to be really spoiled i'm going to start with 4 cups of flour according to cup of sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder it looks really nice little mind kitschy spoons of salt makes a lot of scones mix it together chip is pearl orange zest it's just cost great can't make scones with that butter so it's got three quarters of a pound of butter just want very very cold butter what a cubed reason why you um cold butter is because you wanted to stay together so when it goes into the oven and the heat hits the butter the water makes this going pop up and get nice light flaky scones okay three comes a pound of butter I'm just going to turn the mixer on low and just mix it until the butter is really about the size of peas okay next thing I need is for eggs it's going to beat them up we want to make sure all the ingredients are really cold so the butter stays called and a cup of heavy cream ok it's just the size of people it's going to make it very wet dough but a good ok now I'm going to add some cranberries but I quarter of a cup of dried cranberries quarter of a cup of flour to make sure they mix nicely through the mixture dried cranberries are better than fresh cranberries fresh grandpa's old too hard for this ok and then slowly put them in so they get mixed into the dough Thanks it's alive oh just a good thing about these scones is they can sit in the refrigerator for a while before I baked them and I can freeze the dough and bake them off as I need them ok it was great I can smell the orange see the cranberry ok I like she's rolling silver flower it a little bit roll it out to Beth well maybe about three quarters of an inch to an inch thick and handle it as little as possible so the butter doesn't melt I'm going to do around so that's about three quarters of an inch sheet pan lined with parchment paper and just are just brush the tub quickly with lightly with a little egg wash it gives them a really nice brown color just sprinkle a little sugar just a nice shine okay into the oven 20 to 25 minutes 400 degrees and Jeffrey's gonna have a really good breakfast [Music] and I'm going to make the rest of the stones of free [Music] so the cranberry orange goes are cooled more is looking for ways to give everything more flavor so I thought why don't I make an orange glaze for them it's really simple half a cup of confectioner's sugar a little bit of orange juice and lifters al on top [Music] probably about three teaspoons and before just want to thick enough so it's a glaze but thin enough so I can pour it if you get it too thick you can have a little more juice if you get it to the fins you can just add a little more confectioner sugar actually love the way it looks it's on so it should be just about that consistency thick but you can pour it ok little drizzle of the scones I some scones left over I'm going to freeze the dough and then I'm going to bake them off before I want to serve them and then once they're cooled she was living with orange plays extra these are cool spoon just like that I take Jeffers can have very nice breakfast okay I'm off no for Jeffrey why do I think he's gonna start on the ice cream gotta go hello hi sweetie oh just great are you

four or five hours until it was really tender because the chuck was very tough but I think meat is much tenderer now that equality and so two or three hours in the
[Music] my friend Michael grooms having a really hectic day today so I've invited him for dinner tonight this is the time for good old-fashioned comfort food Michael actually grew up in a farm in Pennsylvania I understand as long as a fabulous cook so I know it's exactly what he's gonna want to eat I think I'll make oven fried chicken which is all crispy on the outside and juicy inside mashed potatoes with sour cream old-fashioned hearts of lettuce and tomatoes with blue cheese dressing and for dessert good old deep-dish apple pie it sounds pretty comforting to me [Music] so traditionally there are two problems with fried chicken one is all that grease i'm the second one is you have to do it just before you serve it I'm going to show you how to do it the oven solves both those problems first thing you sit it up on this little rear end take your knife and there's a backbone here that I'm gonna take out and you want to run your knife right along both sides of that backbone keep your fingers out of the way okay that's the backbone not great in fried chicken fabulous and soup so I'll save it for later so then you want to have the chicken flat out like this and there's this little part in the breastbone just want to make it with your knife and then run your fingers down both sides of this little bone and then pull it right out just should come out in one fell swoop okay and now it's really easy to cut up just run your knife right down the back flip it over cut the leg from the white meat cut the legs on the side just pull it back it's easy to see where the bones connect so I've got 8 pieces I'm ready for fried chicken now I'm gonna put all the chicken in One Bowl and I'm gonna pour buttermilk over it and it's gonna tenderize it the acid and the buttermilk really makes the chicken very tender and a poor quart of buttermilk over it this is good for two chickens but I only have one so what you want to do is get the buttermilk in them around the chicken parts okay wash up [Music] okay I'm gonna marinate this for a few hours but if you have overnight it's even better I have such a busy day today so many places to go the rain since to do the saving grace is dinner at Ines tonight all I'm gonna do is sit down and eat they're set to go [Music] in the world of comfort food I don't think there's anything more comforting or deep-dish apple pie so I've got the apples and look gorgeous from the farm and now I'm just gonna make pie crust I don't know why but I think people find pie crust more daunting than anything else that we make I'm going to show you the secret of really good pie crust and it's about very cold ingredients so I'm going to start with 3 cups of flour for the shortening there's all kinds of debates all kind of shortening to use for pie crust but I actually combine vegetable shortening and I do it very cold to consider the refrigerator and butter and then you get all of the flakiness of the vegetable shortening and all the flavor of the butter so that's a third of a cup of vegetable shortening and I've wanted to have sticks of cold butter that I've diced and I actually put it back in the refrigerator until I was ready so it's really cold put that right in and now comes the critical part what you want in the dough is little bits of butter and shortening through the dough you don't want to totally pureed and that's what makes it flaky when the heat from the oven hits the butter it causes steam to evaporate and that's what makes it really flaky so when you're doing this make sure it's not totally pureed in the flour I'm just going to pulse this about 8 times until it's like the size of peas maybe 10 times so you can still see bits of butter and shortening in the flour and that's what's gonna make really flaky pastry I'm gonna do maybe one more okay so the next thing is ice water and I need about eight tablespoons which is about 1/2 a cup so we pour out the ice excellent so I'm going to turn this on and just let it go run until it forms a ball okay we're there so now I'm gonna refrigerate it for about 30 minutes it's a really important part of making good pie pastry really careful this thing is sharp put it in the fridge for 30 minutes which gives me time to make my really old-fashioned blue cheese dressing with tomatoes and hearts of lettuce my friend Michaels having a really hard day and I thought I'd make them a very old-fashioned dinner starting with lettuce and tomato with blue cheese dressing so I have four ounces of Roquefort blue cheese 1 cup of mayonnaise this is gonna make a lot of blue cheese dressing but it's good to have around a cup of cream since the blue cheese is kind of sweet a little vinegar 2 teaspoons of tarragon vinegar are gonna give it a little bit of a bite which is good 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper how easy is that can just puree it you don't want to pureed a little chunky nice I just got a phone call from a client last-minute dinner party so she needs flowers and I'm trying to rescue her I feel like the flying doctor of flower [Music] okay now for the filling and teach - apple pie four pounds of apples cut up in big chunks and I'm gonna flavor it with a little bit of orange zest and lemon zest one tablespoon of orange juice and two tablespoons of lemon juice this not only flavors it but it keeps the apples were turning brown half a cup of sugar it all depends on how sweet the apples are these are pretty tart quarter cup of flour and teaspoon of salt I know it's surprising to put salt in a pie but it really brings out the flavor of the spices in the apples okay now for the spices three Carozza bautista the good cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon who couldn't up Meg hmm I love the way it smells smells like apple pie spice is already okay eighth of a teaspoon of allspice we're just really a pinch I'm just gonna mix it all up now if that doesn't look like old-fashioned home cooking I don't know what does I'd say this is gonna make Michael feel all better [Music] obviously these here perfect hi Peggy everything [Music] this is the key to rolling out dough is you start from the middle and work your way out I also keep it moving you don't want to roll out a perfect circle and then you can't get it up off the stone not a good idea this is a really great pie dough for any kind of pie pecan pie pumpkin pie apple pie okay that should be good so the easiest way to get into the pie plate let's take the dough roll it right up around the rolling pin and then just ease it in this is next really important step don't stretch the dough if you stretch the dough if you pull it into the pie pan when it hits the heat it's going to shrink right back so push it and sort of press it in into the form so you don't stretch it at all and just in case of tears just take a little bit of water on your fingers and press it right back together again it'll be just fine okay that's the bottom crust and then right into the crust it's a lot of apples for this pie crust but I like it when it's piled high mile high apple pie okay now for the top crust [Music] ready for the pie roll it up on the rolling pin [Music] and I'll really gently over you there's so many different ways to crimp a pie I think everybody likes to do with the way their mother did it but what I like to do is just roll the top crust underneath the bottom one I want to make this really old-fashioned looking okay once that's done you can either to crimp it with a fork crimping is about keeping the two crusts together so it seals in the juices or you can do it with your fingers I think I'll do it with my fingers yeah okay crimped now I'm gonna do an egg wash it's gonna make the crust really nice and brown which is one egg beaten with about a tablespoon of water or milk or whatever you have just brush the whole top okay a little bit of sugar make it nice and shiny and then just a few holes on the top to let the steam escape so the crust gets nice and crisp sort of old-fashioned okay into the oven 400 degrees for about an hour and hour and fifteen minutes really good with oven fried chicken and sour cream mashed potatoes time to fry the chicken so I've got my chicken there's marinating in buttermilk which is gonna make it moist and really tender it's that first thing I'm gonna season some flour to make the coating it's gonna make it really crisp 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of fresh pepper like I'm just gonna mix it all together and then put the chicken in so the secret of this recipe is instead of frying the chicken while everybody's standing there waiting for dinner I'm gonna fry it really quickly get the coating really crisp and then I'm gonna bake it in the oven so it's gonna be crisp on the outside an incredibly tender and juicy on the inside it's a messy job but really worth doing okay last piece you're really messy okay now let's get some oil really hot need the oil about 360 degrees use a candy thermometer which really save hangs on the pot think it's almost there okay chicken in just about three minutes on each side just remember where you finish cooking it in the oven they're browned on one side I want to turn them for another three minutes and then put them on a sheet pan to bake in the oven no one likes fried chicken snip for the flour I just use salt and pepper cuz I like it simple but you can always use something spicy like fan pepper whatever you like little chili powder okay three minutes ready to come out and go on the sheet then I'm gonna fry the rest of these up then I'm gonna put them all in the oven together for engine 50 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until they're incredibly crisp on the outside and really juicy inside okay they're ham can you get through Oh gotta go now that's an apple pie my favorite part is it makes the house smell fabulous so next thing I want to make is sour cream mashed potatoes I peeled them and cut them in big chunks I put them in salted boiling water for maybe about 10 to 15 minutes okay next thing I want to do is heat up a little bit of milk and butter I only have two cups of milk 6 tablespoons of butter and meanwhile I'm gonna get the potatoes pureed so this is called a food mill you can really find it in a hardware store or any kind of a cookware store and it's not very expensive so I'm just going to put the potatoes in I'll show you how this food mill work so just turn the blade and you can turn it backwards just to clean the blade and then turn it again see how light and fluffy it doesn't bother I can use any kind of boiling potatoes but Yukon Gold which are a little yellow which these are are the best ones done okay I'm just gonna whisk this into the potatoes just do it slowly don't do all of it at once want to make sure that you have enough so that's creamy but not so much that it's soupy you know a potato soup okay now for a little depth of flavor better half a cup of sour cream two teaspoons of salt [Music] really good Michael's gonna be very happy camper this is going to be really delicious without them for our chicken so all I'd love to do is plate up the salad so I've got blue cheese dressing and I'm gonna make a really nice salad so I mean traditionally this is done with a wedge of iceberg lettuce which is totally tasteless so I've taken a really nice head of lettuce just gonna take the outside leaves off save them for another salad so I think I'm just gonna cut this whole thing in I'm just gonna rinse it so there's no sand shake it out and since this piece is really too big to get into a salad spinner and you want it pretty dry I'll show you how how else to do it wrap it up into the kitchen towel and make your own salad spinner if you do this outside you won't get the kitchen so wet but it's just water okay let me get some plates I mean plates are great for a salad in it look it look terrific okay so instead of the usual sort of plastic tomatoes that you get in the grocery store I'd love to find heirloom tomato so it's sort of old fashioned see it's so much more flavor so few Tomatoes the bigger ones cut in half or quarters just an assortment of yellow and orange and green tomatoes and blue cheese dressing and I'd be all ready when Michael gets you [Music] are you gonna be happy just like your mother's cooking oven fried chicken sour cream mashed potatoes and to start blue cheese salad with heirloom tomatoes yes [Music] perfect [Music] first piece in my house smells wonderful but cooked apples and nutmeg and cinnamon I could smell the orange zest and lemon zest I don't know anything a little vanilla ice cream doesn't improve [Music] [Music]
[Music] Antonia Bellanca and I have been dear friends for decades she's coming today with her gorgeous daughter Tess who at 14 years old is already a professional Baker Tess and I have actually been baking together since she was five I like to think I had a little influence on her for dinner I'm making fresh crab cakes that are packed with flavor and instead of the usual coleslaw a French celery root remoulade then for dessert I'm getting ingredients ready for a lemon meringue tart so Tess and I can pipe the meringue topping together I'm always in the kitchen cooking on my own I'm so excited to have Test cooking with me and hey I might even send her home with a new baking skill my friends Antonian test live in Cape Cod and I thought it'd be great to make crab cakes for dinner make them feel right at home so I'm gonna saute them in butter and oil the key to crab cakes is lots of flavor I don't like crab cakes that are just like crab and mayonnaise it has to have lots of flavor and I do it by having wonderful vegetables so what I'm going to do is saute all these vegetables the other thing about crab cakes since the crab is quite expensive this really makes it go much further so I'm just gonna put these in the oil and butter I've got about 3/4 of a cup of red onion we're gonna 1/2 cups of celery half a cup of yellow peppers sweet yellow peppers and I got a half a cup of red peppers I'd really prefer red and yellow peppers I think they're sweeter than green peppers I just saute those for about 15 minutes until they're really just tender and be colorful and flavorful okay now I need some parsley 1/4 cup of chopped parsley a rough chop is just fine doesn't have to be the most perfect chopped parsley in the world okay that's about quarter of a cup mmm no more flavors I need tablespoon of capers want drained capers you don't want the liquid in it half a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce quarter of a teaspoon of Tabasco give it a little heat and why don't have teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning which is a great sort of crabcakes seasoning mixture you can really find anywhere in a grocery store salt and pepper can never forget salt and pepper that half a teaspoon of each I'm just gonna cook this for about 10 minutes until the vegetables are really tender I'm gonna add the crabmeat and lots of other good stuff [Music] [Applause] so with the crabcakes it's really traditional in my coleslaw but I thought it'd be much better to make celery remoulade but summer wood is that big ugly knob is a kind of celery not the kind we usually get it's kind of bitter and you can see the sort of stalks but it's grown just for the root and has a really fresh sort of celery like flavor so it's but it's a tough root as you can see cutting it so what I'm doing is I'm going to shred it so that the course grading yes you see how fast this is when you do it this way much easier than doing by hand just have to cut these so that the fit in the feed tube if you press on the top things maybe that a course are great which is terrific last piece if you have a little piece left over you can always grade it by hand so that was about a two pound celery root I actually love celery where it's great with mashed potatoes and Gretchen's got a really fresh flavor so I'm just gonna add some salt to this about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons and some fresh lemon juice and that'll keep it from turning brown and sort of marinated a little bit which is great 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and just let it sit while I make the sauce so I need mustard and vinegar when I use mustard I often use two of them like Dijon mustard because it's got real punch and I like coarse grain mustard because I like the texture and it looks like mustard and ooh champagne vinegar but any good white wine vinegar will be just fine okay necklace sauce really easy we do a cup of mayonnaise I was like when mayonnaise is thin with lots of other flavorings so just now that sort of thick texture but it also has lots of flavor of Dijon mustard a tablespoon of course mustard about two teaspoons of the vinegar to get a little see how great this looks it looks like it's yellow with mustard but also the coarse mustard really gives it the texture I think a little bit of lemon juice better tablespoon so now the sauce is already okay just pour enough sauce over it I always have extra sauce because sometimes it gets dry as it sits pour enough sauce over salt and pepper mix it together oh this is gonna be delicious I love celery root lemon juice and mustard together a little more sauce okay this is nicely mixed who's gonna refrigerate it nicely delicious with the crab cakes which I want to finish next [Music] time to mix up the crabcakes let's start with a half a pound of crab meat instead of picking the crabs just buy it like this it's really good make sure it's fresh if you can rather than frozen always better fantastic this looks really beautiful lump crabmeat just check and make sure there are no little sort of shells in it crab cakes are so great for kids I know a lot of kids that won't he broiled halibut but they all like crab cakes so I'm gonna put in all the sauteed vegetables that we've made earlier all the celery and red peppers yellow peppers and red onion is going to be so much flavor and then 1/2 a cup of breadcrumbs just plain breadcrumbs or crying mayonnaise which binds it all together two eggs which also have find it together [Music] fit them lightly right now two teaspoons of good Dijon mustard and just mix it up I think what I want to do it'd be fun for tests to make these crab cakes with when you sound school at this chill in the fridge get nice and firm and then testing on saute them together okay that's nicely nice just looks great okay into the fridge chill for 30 minutes but I think I'm gonna go by Tessa gift she's a fabulous Baker [Music] so for dessert Tess and I are gonna make a lemon meringue tart if I'd be really

my friends Antoni and Tess so I'm gonna make a lemon meringue tart so the first thing I need is one stick of butter one and a half cups of sugar [Music] so I'm going to cream those together and separate four eggs [Music] you scrape it down add the egg yolks and then I'm gonna reserve the egg whites for the meringue later that's on low speed and I'm going to add four whole eggs just get that in until it's incorporated get 3/4 of a cup of fresh lemon juice accord of a cup of the lemon zest that i zested before and that's gonna make it taste so good and a teaspoon of salt just a pinch it's gonna it's gonna look curdled don't get nervous it's the way it's supposed to look okay the lemon zest is what's gonna give it so much flavor [Music] okay I'm just gonna cook it for about eight to ten minutes until it's really thick and smooth and then I'm gonna make meringue and when test comes we're gonna pipe the meringue together that's gonna be really nice yes so my friend test should be here any minute to help me with a lemon meringue tart I'm gonna get the meringue ready for room temperature egg whites you don't get the same volume with cold egg whites those are the egg whites that are from the separated eggs quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar which is like a vinegar that helps stabilize the meringue and a quarter teaspoon of salt and I'm gonna whisk this on high speed until it gets light and fluffy and then add sugar have a cup of sugar and just add it really slowly [Music] this is gonna get really thick and shiny it's gonna be great on the lemon meringue tart and then

I'm making golden roasted Cornish hands so the first thing I'm going to do is my cornbread stuffing for the Cornish em now they have to stick of unsalted butter it's four tablespoons and one cup of chopped onion about half of a large yellow onion I'm just going to cook it for a few minutes until the onions are translucent the next thing I need is one stalk of celery I'm going to dice it and add the celery to the onions and butter so they cook just a little bit visibly 1/2 a cup of chicken stock cornbread stuffing is really classic Thanksgiving thing I like really simple ones but you can always add sausage or chestnuts whatever you like the hard part here is scaling it down so that I can make enough for two Corner shams so I'm just guessing I need about two and a half cups of corn bread crumbs okay so the corn breads all crumbled up then add the celery and onions chicken stock right to the bowl okay a little parsley would be good and maybe a little salt and pepper to taste stir it up make sure the cornbread absorbs all the butter and onions and parsley all the flavor okay time to stuff these guys so these are two Cornish hens and I put them on a bed of onion so the onions cook with the Cornish and and fill each one Cornish hens are really like little chickens so they cook the same way but in less time these guys take about 35 to 40 minutes to cook its had their little legs together the whole point of time with things together is to make sure everything is very tight and it cooks evenly and then just tuck the little wings underneath so they stay tight okay and then order for them to Brown you want the outside to be very dry it's a little paper towel and you can put a little bit of butter or olive oil on the outside it really helps it Brown nicely and keeps it moist salt and pepper okay when to roast the 425 for about 35 to 40 minutes until they're brown on the outside and juicy and tender inside not the smell wonderful and nice set of onions I'm just going to test it see if it's done if you cut between the leg and the thigh and the juices run clear it's done and I'm going to cover a little as well for about 15 minutes it retains all the heat and the juices and the flavors right back into the cornerstone keeps it nice and warm for dinner gorgeous little Cornish hen a little bit of onion and you won't believe how delicious they are [Music]
[Music] my friend Frank has invited some friends to dinner tonight and I'm testing soup recipes all day so I said what are we join forces I'll bring soup to your house for dinner that way he doesn't have to cook and I can rotate as my recipes the first soup is a really hearty lentil soup with spicy sausage and it's sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese the second recipe is a seafood stew that's full of shrimp and chunky fish just like a classic bluey bez but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] some of my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water they dose up for about 15 minutes just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make big pot of soup and put them in and cook so I was with most soups I start with onions I'm just a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions at four cups of leeks it makes a lot of soup I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because you can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months one tablespoon of chopped garlic we're just met three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves I'm just gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good to get it lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and one and a half teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just going to cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup well that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's going to be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is carrots keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually like it to look like it's homemade okay just big days more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just gonna boot cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery I'm going to do it right down the middle I'm Barefoot Contessa we have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery and you'd end up with like 200 quarts of soup it was really good okay so that's the carrots and the celery let me see if onions are ready no they're just simmering way here yeah they're perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender Lise okay now I'm going to add all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be really hard a soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s it was considered like hippie vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown lentils and have more flavor next is chicken stock how my chicken stuck you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken second it's so easy to make so I have three quarts you'll go right in somebody find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens in a pot with some carrots and celery thyme whole peppercorns it's so easy and I'm always in the kitchen for a couple of hours and it just boils away and then you have a really good stock to make soups with I just keep it in the freezer and it's ready whenever I want to make soup okay so that's three quarts of chicken stock and then a quart of a cup of tomato paste gives it a lot of flavor it's surprising and last but not least lentils so this is a pound of lentils that I've soaked for about 15 minutes just pour them all in this is a big pot of soup so we're just going to simmer this for about an hour all the flavors are going to blend together and then it Franks has someone add spicy kielbasa sausage and I'm going to serve it with a drizzle of olive oil red wine and some Parmesan cheese delicious [Music] hmmm chive biscuits I thought they'd be wonderful with my soups thinking biscuits really is a lot like making scones the same sort of process so first I need 2 cups of flour into my mixer the key to both of them is the butter you want it really cold and you want it in big chunks so they stay nice and light and fluffy one tablespoon of baking powder one teaspoon of soft [Music] and once you spill of sugar just a little bit of sweetness in them okay the next thing is butter so once take a very cold butter and we're going to dice it and then put it in the mixer and the mixers can do all the work [Music] okay I'm just going to mix it until the butters about the size of peas okay meantime I need 3/4 of a cup of half-and-half can really make scones with any kind of savory herb like time would be wonderful for Sage maybe for Thanksgiving making with Said's I'd be good with turkey until that's ready on one chop some chives just line them up nice sharp knife hmm smells great it's a really delicate onion flavor it's gonna be good in the biscuits okay got a half a cup who's gonna put it in at the end so it doesn't get all smashed up a really fresh chive flavor okay that looks good I can pour the cream in slowly with a mixer on it's a really wet dough but it's really delicious and the chives okay they're ready to roll out okay flour the board that's a really nice dough I can really smell the chives too it's great good that's sticky this should make better 8-bit biscuits just keep moving around on the board you just want to make sure it doesn't stick and you can pat them out or you can roll the map I was like to roll it looks nice smooth even biscuit I just think it's nice if you have something as simple as soup to have something a little special like homemade bread okay two and a half inch cutter just come out put them on the pan these are great served on their own but they're also absolutely delicious sort of as a little sandwich like a 40 or something I bet than that thing that's great exactly eight okay now I'm going to do a little egg wash make the tops nice and brown and a little bit of half-and-half just whisk it together that easy to do in a small ball okay I'm just gonna brush the top slightly well these are gonna be just delicious with soups okay - like the smell of biscuits 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and when a delicious jive biscuits with our soup [Music] I love a classic French boy abyss but it takes forever to make so instead I'm going to make a seafood stew with all the same flavors shellfish shrimp fish and it's going to be so delicious hi Neil hi how are you I'm good incredible display so I'm making a seafood stew okay can you get me a few things actually there are a lot of kinds of shrimp but why don't I take the clean ones all right so a pound of clean shrimp please and then I can always peel them in devayne them myself but why not get them already done that's a lot of work they - sometime exactly [Music] 24 mussels all right she's a great they are wonderful and I need a pound of halibut delay sure fabulous you and I need a plan to see bass please all right you know there are a few things to look for when you're looking for fish and I think the pretty standard one is that it doesn't smell very fishy and this I mean there's no fish smell here it's amazing and the other is that the eye of the fish is really bright that was really fast thanks so much Neal well it's gonna be great they do thank you enjoy bye-bye [Music] second soup I want to test is seafood stew so the first thing I heat some oil and then cut up some onions two yellow onions oil is hot it's going to put the onions right in next I'm going to do potatoes I need 2 cups of potatoes and these are you kind of go they have lots of flavor next the fennel I love bell it's got that wonderful anise flavor and when it's cooked not that crazy about it raw but when it's cooked it just there's a really delicate flavor so I'm just gonna chop this up this were very porous all flavor and into the soup okay that's it for the fennel two teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of pepper stir it all together let's gonna cook about 15 minutes so the vegetables and the potatoes are all tender in the meantime I need some seafood for the seafood stew [Music] lots of great seafood it's a good stock so first thing I want to do is soak the mussels sometimes have a little sand and the mussels and nobody needs sand in their seafood stew so put them in a bowl fill those water and then a handful of flower in the water just mix it around and what happens is the muscles break the water with the flower and they discourage any of sand that they have inside to leave these to soak and I think seafood stew is ready for a little wine two clips of a nice dry white wine you never cook with anything I wouldn't want to drink and seafood stock you can make it organ by it I need four cups which is a quart it smells good and one twenty ounce can of tomatoes warm right in okay next we want to add some garlic got to have garlic and seafood stew sounds going to chop it out three cloves 3 big cloves of garlic actually add this later in the stew so it doesn't burn okay three cloves of garlic right into the stew and then the truly Provencal ingredient is saffron it's the stamens of crocuses you want to choose really good whole saffron not the powdered Cong and I'm going to add one teaspoon which is all of this they love saffron it really gives a full flavor and a little bit of spice to this do so this is going to just simmer for about 15 minutes while I get the seafood ready so I owe this great fish first want to start with a halibut just slice it in big chunks do is want to choose sort of firm flesh fish it's not going to just disintegrate in this do the second one it's a sea bass [Music] who's going slices across to so you want big enough chunks so then it's just integrate but small enough ones I still actually cooking let's do pretty quickly okay next one we'll rinse the mussels first I'm just going to check and see if any of them are open permanently Simmons they're not alive and they all look gorgeous so they're fun it's gonna risk me a few times to make sure there's no flour perfect ok the last things the shrimp before my glad I got this peeled and deveined so much work okay I think the students just about ready for the seafood well this looks pretty good okay lots of fish stir it in it's going to cook really fast now mix the shrimp [Music] this looks so chunky and delicious full of flavors okay last the muscles I love the color and the texture the snake let alone the flavor it's gonna cook in about five minutes all the fish and the shrimp and mussels are gonna be done and then

doesn't stick I love a classic French boy abyss but it takes forever to make so instead I'm going to make a seafood stew with all the same flavors shellfish shrimp fish and it's going to be so delicious hi Neil hi how are you I'm good incredible display Wow so I'm making a seafood stew can you get me a few things actually a lot of kinds of shrimp but why don't I take the clean ones all right so a pound of clean shrimp please and then I can always peel them into vein them myself but why not get them already done it's a lot of work stay tuned sometime exactly [Music] 24 muscles all right it's a break you're wonderful and I need a pound of halibut delay sure fabulous and I need a plan to seabass please all right you know there are a few things to look for when you're looking for fish and I think they're pretty standard one is that it doesn't smell very fishy and this I mean there's no fish smell here it's amazing and the other is that the eye of the fish is really bright that was really fast thanks so much Neal well it's gonna be great here they do thank you enjoy bye bye [Music] second soup I want to test is seafood stew so the first thing I heat some oil and then cut up some onions two yellow onions oil is hot it's going to put the onions right in next I'm going to do potatoes I need 2 cups of potatoes and these are you kind go they have lots of flavor next the fennel I love bell it's got that wonderful anise flavor and when it's cooked not that crazy bet it raw but when it's cooked it just is a really delicate flavor so I'm just gonna chop this up this we're very poor lasalle flavor and into the city okay that's it for the fennel two teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of pepper you stir it all together that's going to cook about 15 minutes so the vegetables and the potatoes are all tender in the meantime I need some seafood for the seafood stew [Music] lots of great seafood seafood stock so first thing I want to do is soak the mussels sometimes a little sand and the mussels and nobody needs sand in their seafood stew so them in a bowl fill it with water and then a handful flour in the water just mix it around and what happens is the mussels break the water with the flour and they discourage any of sand that they have inside to leave these to soak and I think seafood stew is ready for a little wine two clips of a nice dry white wine you never cook with anything I wouldn't want to drink and seafood stock you can make it organ by it I need four cups which is a quart it smells good and one twenty ounce can of plum tomatoes form right in okay next I'm going to add some garlic gotta have garlic and seafood stew sounds going to chop it up three cloves 3 big cloves of garlic actually add this later in the stew so it doesn't burn okay three cloves of garlic right into the stew and then the truly Provencal ingredient is saffron it's the stamens of crocuses you want to choose really good whole saffron not the powdered con and I'm going to add one teaspoon which is all of this I love saffron it really gives a full flavor and a little bit of spice to this do so this is kind of just simmer for about 15 minutes while I get the seafood ready so all this great fish first we're gonna start with a halibut just blast it in big chunks you always want to choose sort of firm flesh fish it's not gonna just disintegrate in this do ii wanted to see that i'm whole peppercorns it's so easy and I'm always in the kitchen for a couple of hours and it just boils away and then you have a really good stock to make soups with I just keep it in the freezer and it's ready whenever I want to make soup okay so that's three quarts of chicken stock and then a quarter of a cup of tomato paste gives it a lot of flavor it's surprising and last but not least lentils so this is a pound of lentils that I've soaked for about 15 minutes just pour them all in this is a big pot of soup so we're just going to simmer this for about an hour all the flavors are going to blend together and then it Franks has someone add spicy cabassa sausage and I'm going to serve it with a drizzle of olive oil red wine and some Parmesan cheese delicious [Music] hmmm chive biscuits I thought they'd be wonderful with my soups making biscuits really is a lot like making scones the same sort of process so first I need 2 cups of flour into my mixer the key to both of them is the butter you want it really cold and you want it in big chunks so that they stay nice and light and fluffy one tablespoon of baking powder one teaspoon of salt [Music] and once he's put a sugar just a little bit of sweetness in them okay the next thing is butter so once take a very cold butter and we're going to dice it and then put it in the mixer and the mixers can do all the work [Music] okay I'm just going to mix it until the butter is about the size of peas okay meantime I need 3/4 of a cup of half-and-half can really make scones with any kind of savory herb like time would be wonderful or sage maybe for Thanksgiving make them look Said's I'd be good with Turkey until that's pretty much up some chives let's line them up nice sharp knife hmm smells great it's a really delicate onion flavor it's gonna be good in the distance okay kind of half a cup we're gonna put it in at the end so it doesn't get all smashed up a really fresh chive flavor okay that looks good I can pour the cream in slowly with a mixer on it's a really wet dough but it's really delicious and the chives okay they're ready to roll out okay flour the board this is a really nice do you really smell the chives - it's great good and sticky this should make that 8-foot biscuits just keep moving around on the board you just want to make sure it doesn't stick and you can pat them out or you can roll the mat I was like to roll it that's nice smooth even biscuit I just think it's nice if you have something as simple as soup to have something a little special like homemade bread okay two and a half inch cutter just come out let them up and these are great served on their own but they're also absolutely delicious sort of as a little sandwich like a 40 or something how bad can that be that's great exactly eight okay now I'm going to do a little egg wash make the tops nice and brown and a little bit of half-and-half just whisk it together that easy to do with a small ball I'm just gonna brush the top slightly well these are gonna be just delicious with soups okay I feel like the smell of biscuits 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and when a delicious chive biscuits with our soup you [Music] my friend Frank has invited some friends to dinner tonight and I'm testing soup recipes all day so I said why don't we join forces I'll bring soup to your house for dinner that way he doesn't have to cook and I can road test my recipes the first soup is a really hearty lentil soup with spicy sausage and it's sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese the second recipe is a seafood stew that's full of shrimp and chunky fish just like a classic bluey bez but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] two of my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water they dose up for my 15 minutes just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make big pot of soup and put them in and cook so I was with most soups I start with onions I'm just a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions that's four cups of leeks it makes the latter suit I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because it can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months one tablespoon of chopped garlic we're just about three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves I'm just gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good to get it lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just going to cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup well that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's gonna be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is Karis keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually liked it to look like it's homemade okay just big dice more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just going to cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery I'm just going to do it right down the middle at Barefoot Contessa we have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery and you'd end up with like 200 quarts of soup but it's really good okay so that's the carrots in the celery let me see if bones are ready no they're just simmering away here yeah they're perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender leaves okay now I'm gonna end all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be a really hearty soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s it was considered like hippy vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown lentils and they have more flavor next is chicken stock I'll make chicken stock you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken second it's so easy to make so I have three quarts which is gonna go right in somehow I find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens and a pot with some carrots and celery
[Music] my friends Billy Finkelstein and his wife Barbara coming to dinner tonight he's an LA screenwriter and she's a fabulous architect you know I know those guys in LA only have frozen yogurt and water for dinner I don't think so instead I'm making it over-the-top three-course meal for them and making pomegranate cosmos that are a delicious twist on an old favorite and to go with them salty fingerling potatoes to dip in the garlicky French aioli and then for dinner not one but two blue cheese soufflés I have a foolproof recipe and for dessert spicy apple turnovers that look fancy but they're really easy to make these guys are actually serious foodie so I've got my work cut out everybody always says they don't want to have to serve but I don't remember anybody turning it down in my house one of the reasons I think is because I really make traditional desserts sometimes I'll make them in a different way like this time I'm gonna make apple turnovers which are apple tarts when I'm doing them in puff pastry so the first thing I'm going to start with us three apples so I usually pick a fairly tart apple this granny smith apples but if you want to mix them sometimes that's nice during apple season you can get something like a mccune or a Empire Apple so three granny smith apples chopped up and then right away I want to put something acidic on there so they don't turn brown so I'm going to use some orange that a teaspoon of grated orange zest and three tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice that's about half an orange three tablespoons of sugar these are chart apples over a little sweetness one tablespoon of flour Creve teaspoon of cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg okay toss that together and then I'm gonna use dried cherries should be really good so the tartness of the cherries and the apples a really good balance for each other about three tablespoons okay just a pinch of salt I know it's surprising but it makes a big difference it's actually a good idea at this point to just taste it and just make sure it tastes right mmm just just like apple pie okay that's the filling I know I'm gonna make the pastry if times I feel like make my own pie crust and times I just don't this is one of those times and the good news is it doesn't make any difference it's gonna be really delicious so I'm gonna use a frozen puff pastry this is the layers and layers of layers of dough and butter and when you put it in the oven it puffs up and it's really nice and light so just gonna roll it lightly until it's 12 by 12 just make sure it's well floured just don't want it to stick to the board you won't be sure it stays really cold [Music] this sure beats making pie crust doesn't it okay 12 by 12 we're there [Music] so I'm going to cut this in quarters little bit of filling in each one so I'm just gonna put a little egg wash on all the edges and then when I crimp it it'll seal it should I have this works just fold it right over take the fork you just crimp the edges the way you would with the pie crust these are gonna get nice and brown sort of a golden-brown color and they're gonna be just gorgeous right on the pan just like that okay I'm just gonna finish the rest best thing is I can make this early in the day and just bake them before from serving them so we have nice hot apple turnovers these are pretty good [Music] and a little sprinkling of sugar and a little split to win it the steam when they bake okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake them off when my guests are here the whole house is gonna smell like apple pie i Michael arranger for dinner party of very chic friends coming so will you look in the fridge with me I need some inspiration got a problem okay not orange orange I had this idea that I want to do like a deconstructed French bouquet so maybe like white there's so many white and lime-green flowers but to do like a Vaz of each one individually and then I can just move them around on the table does that sound like it's not beautiful that does okay great so I know I need alchemy 'la maybe 20 steps perfect okay so how about a white half speed white lilac they're so beautiful white leather and wipe the lisianthus that would be pretty okay cool those two bubbles these okay that looks good that looks good an elysian yes oh this would be really pretty these the one in green and white parrot is a little touch of pink yeah beautiful I'll take these right too low it's gonna be gorgeous it's gonna be absolutely gorgeous we're gonna Mack a man whoa I think we have enough flowers one table [Music] my friends are coming for dinner and you gotta have cocktails I'm gonna make pomegranate Cosmopolitan's and the first thing I'm doing is getting those glasses ice-cold so this is really a traditional recipe very la Cosmopolitan's but with a twist and instead of doing it with cranberry juice I'm making them with pomegranate juice which is really good so the first thing I need is two cups of vodka I'm gonna make a lot at one time I hate making cocktails one at a time I'm just gonna pour them in a pitcher and then when my friends come we'll just shake them up with ice one cup of orange liqueur one cup of pomegranate juice I know it sounds unusual but you really can't find it and it's actually good for you can you imagine causing problems that are good for you and the last ingredient is half a cup of freshly squeezed lime juice it's a really important use fresh lime juice not a bottle to the variety just has that sort of very fresh kind of flavor [Applause] I remember the first time I had a cousin problem I thought wow that's serious I'm very used to them have a cup of freshly squeezed lime juice and that's it it's a nice big pitcher and then later when my friends come I'm gonna shake it up with ice and we're in a really good cosmopolitan I'm going to serve it with fingerling potatoes and dipped in aisle 8 how good is that [Music] well potatoes with eyerly are sort of a classic Provencal side dish but I thought wouldn't it be nice to have them for hors d'oeuvres a little bit of I only as a dip so what I have is fingerling potatoes to these wonderful incredibly hot Wow potatoes and I just like to cut them in half I'm gonna make an aioli dip I boil them for about 10 minutes and then I find it they cook so much better if I take them out before they're totally done and let them steam under a covered cloth for about 15 minutes so now for the I Olli I love this it's got so much flavor so what I'm gonna do is I've got one piece of bread this is used as a thickener for the i-league I'm just gonna tear it up into a bowl and add about two tablespoons of champagne or white wine vinegar and just let it soak for a few minutes and in the meantime I'll make the rest of it so garlic lots of it six big cloves of garlic and just chop it up it seems like every dish in Provence has lots of garlic in it it's so good okay into the food processor two egg yolks okay next thing is lemon juice and lemon zest I think it really adds a nice freshness to the aisle a half teaspoon of grated lemon zest okay got a half a teaspoon three tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice it's a little less than one large lemon what okay perfect half a teaspoon of saffron the stamens of crocuses and it's just so wonderful and okay one teaspoon of salt quarter of teaspoon of pepper and then we're going to do is take the bread that I've soaked it's gooey but it's gonna be good in the eye Olie just squeeze as much of the liquid out as you can perfect and I'm gonna puree the whole thing together and then just like with mayonnaise I'm gonna pour olive oil and slowly so it gets very thick I need one and a half cups of olive oil this is actually not the time for really strongly flavored olive oil I'm using pure olive oil rather than extra-virgin so I'm a little bit of olive flavor but not overwhelming and then just like with manna it's just pour it in really slowly and you see it gets very thick smell all the garlic and [Music] that looks good it's wonderful and really good a hit of garlic and lemon and the saffron should be really good with potatoes okay I'm just gonna clean up a bit I can really make a mess we're the aioli and to the ball this look gorgeous I love the color or to the egg yolks and that saffron and then I'm just gonna do potatoes right around the outside now that could this be hasn't pollens fingerling potatoes and I only needs dinner [Music] I'm gonna spray it with a little salt no pepper see how much more flavorful it looks and I was like to do a little chopped chive on it just think the green really has something to it and it is a little flavor too so chopped chive it looks great and it's delicious I think I might have to try one just to make sure it's okay it's so good the potato and the eye all the way together they're gonna really enjoy this with this and a blue cheese souffle and we'll have dinner ready [Music] so for the main course I'm gonna make blue cheese souffle not one but two I have to say I used to think it was a really scary thing to do but I tested it over and over again it's really foolproof okay so I have ten egg whites and eight egg yolks and these I'm just gonna stay for another time and lots of blue cheese I actually love to use good work for for this he's gonna chop it up if you like blue cheese you will love this souffle I just adore it okay blue cheese is ready I need two cups of milk heated should be that right what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a roux which is like a white sauce and then add the blue cheese and then just before serving I'm gonna whip up the egg whites put them in the oven people go crazy so I've got 6 tablespoons of butter melted and then need 6 tablespoons of flour so just sprinkle it on the butter I just want to cook the butter and flour for a minute or two it just really gets rid of that raw flour taste okay that's ready now and then Memphis hot butter pour hot milk into the so it combines pretty quickly I'm just gonna cook this for a minute until it's really thick it's the time whisk really helps pull it together well that's thick and I'm gonna add some seasonings so a pinch of nutmeg pinch of cayenne pepper teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper okay that looks great now off the heat you're gonna add 8 egg yolks just one at a time just whisk the limb this really makes a nice lunch or really like dinner just a wonderful thing he makes souffles all kinds of things on the chicken crab needs but I have to admit my favorite is blue cheese okay then the blue cheese I'm just gonna put it in and it's gonna just melt into the base and I have a cup of Parmesan cheese [Music] just stir that in and the cheese's will melt into the base okay I'm gonna pour this into two bowls and make two souffles out okay now for the egg whites so I have ten egg whites at room temperature it's really important for this quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar which helps them really hold their shape I think you saw and just turn it on high and listen as high as you can [Music] because otherwise they never get the volume might even clean up while they listen this is perfect I want the egg whites so they're really firm but not over whip so they're dry and I'm going to take the egg whites and do half in each Bowl there's a nice and light from the key to this is to fold it in without deflating the egg whites as much as possible so a sort of classic folding method is to cut down the middle of it and then fold your spatula and that and just keep turning it and turning it until you get a homogeneous mixture without deflating the egg whites too much I think this is the part that used to make me nervous but now that I've done them so many times it really is fairly foolproof so what I have is two souffle dishes and I've greased the inside and dusted it with Parmesan cheese okay that's one I'm gonna make the other one I don't know why I used to think it was so scary it's really not please go into a 400-degree oven I'm gonna turn it down immediately to 375 30 to 35 minutes and we will have to core just souffles wait till they come out they're gonna be amazing I'm setting a timer I don't want to forget these can't wait [Music] my friends are coming to dinner and I always feel like I've got a handle on the food but the table setting I'm never quite sure about so what I've done is I've gotten lime green and white flowers I'm gonna do table setting in just those colors so I'm going to do five roses with five different lime and green flowers so that's I'll Camilla I've got the gorgeous tulips I think the white lilacs are next gorgeous that is okay the next one I have is lisianthus I haven't won wacky pink one okay so the lisianthus i'm gonna put on this side so now I've got a huge bouquet of flowers in the middle and it was so much easier than doing a big bouquet so this looks really good put these away oh I think I heard they're kinda dry but just in time okay who wants a pomegranate cousin palm don't have any fun so get back [Applause] okay who wants a cosmopolitan and the pomegranate juice is so good for you two counteracts the effects of the vodka how's that okay guys I'm gonna go check on the souffle okay 400 degrees 20 minutes we're gonna have hot apple turnovers to dessert but I think this if lays are just about done oh there it goes good the moment of truth oh my god no isn't that a wow they look great no pizza tonight okay guys I think I did it blue cheese soufflés who would leave I knew this crowd would enjoy something more interesting so okay so what do you think well and I'm going to be brutal delicious okay who's ready for dessert is it a desire to play you never know I'll be right back mmm thank you and this one cream if anybody would like some farm I have a suggestion okay what about if we move in with you that way we could do this each and every day and I could cook for you because great now we're trying
[Music] even though my professional life is about cooking the truth is I hate cooking non-stop it's just too exhausting I've invited friends for dinner two nights in a row so I'm making a plan and to make the first dinner in advance I'm making a loin of pork with fennel stuffing it's so delicious and for every one of the things they don't like vegetables a cauliflower gratin that's surprisingly out-of-this-world and crisp green green vegetables sauteed with lots of shallots and for decadent finish pumpkin mousse parfaits creamy layers of pumpkin and whipped cream with spicy ginger cookies in between it's a party that's a holiday celebration but it's great for a celebration any time of the year but I'm entertaining I'm a few really important rings one of them has always served cocktails but the second one is I always try and make things that I can make an advance so I can prepare them refrigerate them and then just throw them in the oven before dinner not easy to find vegetables that you can make in advance but gratins are terrific potato gratin like to make zucchini great an for this dinner when I call a flower Gretchen so I've got a three pound cauliflower I'm just gonna cut it up into florets now okay big pot of boiling salted water that's a slow boil for about five or six minutes until the cauliflower is just tender in the meantime I'm gonna make a delicious white sauce first thing I do is I'm gonna heat up two cups of milk in the meantime grate some cheese I need about 3/4 of a cup of green air about half of the cup is gonna go into the sauce and then I'm gonna put some on top it's all brown and delicious okay so about two tablespoons of butter okay three tablespoons of flour all at once so I'm just cook the flour and the butter together it actually becomes like a paste just gonna pour the milk right in whoa really hot and then just stay this and you see it really thickens up so it's a really good white sauce no it's really nice and smooth now actually you can see it really coats the back of the spoon nicely okay it's thick enough I'm just going to turn it off the heat and add some great flavor first this salt and a teaspoon of kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper and the next thing is really classic French spice so quarter of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then lots of delicious Gruyere cheese about a half a cup and I had parmesan it's not so classic for French Greta knows but it gives it a nice nutty flavor better half a cup of grated Parmesan and then just stir together smells so good you can really smell the nuttiness of the gray air and the spicy parmesan and even nutmeg okay that's done I think cauliflower is ready [Music] and I steam bath this is the Grattan dish I'm gonna use it's about an 8 by 11 but it doesn't have to be exact so the first thing I do is put about a third of the sauce in the bottom it even looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't and then the cauliflower and then the rest of the sauce that actually looks good already but I'm gonna make a nice crumb topping so it gets brown and crusty it'll be so good okay so I need a little bit of butter so it's a quarter cup of breadcrumbs quarter of a cup of Greer just gonna mix this together I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top and then just drizzle it with a little bit of butter never hurt anything I'm just gonna leave that to room temperature and refrigerate it and bake it just before the party [Music] okay so the next vegetable I'm gonna make it's also great to make an advance I call its green green spring vegetables so first I'm going to do is cut off the ends of the asparagus and just cut them on a diagonal the ends are pretty hard so you don't eat those and then put it in the boiling water and blanch them really quickly you want them crisp tender next thing I'm going to do was french stream beans these are called Eriko vert what I do maybe quarter a half a pound of each vegetable it doesn't really matter it's just cut off the ends of the string beans and by now the asparagus should be done this is a great thing it's a Chinese strainer and it's great for lifting vegetables out of hot water I'm just gonna put them in ice water to set the color and stop the cooking you want them a little tender but not completely done okay then the stream beans go in same water and the next thing I have is broccolini I find it really tender and delicious now okay string beans are done happens fast right into the same ice water and then the broccolini and the last vegetable is sugar snap peas the good news is they already come with the end snap so you don't have to do it yourself now get broccoli nice really fast it's done right into the same ice water I'm gonna go the sugar snap peas just about 60 seconds perfect I'm gonna drain these I'm gonna put them in the refrigerator and they'll be ready to saute with showers but enough of the vegetables it's time for pumpkin mousse parfait [Music] this is so wonderful it's a parfait and a tall glass and it's got pumpkin mousse and layers of whipped cream and crumbled cookies it's just delicious the first thing you need though it's quarter of a cup of good dark rum I love this it just smells like the Caribbean to me and we're gonna do is dissolve one packet of gelatin right into the rum just gonna let that soak for a minute and then I'm gonna heat it up and add it back in so first thing I need is one can of pumpkin you can make it from a real pumpkin or you can use this this actually tastes better pumpkin can be really stringy and right out of the can it's just delicious so it's a 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree and I need 1/2 a cup of regular sugar half a cup of light brown sugar just lightly packed is the way its measured okay that's it half a cup of light brown sugar I need two egg yolks and now to get lots of good flavor I'm gonna put in 2 teaspoons of orange zest right in I need half a teaspoon of cinnamon half a teaspoon of salt quarter of a teaspoon of nutmeg I'm just gonna stir it all together mmm this already smells good I love the orange and cinnamon together that looks gorgeous color okay gotta make a mousse out of it I'm gonna take the gelatin I'm gonna heat it up and then add it back in so you'll see that it's a little lumpy when it's softened but when it's dissolved with heat it's really liquidy so that's perfect okay so I'm just gonna pour this right into the pumpkin mixture such a great it may smell the room when it gets hot and what this is gonna do is when it's refrigerated the pumpkin mousse is gonna set just mix it in okay so I need 1/2 cups of heavy cream we want it to be cold before you start because it'll whip so be careful at the end perfect so I'm just gonna take this whipped cream and fold it in for the pumpkin mixture and that's gonna really lighten it and make it sort of like moosie okay now the best way to fold something is to put your spatula through the middle and then fold it over and then turn the bowl and fold it over and that way you don't deflate the cream and you get really light mousse so now what I want to do is I'm gonna layer the pumpkin mousse whipped cream and cookies ginger cookies so the next thing I need to do is make more whipped cream but this time I want to make sweetened whipped cream so I'm gonna have one cup of cream doesn't have to be exact one tablespoon of sugar and one teaspoon of vanilla loves good vanilla I'm just gonna whip that up [Music] so this is what I'm going to put the new thing don't over with it otherwise I mean liquid butter I've actually found if you use a pastry bag it's clear sweeter so I put the muesli bag if you have a pastry bag with a round tip just a plain round tip or even any kind of a big tip I'll show you how quickly it goes just put about a third in the bottom okay so that's the first layer of mousse a little layer of whipped cream now because I love things that have different textures so the most creamy the whipped cream sweet I'm gonna have some crumbled ginger cookies so when you bite into it you get something that's creamy something that's smooth and something that's crunchy it looks great too doesn't that one on the layer of pumpkin [Music] now another layer of whipped cream a little bit top of each one more ginger the last layer of pumpkin well that worked out perfectly [Music] and just so everybody knows we stock it what's in it little ginger cookie decoration on the top and doesn't that look like the party just fridge right that and then I'm gonna make quad of pork with smell stuffing it's gonna be really good [Music] so I want to make a special meal but it doesn't mean it has to be complicated so for the main course I'm gonna make loin of pork and stuff it with fennel show you how to make it so I've cut up about 2 cups of onions just rough chop okay now I need 2 cups of sliced fennel I'm just gonna take out the core I love the anise flavor of this can already smell it it's wonderful and then just slice it thinly so that should be about 2 cups just gonna let this cook for about 15 minutes until the onions and fennel attender and then the fennel gets really sweet wonderful flavor in the meantime let me get some garlic ready and fresh thyme give it lots of flavor some chop the garlic no the thing about garlic is I don't want to put it in too early because it burns really quickly so just let the onions and fennel cook and then put the garlic and at the last minute just a rough chop and then fresh thyme I really prefer to use fresh herbs when you can alright let's see how the onions and fennel just toss them we don't want them to brown too much oh this is beginning to look good I just want to add the garlic add the fresh thyme just chop it up a smidge just release all the oil from the time teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper okay now I'm just gonna add a little bit of wine and what that's gonna do is to glaze the pan it's gonna scrape up all those brown bits that lots of flavor hmm this looks great smells even better okay I'm just gonna turn the heat off and let that sit it'll cool off while I make fresh breadcrumbs so fresh breadcrumbs I'm just going to take white bread cut off the crusts I'm just gonna dice it it's gonna be nice fluffy bread crumbs crumbs [Music] okay now I'm gonna unroll the pork so what I've asked the butcher to do is to butterfly it like a letter so it's in three parts and it's gonna open like that so just see let's see yeah that's perfect okay in a salt and pepper it season it well because you want to make sure it has lots of flavor fresh pepper so now I want to put the bread crumbs into the stuffing so about three cups of fresh breadcrumbs into the cooled fennel and onions and that's gonna really bind it and hold it together so when the loin of pork is sliced the stuff and won't fall out them okay so it's nice and cool now I'm just gonna put it right on top of a loin of pork if I'm gonna bake this right away it doesn't matter whether the filling is cooled but since I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator and bake it another day I want to be sure kind of like the Thanksgiving turkey but the stuffing is really cool and I'm gonna roll it up like a jelly roll just like that and you want to end fat side up like that doesn't have to be perfect okay now just gonna tie it up with butchers string you can find this in any cookware store there are all kinds of fancy ways to tie this but just not at the top is totally fine because I'm gonna take it off before I serve it anyway and what this is gonna do is keep the wanted work in a really nice shape they'll keep it nice and round and keep the stuffing in and that way also it cooks evenly and okay now I'm just gonna rub the top of this with a little olive oil oops I put a lot of olive oil salt pepper okay into the fridge and it's gonna be all ready to go into the oven for my dinner party [Music] what a day lots of shopping the good news is dinner's ready it's in the fridge I'm going to put it in the oven saute three vegetables and dinner's done okay that's gonna roast 425 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes and then we're gonna lower the temperature to 350 and it's gonna go for about twenty to thirty minutes until it's exactly one hundred thirty seven degrees [Music] the cauliflower got tan I'm gonna bake at 375 for about 25 to 30 minutes and you know great ends aren't that sensitive if you leave one of them put it in with the loin of pork so I'm just gonna chop up three shallots how you doing over there the string is done but I need to just show me how you had a car do that yeah so I'll show you I'll do one or two how's that that's perfect so the knife should be pretty sure what you want to do is use the blade back and forth see the family do it too soon because I want the filling to fall out easy okay back to the vegetables inside the oil and the butter all melted I'm gonna put in three shower sort of chopped up it's a great way to make vegetables when you have company because all I'm doing it's gonna reheat them with a shower [Music] [Applause] okay I'm done are you doing over there I am done that's it a dish of the time it doesn't it can really smell the fennel can check looks great a little parsley always helps right okay are you in charge of this I am thank you and can you take this - absolutely I'll be very much calls like four at ten it smells so good it's a party [Music] [Laughter] you know there are people do you think [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Good morning. Thank you guys, all, for coming. We are very excited today to be welcoming the Barefoot Contessa, Ina Garten, here to San Francisco. [applause] &gt;&gt;Ina: Not nearly as excited as I am to be here. &gt;&gt;Marissa: And Ina's here for the Fancy Food Show, but we were lucky to snag her for a visit here today. And so, by the way, we also have-- she has a new cookbook out called "How Easy Is That?" And so, there's a hundred of those available if you wanna snag one. Ina will sign cookbooks afterwards and you can come up and meet her and ask her your questions. We also have the questions on the Dory Page, but we're really, really excited to have you. So, I'm gonna go ahead and go through a little bit of your background which I think everyone here is probably already familiar with, but I think there's some really great parts to it. So, Ina and I met last April at a women's event and we got to hear a little bit about our stories, each other's stories and it was just really fun. And we've met again since, through our friend, Juliet du Baubigny at Kleiner Perkins, one of our original VC firms because Juliet turns out to be Ina's neighbor-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Next door neighbor of all things. &gt;&gt;Marissa: in the Hamptons. [Marissa laughs] And so, I went to see Juliet this summer and we were going to dinner at her neighbors' and it turned out to be Ina, so we met again there. And so, I actually have had dinner and brunch in Ina's famous kitchen. [Marissa laughs] &gt;&gt;Ina: It was one of my-- &gt;&gt;Marissa: And it was really, really amazing. &gt;&gt;Ina: great pleasures. It was one of my great pleasures to say to Juliet, "Oh, I know Marissa." [Ina and Marissa laugh] &gt;&gt;Marissa: I had one of the best coffee cake I've ever had with sugar rolled into the crust; it was amazing. [Ina and Marissa laugh] But Ina's story is really fascinating because she started off working in the White House. &gt;&gt;Ina: I did. Nuclear energy policy. How light is that? &gt;&gt;Marissa: I was gonna say, it's amazing. Budget analyst, writing the nuclear energy budget and policy papers on nuclear centrifuge for Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. [Ina and Marissa laugh] &gt;&gt;Ina: You know, science, cooking; it actually is related. [laughter] Except, instead of hydrochloric acid, you end up with coffee cake. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: I think we can all appreciate that. All of us here like to apply science in unusual ways. &gt;&gt;Ina: It's more fun. &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, and then as she was working there, saw an ad for a specialty food store that was for sale in the Hamptons called "The Barefoot Contessa," and she bought the store and scaled it. And so, much like we've scaled Google, Ina scaled it from a 400 square foot shop to now over three thousand square foot shop. It moved twice and was this very, very successful business. She sold it to two of the employees in 1996, and then wrote a cookbook. And I actually want Ina to tell the story, but I think it was really interesting about how you made the bridge from the store to the cookbook. &gt;&gt;Ina: Actually, Marissa and I were talking about this, I always wanted to-- I'd been doing the store for about 20 years and I thought, "You know, it's really time to do something else." And for a couple of years, I was saying, "Well, what is that? What is that? I've gotta know what it is." And a friend of mine said to me, "Type A people think they can figure out what they're gonna do next while they're doing something, and they can't." [chuckles] She said, "You have to quit. You just have to do nothing for a year." And so, that's when I thought, "OK, I'll sell the store to two employees, the chef and the manager, and then I'll just have nothing to do." [laughter] If you think that's easy, it's not. I built myself an office upstairs in the building that we had, where the store was and I sat there for a year with nothing to do. My husband, Jeffrey, is at Yale, and he would leave on Monday and come back on Friday. And when he left on Monday one week, I said, "I have nothing to do." [laughter] I said, "Wait a minute." I looked at my schedule. I said, "I have a manicure on Wednesday and that's it." [laughter] But it really was out of sheer, total boredom. One day I'd been baking a thousand baguettes and running a store with a hundred employees, and the next day had nothing to do. After about, I think, nine months, out of sheer boredom I thought, "Well, I have to do something." And Jeffrey said, "Stay in the game. You love the food business. Just do something in the food business." And I thought, "Well, I never wanted to write a cookbook" cause I thought it would be boring, but, "OK, maybe I'll write a cookbook just so I have something to do tomorrow." And it never would have happened if I hadn't started and then it turned out cookbook writing is really interesting. &gt;&gt;Marissa: And of course… &gt;&gt;Ina: So, it was very good advice. &gt;&gt;Marissa: … the cookbooks led to the television show-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Television show, yes-- &gt;&gt;Marissa: which I heard that you actually turned down the proposal the first time around. &gt;&gt;Ina: Over and over and over again. [laughter] Food Network was at a moment--and Marissa knows this-- Food Network was at a moment when they had the French chefs with the big toques and everybody, and there was nothing; triple-layer mousses and there was one woman at Food Network who said, "I think it should be of people that do home-cooking, people who really understand how people cook at home." And she went out and found four people. She found Rachel Ray, Paula Dean, Giada and me, and to this day, that really is the basis of Food Network. And I just said, "No, no, no, no, no, I could never do that. Cooking on television? Forget it." So, she went away and came back about six months later with a better offer. [laughter] And I thought, and I said, "No, no, no. I'm not negotiating. I really don't want to do this." She came back six months later with a better offer-- [laughter] and I was like, "No. Go away." [laughter] And in the meantime, a friend of mine who had gone to Australia and seen a TV show, a cooking show, that he thought was interesting and so I went to Food Network and said, "Could you get me a copy of this show so I could see it?" And it was fantastic. And I said, "But I still don't wanna do a TV show." [laughter] And so, the Food Network went to London, found the producer, hired them and called me and said, "They're coming to East Hampton. Now will you do it?" And I was like, "Whoa." So, I agreed to do 13 shows, thinking that would solve that and here we are nine years later. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: And an Emmy. I mean, I will say that actually, the Emmy is as sharp, heavy, and pointy as you'd expect. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Ina: It is. &gt;&gt;Marissa: One of the dinner guests managed to see it tucked deep in the corners amidst some papers in Ina's office. &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, really? &gt;&gt;Marissa: We all went in and held it, so-- &gt;&gt;Ina: It has a twin. It has a twin sister now. [laughter] A second one. &gt;&gt;Marissa: A pair of them. And I will say, I mean, Ina obviously is just phenomenally popular, admired all over. The first day that I met her, as I said, we were at this women's event and it happened, and just by happenstance, Oprah Winfrey happened to be there. And when I first met Ina, Oprah Winfrey, there was a fan of Ina's that was so excited to see Ina; she shoved Oprah out of the way. [laughter] She was like, "Oh my God! Ina Garten!" And I was like, "That was Oprah." [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: And there I was standing on the podium and Oprah's next to me and she didn't speak to me the whole time. I thought, until a few nights ago, I never understood why. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, that's a little bit of background. So, we have some questions. I have some questions, here. We have questions from our group and we also can take questions from the mic. So, if you wanna ask Ina a question, you can come here. We have mics in the center and on the side here if you wanna ask a question. &gt;&gt;Ina: I'll bet there's an algorithm for hearing the most popular question. Where else? [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: And actually, the question I was gonna start with is at the top of the Dory, so I will just go to that, which is, "Well, my question was do you have a favorite dish that you just love to make?" And I know it's hard; it's almost like asking someone to pick a favorite child. &gt;&gt;Ina: Child. No, no no. It's actually, I have a few. I have a few, but my go-to meal when somebody's coming, they've never been there before and I've got a million things going on, is a meal that's in my Parties book, which is rack of lamb and orzo with roasted vegetables and it's so easy and it's absolutely delicious and nobody can believe that you, I mean, everybody thinks you worked all day on it. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, I guess that's the go-to. What do you think makes a good chef? It's hard, but what are the qualities? &gt;&gt;Ina: That's a really interesting question. I just think if people that really, I think what-- I'm not a restaurant chef, I'm not brilliant cook. I just think I really care about flavor and the texture of how things taste. And so, I think if somebody's really interested in that, you're willing to just keep going until it's exactly the way you want it to be, rather than settling. And somebody once said to me, and it's really amazingly true, "There are two ingredients that everybody has in their house that is very often the difference between something that's fairly ordinary and something that's absolutely delicious, and it's salt and pepper." [audience chuckles] It's -- most things aren't seasoned properly and I think that really makes a huge difference and I'm not happy unless it tastes fantastic. So, I think that's really what makes a good chef -- is a real passion for a really satisfying, delicious, and it can be also a very simple meal. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Sure. So, is that what you would say the biggest mistake most chefs make is not seasoning properly? &gt;&gt;Ina: Biggest mistake: salt. It's amazing what a difference it makes. The other day, I was testing a recipe for braised lamb shanks for my next book and I said to my assistant, "Taste it and see what you think." And I hadn't tasted it – the finished -- ; it had just come out of the oven and she said, "Mmm, it's OK. It's not great." And I tasted it and I said, "OK, I'll be right back." Salt, pepper and a splash of white wine and I said, "Taste it now." And she was like, "Oh my God! This is the best thing I ever ate." [laughter] And it was the same dish. It was so amazing what that, so I think that's the biggest mistake. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Very cool. So, let me have a couple of, I think I have a quick question just to pick your brain. [Ina laughs] So-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Let's see, the smartest people on the planet. [Ina laughs] [audience laughs] Just go ask anything. &gt;&gt;Marissa: One was three cooking utensils that are the most important to you. [pause] &gt;&gt;Ina: Good, sharp knives. Critical. Doesn't have to be a hundred knives; it has to be three really, good knives. I love a zester, like those rasps because I usually think that the zest on a lemon or an orange or something has more flavor than the juice itself. And half-sheet pans; I have a stack of them. Everything goes in a half-sheet: brownies, roasted carrots, rack of lamb, everything. I mean, obviously you need more equipment than that, like an oven. [laughter] But, I mean, those are things I literally couldn't live without. &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, another question from the Dory. Say it's your last day. It's kind of morbid, but-- [Ina laughs] What would your meal be? &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, that's interesting because I actually was asked this question. Somebody auctioned off a cocktail party or something for benefit, and these young women came; they were just adorable. And they said-- one of them was British-- and she said, "What's your hangman’s meal?" And I was like, "What's that?" [laughter] It turns out it's the same thing; it's your last dinner. And I said, "I don't know what it would be, but I know it would have really good Chateau de Camp Sauternes with every single course." [laughter] So, the first one might be foie gras. I know it's completely not PC, but it would be foie gras. The second one would probably be a lobster, like a grilled lobster thing, which is great with Chateau de Camp. And the third one would be a very thin French apple tart with Chateau de Camp. So, I think-- [laughter] the prison would be really out of a lot of money if I ordered that as my last meal. &gt;&gt;Marissa: We'll go ahead and take a question from the audience. &gt;&gt;audience #1: Hi. Hello. I'd like to ask about copyright intellectual property issues in writing a cookbook. I've got a wonderful pile of recipes from aunts and Mom and acquaintances and can you use those in a cookbook? &gt;&gt;Ina: As long as they're not copyrighted, yes, absolutely. Sure. &gt;&gt;audience #1: Thanks. &gt;&gt;Ina: That shouldn't be any problem. I would probably ask their permission just to be nice. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #1: Some of them are so old. They're 30 years old and I have no idea where they came from. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, yeah. Absolutely you could-- &gt;&gt;audience #1: Thanks. &gt;&gt;Ina: and that would be wonderful to publish all those old recipes. &gt;&gt;audience #1: Thank you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: And we have a lot of people who are interested in the actual filming of the television show. So, is it actually filmed in your kitchen? &gt;&gt;Ina: It is filmed in my house. It actually is and we've been doing it there, originally in my house and then I built this huge barn, which Marissa knows, next door. So, my commute to work is about 50 yards. [Ina laughs] And yeah, we do film that. I just think it always feels like a set and I love when we do the parties. It's a real party. They're my friends and I tell the director, "Just leave us alone." We just have to have a good time; you can't fake it. If you're not having a good time, it doesn't look like a good time. So, it's really wonderful. I love the people. It's the same producer that originally started and yeah, it's great. And I get to cook in my own kitchen. [Ina and Marissa laugh] &gt;&gt;Marissa: And then a compliment in the form of a question of, "Does Jeffrey know he's the luckiest man in the world?" [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: The dirty little secret is I'm high maintenance. [laughter] He was stopped at a restaurant recently and someone said, "Do you know that you're the best fed man in America?" He didn't take that quite as a compliment. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: And everyone here knows, but we had Ina do our Thanksgiving Doodle and so-- &gt;&gt;Ina: That was so much fun. &gt;&gt;Marissa: The original idea was well; we knew we wanted to maybe have a chef cook the Doodle. And then we thought, "OK. What chef is really popular who would be cooking a Thanksgiving dinner?" And so, we asked Ina to do it. She obliged and so then we were so inspired by it that we realized we didn't just want to run it on Thanksgiving Day; we wanted to do it in the lead-up to Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt;Ina: So people could shop for the ingredients. &gt;&gt;Marissa: So people could shop for the ingredients and do the recipes. And so, our Doodler staff was also in the kitchen and has also done a photo shoot with Ina. And so, one of the questions is, "What was it like being involved in the Google Doodle?" &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I mean, it started out with an email from Marissa and she knows I was walking around all day going, "Oh my God!" [laughter] It was wonderful. It was absolutely wonderful. It was in the middle of my book tour and the only day that we could find to do it was a Sunday. So, I mean, they flew in and it was Preston and Mike Dutton. Preston Hershorn and Mike Dutton if they're here. And, oh, there they are. [laughter] And it was so much fun and you just think, "Oh, we'll just whip something up." And as we all know from the photo shoot, it's never "you just whip something up." We had two turkeys ready; we had two of everything. And it was a real exciting day. It was wonderful. &gt;&gt;Marissa: It was a beautiful day. &gt;&gt;Ina: And it was fun to see the photographs that we were taking. The photographer had the digital image, and then to see Mike and Preston move it into the actual Doodle. So, it was thrilling. It doesn't get any better than that. &gt;&gt;Marissa: We had a great response to that. &gt;&gt;Ina: Did you have a great response? &gt;&gt;Marissa: We had a great response to that. &gt;&gt;Ina: OK, good. &gt;&gt;Marissa: I mean, probably you saw some of that, too, but we were out on NPR, like hundreds of mentions all over the Web-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh how fabulous. &gt;&gt;Marissa: and let alone the tweets, right? The tweets just were I think, probably numbered in the hundreds of thousands. &gt;&gt;Ina: I saw there was a panic somewhere. [laughter] That was good. That was a good description. &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, one of the questions is, "Since you're here in the Bay area, are there any restaurants that you love going out to here?" &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I love being here because the food is amazing. I mean, just from the farmer's market at the Ferry Building, but I have to say secretly, the best meal I've ever had was at Marissa's house and it was the chef at Quince, which is just fantastic. [laughter] It was really stunning; both the food and the wine, it was just incredible. Thank you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: This is Michael Tusk, one of the local chefs. He did a really good job. His pasta is just to die for. That's what he's most known for. &gt;&gt;Ina: It was just fantastic. And last night, we went to Tyler Florence's restaurant, Wayfare Tavern, which was great. Which was great. Everybody, I love, there's something just so democratic about food here. It's just available to everybody and I've always loved Zuni Cafe. And the first time I went there, we took a taxi from the hotel to the cafe and the taxi driver said, "Oh, you've just gotta get the roast chicken and the Caesar salad." And I thought, "How great is that?" [laughter] And here, everybody always telling we're going to Wayfare Tavern and they were like, "Oh, you have to get the fried chicken and you have to put the lemon on it. It's really important." I was like, "That's good." [laughter] So, I just love that it's available to everybody who really cares about good food and it shows. &gt;&gt;Marissa: We've got a live question. &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh. Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #2: Hi Ina, and thanks so much for coming. This is really fun. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you for inviting me. &gt;&gt;audience #2: So, I think it's safe to say that you've been a really big inspiration to a lot of people who either haven't cooked before or who just want to enhance their skills and whatnot and become better chefs. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #2: But what I'm curious to find out is what inspires you and if you could walk us through the process of what it's like to come up with a new recipe and put something together? &gt;&gt;Ina: You know, a friend of mine always said, and I think it's really true, "You can't have ideas sitting home by yourself." You have to get out there, especially in this design world and the world of food; you have to see what's going on. One thing that I learned about having a specialty food store is the food that you eat at home is very different from the food you eat in a restaurant. And so, it's home cooking that I'm really interested in. When I first started, I would do like, veal with morels in the store and nobody would buy it. [laughter] And then I remember putting out a huge platter of chicken that had fresh herbs on the platter. It looked just gorgeous. Nobody bought one of them. So, I took the platter, I went back into the kitchen and I came out with chicken in those little, red paper cups that you get French fries in and lined them up on the counter and they just flew out of the store. So, I thought, "OK, it's about home cooking." And so, what I like to do is go to specialty food stores, but even sometimes I go to Milan and see the colors of the new fashions. And one year, I remember when I was doing my first book, they were doing cantalope and azure blue and raspberry together and I thought, "Oh, that's good for the colors of the book." And that's what I did. So, I think about something that I would wanna eat and I say this-- I'm like an idiot savant about what people want to eat-- nobody wants to eat fish eyeballs in foam. [laughter] You wanna eat roast chicken and rack of lamb. And so, I start with an idea of what I want it to taste like and what I want the texture to be, and if I don't I never get where I'm going. But if I do, it's that little ping in my head that says, "OK, that's exactly what I was looking for." And it could take two tries or it could take 25 tries, but I don't stop until I get there. &gt;&gt;audience #2: And then you've [ ] a lot of books, TV show, what's next for you? &gt;&gt;Ina: I always say this; if it just stays just the way it is right now, I'll be very happy. And then something comes along the screen and I go, "Oh, that might be fun." [laughter] But it's gotta be fun. &gt;&gt;audience #2: Thanks. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #3: Thank you very much for coming. My question is actually very similar to hers. I think that you've all given us a very inspirational story for how you've gotten to where you are now, but I think a lot of us are curious to know what's on the horizon? If there are any things, a direction for your next cookbook, or if there's something aside from writing cookbooks or appearing on TV that you'd like to do with the inspirational journey that you've already gone on? &gt;&gt;Ina: I just always, I keep doing, I get up in the morning, I think, "What would be interesting to do today?" And it's just, for me, just putting one foot in front of another and doing what I think is really interesting and challenging myself. And I always feel like the rest of it follows. &gt;&gt;audience #4: I have two teenage daughters who are 15 and 17 and I'm realizing they're gonna go off to college soon and I haven't done a very good job of teaching them how to cook. [Ina laughs] We normally go to Panda Express, but-- [Ina laughs] I'm working on that. I'm working on that. I was just wondering if you have any tips on teaching our children, our teenagers how to cook so that they like it, so that they don't associate it with a chore-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Work. &gt;&gt;audience #4: and any particular tips or recipes that you have for teenagers. &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I think now it's not the situation where mom's at home all the time and teaching everybody how to cook and enjoying it and transferring that pleasure. I actually think Food Network has been amazing because kids all watch Food Network. And particularly, I like that boys, eight year old boys are cooking because of Bobby Flay and Emeril and all the guys who are. It's fun. They just see that its fun, that it's really exciting and I think the biggest lesson, is that if you cook, everybody shows up. And it's that simple. It really is, so if you enjoy everybody showing up, they'll learn to cook. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #5: Hey. &gt;&gt;Ina: Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #5: Thanks for coming. &gt;&gt;Ina: Sure. &gt;&gt;audience #5: I have a two part question. So, I just read Anthony Bourdain's book, "Medium Raw", and have related to your fish eyes and-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah. Blerg. &gt;&gt;audience #5: First, what's your take on Anthony Bourdain and what's he like in person if you ever met him? [laughter] Just cause I love him, and second-- &gt;&gt;Ina: I love Anthony Bourdain. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #5: Do you think home cooking can be as high culinary as these crazy creations such as making foams and eating eyeballs and other kind of small plate type things where you pay a lot of money? &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, a lot of this really molecular gastronomy requires equipment and I would never have that equipment cause nobody has it. I think home cooking is much more satisfying, more traditional. I think people go out sometimes for a satisfying meal, but also to be challenged. So, I think that-- I went to a restaurant with a friend of mine and she ordered oyster ice cream and I was just like, "Oh God, nobody ever needs to eat oyster ice cream." [laughter] So, this doesn't inspire me to wanna make it at home, but I think you certainly can. But you always have the feeling, I remember when I was first married, I read an article for young brides, which was eons ago, that said if you spend the entire day making dinner for your husband, he can't possibly appreciate it enough. And it’s not his fault, it's your fault. So, if you spend the entire day making dinner for your friends or your family or whatever, they can't possibly appreciate it enough. They're gonna eat it in half an hour no matter what it is. So, I think the simpler it is, the more satisfying it is to them, but also to you. So, I think, and actually I think Anthony Bourdain's fantastic. I love what he does. I actually haven't met him, but I love his work and he's fantastic. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: I think it's interesting because one of the things we do here at Google is we have this thing we call "Dog Food." &gt;&gt;Ina: Dog Food? [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: Meaning to eat your own dog food. So, one of the things we do is similar to you having just one oven and trying to put yourself in the space of the users is-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Yes, yes. &gt;&gt;Marissa: we make a point of using all the Google products. &gt;&gt;Ina: That's really nice. Exactly the same thing-- &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, like everything, Google Docs runs on, we do all of our doc work on Google Docs-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah. &gt;&gt;Marissa: and Calendar and Android phones and so-- &gt;&gt;Ina: That's funny; eat your own dog food. &gt;&gt;Marissa: everyone uses the products so they can really be in the place of the user, and in your case, of the viewer, the person trying to cook. &gt;&gt;Ina: I think that's a really important point. And actually, once I figured out a recipe, that's just the beginning of how I test the recipe. I then hand the recipe, once I figured exactly what I want to do, I hand it to my assistant and I say to her-- she's never with nothing else other than a printed page-- I say, "Make this." And I sit there and watch her. And she does the craziest things-- [laughter] that would never occur to me to do. And so then I write the recipe around that because that's what somebody at home is gonna do. And I've been in the food business too long; it would never occur to me to stir the caramel with a spoon. So, you have to swirl it in the pan. And then the next thing I do is what I call "road testing" it, which is, I put it together with a meal and I feed it to my friends and sometimes they're invited for six desserts because I wanna see which one they wanna eat. And that's my road testing the recipes. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Road testing the coffee cake was unbelievable. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: I'm hoping the recipe is in the book. &gt;&gt;Ina: It is. [Ina and Marissa laugh] It's on my email; I'll send it to you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Let's go ahead for another question there. &gt;&gt;audience #6: Would you mind sharing a story of making a dish that went horribly wrong? [Ina and audience #6 laugh] &gt;&gt;Ina: Horribly wrong. I tend not to make something that I haven't made before, literally even for dinner for Jeffrey. I do remember when we first got married, I made some recipe that had ground beef and corn in it that was just dreadful. [laughter] Something that's just gone horribly wrong. I remember a dessert just didn't happen right. I mean, I don't know what happened and it was the genesis. I thought, "Oh my God. People are coming in like, an hour, and I don't have dessert." And I decided, well, I had some creme fraiche and honey and vanilla and I made honey vanilla creme fraiche for the berries that I had in the refrigerator. And it was the genesis of one of the best recipes I've written. It was really simple and it was, it's out of the disastrous that something good comes out of it. [laughter] Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #7: Hi. I have just a quick question related to the last question. How do you handle it when a recipe fails and you have company? Do you apologize? Do you ignore it? What's the best steps of handling and communicating the disaster? &gt;&gt;Ina: I say nobody ever needs to know. [laughter] It's that simple. I remember being at a friend’s house for a dinner party and we're all, it was like, 20 people for dinner and we were all having cocktails and everybody’s having a good time and it got later and later and later. And everybody said, "You go into the kitchen and find out what's going on." So, I went in and it turns out she had set out all the first courses on the table and her two dogs had jumped on the table and gone all the way down the table and eaten everybody's first course. [laughter] And she was trying to make a first course. And I said to her, "You know what? Just forget the first course. Let's just have dinner, we'll sit down and nobody will ever know." So, nobody ever needs to see you sweat. &gt;&gt;audience #7: Great. &gt;&gt;Ina: And if all else fails, there's always take-out pizza. And you can, a friend of mine actually has what she calls her "disaster Christmas party." Every year something horrible happens and they just laugh about it and those are the ones -- the caterer got stuck in traffic and then the sofa caught on fire one time. [laughter] It's always something, and those are the best parties. [laughter] So, you just have a good laugh about it and nobody ever needs to know. &gt;&gt;audience #7: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #8: Hi. As a beginning home cook, out of college where all you cook with is a microwave and whatever you steal from a cafe. [Ina laughs] What are the three basic things that you need for a home cook -- because I think watching TV shows, it can be very overwhelming. They have a Kitchen Aid, a food processor and everything. &gt;&gt;Ina: I'm thinking if there's anything that you can't cook if you have knives and half-sheet pans. You can make roast chicken, you can make roast carrots, and maybe one sauce pan that you can make some pasta in. You really, this is a book I'd really love to write is the only ten recipes you need to know, because if you can make a roast chicken, you can make roast Cornish hens; you can make a roast turkey. It's the same process; it's just slightly different times. If you can make a chicken pot pie, you can make a lobster pot pie; you can make a vegetable pot pie. So, choose one thing, like a roast chicken, which is actually really simple to do; test it when you don't have any guests, so you learn how to do it and just keep making it over and over again. Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #9: Thanks for coming here today and-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Nice to see you again. &gt;&gt;audience #9: my wife is definitely one of your biggest fans. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #9: So, we talked a little bit about how you got into television, but you also made the jump from the White House to the Barefoot Contessa. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what inspired you to do that and what advice you would give to other people who are looking to make that sort of a career jump. &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, you know, when I was in my 20s, my husband was in the White House in the State Department; he worked for Kissinger. And I just thought I was the leading generation of women that were starting to work; it never occurred to me to have a career. And so, in my 20s, I wanted to grow up to be Jeffrey. And when I hit 30, I thought, "He's great, but I don't wanna be him." [laughter] He's like the intellectual in the family. I just wanna have fun. So, what I used to do when I wasn't working was have dinner parties -- every Saturday, I'd have a dinner party and I'd work my way through Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking", Volume I and Volume II, and I thought, "Well, maybe I should be doing that instead." And I was sitting in my office in the White House, trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up and there was an ad for a specialty foods store for sale. And I went home and I said to Jeffrey, "I gotta do something else." And he said, "Well, pick something you think would be really fun. Pick something. Don't worry about making money. Think about what you love to do because if you love it, you'll be really good at it." And I said, "Funny you should mention it." [laughter] I saw this ad and bless his heart, he said, "Let's go look at it tomorrow." So, I really had no idea what I was getting into, but I knew I was going. The White House wasn't an option anymore. Nuclear energy policy wasn't my passion. And I loved, if it's anybody's, I don't know. [laughter] It must be somebody's. &gt;&gt;audience #9: Actually, I do energy policy here at Google and I used to work in the White House doing energy policy. &gt;&gt;Ina: I'm sorry? &gt;&gt;audience #9: I used to work in the White House doing energy policy-- &gt;&gt;Ina: You're kidding. &gt;&gt;audience #9: and I actually do energy work here at Google. &gt;&gt;Ina: Isn't it great? &gt;&gt;audience 9: But it's my passion. &gt;&gt;Ina: Congratulations. [uproarious laughter] What administration did you work in? &gt;&gt;audience #9: Clinton. &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh my goodness. That's fabulous. So you know exactly how I feel. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;audience #9: But I'm not looking to make a career change, just so you know. [laughter] Thank you. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. Congratulations, that's a great career move. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, we have time for just a few more questions. Let's, we got, I think, three here. So, yeah. &gt;&gt;audience #10: Hi, Ina. &gt;&gt;Ina: Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #10: Great to see you here at Google. I am not much of a cook, but my wife is a huge fan. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #10: With the tablet computer set to invade kitchens, could you give us an-- &gt;&gt;Ina: I'm so sorry. Can you speak a little louder? I can't quite hear. &gt;&gt;audience #10: With the tablet computers-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Yes. &gt;&gt;audience #10: set to invade kitchens-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt;audience #10: Hopefully, lots of Google-based tablets. &gt;&gt;Ina: Yes. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: Android tablets to invade kitchens. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #10: Could you give us an artist’s perspective on how you see technology helping us become better cooks? &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I think one of the things about tablets that can actually work is, for example, I have my latest book on an e-book through Amazon and I know it’s a thing that you're carrying with you, so I thought, "Well, how can we make this more appropriate for shopping, say?" So, all the recipes are in the— it's the whole book-- but also every ingredient, you can click on the ingredient and it tells you what a Bosque pear looks like and it tells you how to know whether a Bosque pear is ripe when it's brown or green. Or should it be soft or should it be hard when it's ripe? Or, you go to the olive oil section and it says there are a million olive oils. You just can't imagine what to choose. They are the two that I recommend; one's more inexpensive, one's more expensive. So, it can have a lot of information for you and I think it will go towards when you get to, you can tap on the-- when you're cooking--you can tap on the word "whip" and you'll see what it means if you're really a beginning cook, if you need all that help. If you're not a beginning cook, you just cruise right past it. So, I think it can have a lot of depth that just a plain printed recipe can't do. So, hopefully that's where we're going. &gt;&gt;audience #11: I just wanna say, I absolutely adore you and my kids and I have a ritual every night that we have you on in the background while we're making dinner together. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. I love that you're making dinner with your kids. That's great. &gt;&gt;audience #11: So, they're gonna be thrilled that I [ ]. But I just think you're so warm and loving and you're, it just really comes across. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #11: But my question for you is when I read that Barefoot Contessa was sold, I was really wondering why you didn't buy it back at that point and why you let it go? And where is it now? And I've always been curious about that. &gt;&gt;Ina: About the store? &gt;&gt;audience #11: Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, actually, when I made the decision that it was time to sell the store to the employees, and that I was gonna take it off, it never occurred to me. I thought that era of Barefoot Contessa was over and I was gonna do something else. And then when I started writing books, I said to them, "Well, do you want me to write Barefoot Contessa books? Cause they own the store. Or, should I do Ina Garten books?" And they said, "No, no, no. Please, please, do Barefoot Contessa books." So, as time went on and they decided they wanted to go on, one wanted to have a restaurant and the other one had children or didn't want to work anymore, I actually bought the business back. &gt;&gt;audience #11: Oh, OK. &gt;&gt;Ina: So, I do own Barefoot Contessa. Yeah, so it worked. &gt;&gt;audience #11: Oh, good. Now, where does Jeffrey go? I always wonder, where's he going? &gt;&gt;Ina: Yale. &gt;&gt;audience #11: OK. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: He was the Dean of the, well, he was a lot of things. He was an investment banker; he was in the Clinton Administration-- &gt;&gt;audience #11: OK. &gt;&gt;Ina: and he was the Dean of the business school at Yale. I know he looks like a crazy person. [laughter] Like all he does is just sit there or go shopping for oranges for me on the show. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #11: Right. &gt;&gt;Ina: But he's really a smart guy. &gt;&gt;audience #11: Well, he always comes back for his roasted chicken on Friday night. &gt;&gt;Ina: Right, that's right. On Monday, he goes to New Haven where he now teaches at Yale, among other things, and then comes back on Friday. That's the roast chicken night. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #11: [ ] where does he come from? OK. Thank you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Ina and Jeffrey are the power couple. In fact, I have lots of emails from Googlers who had gotten their Yale MBAs, including Lazlo Bock, who's-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, really? Oh. &gt;&gt;Marissa: our head of HR here. &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, fabulous. &gt;&gt;Marissa: And so he wanted to come and say hello because he was like, "Oh, I know Ina and Jeffrey." [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah, Jeffrey has his own rep. I was having dinner one night at a restaurant in East Hampton with Susan Stroman, who is the producer, no, the director and choreographer of "The Producers", among other things, and Mel Brooks and Nathan Lane and Jeffrey and me. And somebody from across the restaurant was coming towards us and Susan Stroman, who we call "Stro" said, "Oh my God. I don't know who she's gonna, who this persons gonna come after. Is it Mel? Oh, he's gonna be thrilled. Is it Nathan? He's gonna be really upset." And the person came right over and said, "Oh my God. Jeffrey Garten." [laughter] So, he has his own base of fans. [laughter] It was like, "Get out of the way, Mel Brooks." [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: OK, so we'll take one more question and then we'll have casual questions after. Yeah? &gt;&gt;audience #12: Hi, Ina. &gt;&gt;Ina: Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #12: I was just wondering if you would ever consider being on Iron Chef, and if you were, who would you battle and what would you want the secret ingredient to be? [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I'd definitely pick a non-cook. You know, the truth is, I'm not a restaurant chef. I can make something perfectly delicious if I have enough time to do it, but I admire those guys enormously. You really have to be a line cook and a chef to be able to do those. I mean, if somebody gave me oysters and heavy cream and said, "Make something out of this." I'd have a total meltdown. [laughter] So, I actually cook the way you do. I'm really a home cook. I know how to do it, I've had a little more experience, so it's a little easier, but I'm really not in that category at all. I don't consider, I consider myself a business person who cooks, rather than a chef. &gt;&gt;audience #12: Who would you wanna cook aside, though, if you could have a partner. Who would you choose to be your partner? &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I love Bobby Flay. I love the way he, I love his energy and I love what he does. So, I'd choose him and then I'd just watch him. [laughter] I'd be around going, "What should I do now?" &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, this has been really, really delightful. I know we have lots of people who want autographs and photos and want a chance to chat with you. &gt;&gt;Ina: I'd love to. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Ina's gonna be here for probably about the next half an hour and then she's gonna get to experience a Google lunch. &gt;&gt;Ina: Yay!! &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, you can see how our chefs cook. And this was really wonderful. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you so much for inviting me. Thank you, Marissa. Thank you. [applause]
[Music] why don't we leave turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas the order an eight pound bird it's really not any more difficult than roasting a chicken I've invited my entire office for dinner tonight three incredible women I'm sure they're expecting takeout pizza so first I'm gonna roast a turkey for the lemon and herb butter to go with it I'll make a vegetable tea on Ed with zucchini tomatoes and potatoes and some light as a art I'm popovers who would love that and to finish it off a creme brulee with a really creamy custard and a crispy caramel topping [Music] we always think of Turkey as this monster 25 pound bird that we have for Thanksgiving when I'm having a few friends over I'd love to get maybe an 8 to 10 pound turkey it's really just like roasting a big chicken and then you can have it all year round so I've got fresh thyme from my garden it's just wonderful and I'm gonna make an herb butter with it and it's gonna keep the turkey really moist and flavorful so 1/4 cup butter so here's what you do with time you take a stem hold the end of it and then run your fingers backwards along the stem and the leaves will just come right off I'm just gonna roughly chop it doesn't have to be perfect just a rough chop and that should be about a tablespoon of fresh thyme whoo smells so good we thought maybe a little lemon so I've got butter thyme lemon a little bit of salt to give it more flavor because we use unsalted butter and I'm just gonna mash it all together okay that's all done so I've got my fresh turkey try and get a fresh turkey if you can rather than a frozen one I think they're really much better this one's organic which is even better I'm just gonna run my fingers right underneath the skin it's a messy job but it's really worth doing just be sure you don't break the skin okay great one side and then the other side okay ready for the butter so I'll show you I'm gonna do I'm gonna take the butter and just take a glob of it and put it right under the skin and then because it's room temperature you can sort of smush it around it's a cold wet job now okay one more big blob on the other side and just push it around underneath the skin you can actually see the lemon and you can see the time underneath the skin and then I'm just going to take the rest of it and just base the outside so when the turkey cooks the skins gonna get nice and brown and the herb butter flavors the skin it flavors the turkey it's gonna be so good okay I'm just gonna wash up before I finish it [Music] so now I'm gonna give the turkey even more flavor when they do is take the rest of this lemon cut it in quarters and just put it right in the middle of the turkey that's gonna make them meat even more flavorful let's see I think I'll do an onion just cut the ends off cut it in quarters and just put it in the middle anything to give it more flavor and then I have some garlic I'm just gonna take the garlic watch this just cut it straight across be careful keep your fingers out of the way and just mmm that's gonna be good in the turkey right there okay so now I'm gonna trust it up the thing about trusting is just to make sure that everything's tight together if there's a leg flapping out there it's gonna burn so you want to make sure that it's everything's all tight to the body of the bird so I'm going to tie up the legs and then pull its little tail so it'll took us it just want to tie the wing so it's tight to the body of the turkey the simpler it is the easier it's gonna be to get the string off when you're done so I know everybody thinks the turkey cooks all day but eight to ten pound bird 350 degrees don't cook in two hours I mean a chicken cooks in an hour and a half so this is gonna be really good creme brulee is the ultimate guide dessert make it and I'll follow you anywhere but tonight I'm making it for my girlfriend's creme brulee is this incredible creamy custard with a hard caramelized top absolutely delicious so three cups of cream I can't make creme brulee with that crap and I'm gonna scald it which means it's not gonna boil but they're gonna be little bubbles all the way around the outside and it's just under boiling so I need one whole egg into the mixer fitted with a paddle attachment which is what this is and I need four egg yolks [Music] half a cup of sugar I'm just going to turn the mixer on low and mix them just until they're combined you don't want to need frothy whippy stuff just until they're combined just like that and then I'm gonna add the scalded milk so I'm just gonna pour it really slowly into the eggs don't want scrambled eggs beginning to look like creme really just looks like a great custard so I'm just gonna flavor it with two things vanilla 1 teaspoon my love good vanilla my favorite and one tablespoon of Grand Marnier she's really orange flavored liqueur but would ever kind of look her you have around the house don't buy a whole bottle just for one tablespoon perfect then I put it into five ramekins or for my friends and I one extra for Jeffrey when he comes home it's the guy dessert thing [Music] a water bath will ensure that the custards cook evenly pitcher really helps so just bet halfway up the sides of the dishes so into the oven 300 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and then I'm gonna chill the custard and my friends and I are going to blowtorch the caramelized sugar together that's gonna be fun I'm off to get vegetables for the vegetable T on to go with the roast turkey love Jim pikes the best box down man [Music] [Music] vegetable TM I need three vegetables zucchini tomatoes and potatoes and the key is I need them all the same circumference so when I slice them they'll line up perfectly [Music] this punch mate is a perfect just the right circumference we need blossom [Music] potatoes these the red ones and I think I like the white ones and I want potatoes that have same diameter is the zucchini like this I have this vegetable tea on the first time and a friend's house in Provence first I'm gonna start with some onions I'm just gonna cook them for about 8 to 10 minutes until they're sort of starting to brown they're really soft and then I'm gonna add some garlic to it cook it for one more minute mmm I can already smell the garlic then I'm gonna turn off the heat and put the onions right into the bottom of the pan so it's gonna flavor all the vegetables on the top and now I'm gonna layer three vegetables on top so tomato potato zucchini and they can sort of stand up a little bit so it's got some thickness but only one layer so tomato potato zucchini and just keep going all the way around tomato potato zucchini see how important it is that the diameter of each of the vegetables is the same so it really looks gorgeous so that's it so I'm just gonna flavor it with some fresh thyme on the top just sort of sprinkle it around the top got a tablespoon and just so you know there's time on the top I love a few sprigs on the top salt and pepper generously because there are a lot of vegetables in here okay just a drizzle of olive oil and it helps the vegetables cook and the potatoes and the tomatoes and the zucchini all cook together which is just great crank this up to 375 together so I'm gonna bake it for 35 to 40 minutes gonna be tender and delicious I never feel like I'm ready for a party until I have the table set I kind of like having the dress ready pick some hydrangeas would be gorgeous so the place you want to actually cut the hydrangea it's right above where the smooth growth forms cut it just like that and then the new buds will form next year I think this one might be nice too right above that bud that's a good stock so there's three secrets to hydrangeas lasting a long time very hot water I cut right down the middle of the stem so it can drink as much water as possible and then take a knife and just run it down the outside of the edge and that'll help the hydrangea drink lots of water right into the water [Music] just a shock of color always makes it a little special and we're having turkey and vegetable tea on and pop over so pretty simple place setting of a fork a knife a spoon for dessert make sure everything's straight I think that's done oh I'm nice and hot okay half cups now take these sprigs of thyme off nobody needs to eat a stem put some grated Gruyere on the top and this is gonna hold it all together the starch and the potatoes is gonna hold it together but also that a little bit of Gruyere melted into it back into the oven uncovered for about 30 minutes until it all cooks together and it's perfectly tender and it's going to be really delicious little browned on the top with the cheese okay let's see how these creme brulees are I wanted to take them out when they're just set and they're perfect right now I just take them out really carefully [Music] perfect so it's gonna be the cold creamy custard and that hard crust of burnt sugar to be really good [Music] turkey smells like it's done two hours it's amazing isn't it smells looks fabulous so there's all kinds of ways to test whether the turkeys done the first one is to sort of shake its leg like shaking hands and if it moves a little bit it should be done everybody uses a thermometer but with the turkey I never know where to put it it's like 170 in one place 1:30 and another I think the easiest thing is just a little knife right between the leg and the thigh and if the juices run clear and they do it's done you actually want to put it under aluminum foil for about 20 minutes and let it rest really makes a difference in terms of how moist and juicy the turkey is I mean really good that's gonna be great with the tea on which I think I'll serve at room temperature okay the next thing is time popovers and what I've done is grease these popover parents are specifically used for popovers and I'm gonna preheat them for about two minutes in 425 degree oven okay popovers it's really like a pancake batter it's really easy to make and I've wanted to have cups of flour remember fluff it up and then just level it off and a half okay next is a little bit of salt 3/4 teaspoon of salt 3 eggs 1 everything room temperature make that a popovers always crack eggs into another Bowl just in case you get a bad egg you don't have to start all over again okay right in the middle make a little well three eggs why don't have cups of milk and just whisk this all together and then one and a half tablespoons of melted butter seems to be butter and everything doesn't it you don't want to too hot so you don't cook the eggs just a little bit perfect and I did this in a picture so it's easy to pour into the pans and then it's a little bit of fresh thyme like a tablespoon I've tried lots of different flavorings for popovers because I love them parmesan a little rosemary but the time is the one I like the best here okay right in last whisk really hot pans don't fill them more than half-full okay into the oven 425 degrees for exactly 30 minutes and remember no peeking [Music] so the trick is the resting for about 20 minutes and time to cargo [Music] [Music] [Music] that's pretty good so shall I have you have it a little turkey the herb and lemon and thyme butter [Music] little TM I love so which is might have a little career zucchini the only place okay I'm a little T on darling definitely cheesy and now the best part love a time pop over thank you Susannah loving Thank You Ashley so what was the last time you had Turkey what wasn't Thanksgiving it's really I think it's great yeah it's like making a big roast chicken know what's for dessert hmm it's a surprise and you have to make it yourself come with me [Music] boy have I got a treat for you they're vanilla custard but they might have a little Grand Marnier in it how about if we brulee the top so burnt sugar I'll show you how all right so I'm going to take a tablespoon of sugar and just put it right on the top of a cold custard and actually if you take your finger and run it along the top like that just to smooth it out so you get it all the way and this is the fun part so this is a little kitchen torch so you turn it on watch that that's tan am i that dangerous okay one nice and high to keep your hand away and you just hold it right down on the sugar and it'll burn it you don't have to put a blowtorch you can actually do it in the boiler but I just think it comes out much better this way and it's so much more fun and then you just let it chill for a minute and it hardens color like a hard caramel so that's what's it per second is gonna get really hard all right Shanae you're next good job is Ryan she's a pro if you think this looks like fun it is okay that's dessert excellent well done everybody cheers everyone Oh I love the contrast in texture who's the extra one Brian all I thought I might run for charity if it lasted [Music] bet that creme brulee Jeffrey will never know
[Music] I love entertaining on the beach so when my friends Joey and Maureen told me it was their dog Theo's birthday I thought what a great excuse for a party so I've invited lots of friends with their dogs to meet me at the beach the four-legged ones are gonna get these amazing treats and the humans what else hot dogs on the grill well not really hot dogs but grilled sausages in Funds piled high with sauteed onions and peppers plus a classic potato salad well with the volume turned up and what better to serve for drinks at the beach but sea breezes and for dessert a fabulous sheet cake with chocolate frosting and decorated with adorable dog cookies why no the dogs are going to have fun at the beach and with all that good food I bet the humans won't have a bad time either [Music] so we're off to the beach with the dogs and since we're having hot dogs or chicken sausages I thought what would be more perfect with it then really good potato salad so the potatoes are done I'm just gonna drain them so I cook them for about ten minutes and then I let them steam for another ten minutes so that's three pounds of new potatoes it's a small ones you can use red ones or white ones whichever you like and I'm just going to let them steam and the steam really gets into the potatoes and cooks them beautifully so next I'm gonna make the sauce so one cup of mayonnaise quarter of a cup of buttermilk or white wine or chicken stock whatever you have just whisk it together until it's creamy so having some kind of liquid to mayonnaise takes away that sort of gloppy flavor and it makes it more like a sauce now I'm gonna add lots of flavor two tablespoons of Dijon mustard two tablespoons of coarse mustard it's this grainy mustard really has great flavor and it also looks like mustard so you know exactly what's in it and then lots of fresh dill about a half a cup of chopped fresh dill if you don't like tell you can always use parsley or something like that but I really like doing this it gives it lots of flavor so just chop off the leaves chopped it up roughly mmm smells like summer to me and that should be about a half a cup teaspoon of salt teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna whisk this all together and I've got the sauce actually I'm a summer you can make a huge amount of this if you're having a potato salad a lot and then just use it as you make the potatoes don't leave it in the fridge okay potatoes should be ready so it's gonna clean up a little bit and see how they are perfect and they look beautiful so I'm gonna cut up the potatoes and just gonna quarter these guys if they're really big you can cut them in smaller pieces but quarters are just about right I used small round potatoes so you use the skins they're very thin-skinned and actually the skins have a lot of nutrition in them so it's really worth keeping I also love the way it looks I think it's much easier looking it's gonna be great I'm gonna pack it and Chinese containers and everybody have their own little potato salad at the beach okay that's it for the potatoes so I'm gonna let them cool a little bit well I chopped up some celery and red onion for it one of the things that's really important for me when I'm making salads it's not just the flavor and the color but also the texture and with this salads really nice to have a little bit of a crunch with the celery and red onions so I need might be about a half a cup of celery and red onion in this just nice rough chop remember this is a homemade salad it's supposed to look like a homemade salad don't obsess about having perfect sized pieces that's crazy [Music] when you're cutting red onion leave the back part attached keep your fingers out of the way just do slices like that and then straight down really let the blade do the work by moving rather than pushing it move the blade half a cup of red onion that's gonna give a nice flavor okay I think the potatoes are cool enough so I'm gonna put the dressing on toss it all together this is great salad cuz if it sits a little bit really absorbs into the flavor of the potatoes mmm this looks good and then tossing all the red onion and celery give it lots of crunch and flavor Oh looks really good I'm actually not gonna check it for seasonings right now because it's warm and it's gonna be served cold it's better to check the seasonings when it's the temperature you're gonna eat it so I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator and pack it up later and take it to the beach and now I'm off to the beach to find the perfect spot for the party [Music] hi Joey how's the birthday boy he is so excited about this party Mandy I'm just looking around to see what we should set up I thought somewhere maybe down by the water in front of the pavilion how does that sound to you sounds fabulous okay will you call everybody it's on the word to me I'll bring all the food and the cocktails we're having hot dogs very funny ina the dogs will never get the joke [Music] I don't know who's gonna have more fun at this party the people are the pooches so I'm gonna make the grilled sausage the hot dogs and of course we can do mustard and ketchup and all those things but I thought be so much better to have sauteed onions and peppers to put on them so I'm gonna make a big pot of it bring it to the beach and then heat it up on the grill so I need lots of onions I'm using Spanish onions those big ones that you can find in the store just big half rounds of Spanish onions I've got oil heating up in the pan and then I'm just gonna put this big pile of onions in it's about 10 cups of onions okay I'm just gonna let those cook for about 15 to 20 minutes until they're browned and sweet and Cara moss and they'll be reduced millionaire's peppers and flavorings while that's cooking I'm gonna get the other things ready so it's to red peppers it's good idea to keep an eye on the onions where they're starting to brown they look great okay that's two yellow peppers and the onions it's the whole house not great I'm gonna make some garlic and then this would be done just stick with the garlic right in the pan I don't cook garlic very long just for 3060 seconds these onions look amazing they're browned and caramelized and the bottom of the pan is all crusty and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take some sherry vinegar and deglaze the pan it'll get all that great flavor I think about a quarter of a cup of sherry vinegar that's gonna get up all that brown scrapings on the bottom sherry woman vinegar and the onions are fabulous together okay now all the peppers go in [Music] I'm gonna add some tomato paste think that tablespoon should be good and some crushed red pepper flakes I don't like things too spicy so I'm just gonna add about a half a teaspoon so I'll start with a teaspoon and see how it goes and pepper 1/2 a teaspoon okay I'm just gonna let this simmer Wayne until it gets reduced and sweet and delicious it's gonna be so good with the chicken sausages now for the main event the birthday cake not for the dogs for the people [Music] I need two hundred quarter sticks of butter I need three cups of sugar and while they're creaming I'm gonna get the rest of the ingredients together [Music] okay the butter and sugar really well creamed they're light and fluffy gets really a light yellow color just gonna scrape down the bowl to make sure it's not sticking to the bottom okay and then with a mixer on low when I add the eggs one at a time just make sure they get really well incorporated it's gonna make a huge cake whatever reason he gets them to take home next the zest of one lemon it's a right cake but there's a little bit of lemon really gives it lots of flavor one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla [Applause] and what type of sour cream this one keeps it really moist it's an 8 ounce container hmm it's already smells good okay now for the dry ingredients first thing is three cups of flour any all-purpose flour I use unbleached flour whatever you have cornstarch third of a cup this basically approximates cake flour makes it nice and light teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of salt just set that all together okay I'm very low speed I'm just going to add the dry ingredients to the wet ones and mix it just until it's blended make sure it's really well mixed mmm can really smell the lemon and I just think makes us such a difference because it a very fresh flavor without being lemony so this is a half sheet pan is 12 by 18 and about one and a quarter inches deep it's gonna get them in any cookware stores just pour the batter in this is a really useful batter I make cupcakes out of them I make small cakes out of it sometimes I've flavored a little bit with orange and lemon just spread it out evenly and then later I'm gonna just cover the whole thing with the most gorgeous chocolate frosting and you won't believe the decorations I found for them nice and smooth into the oven 25 to 30 minutes 350 degrees and it's going to be a knockout cake [Music] so for my pooch party the dogs are gonna have dog biscuits and water but the humans are having chicken sausage potato salad and birthday cake for dessert so I'm gonna do a chocolate icing for my white cake first thing I need is 24 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips mmm already smells good why don't have cups of heavy cream and just let the chocolate melt over double boiler simmering water I don't want it to get too hot because otherwise the chocolate will separate not pretty I just chopped the chips but if you want to use bars of chocolate that's fine to just make sweet chocolate actually the more you stir it the shinier it gets it makes a really nice frosting okay so off the heat I'm gonna add two tablespoons of corn syrup actually keeps the frosting spreadable Florida 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla actually gonna check it off the double boiler so it goes down pretty fast because I'm gonna have to let it cool a little bit before I add the butter make the buttercream so I'm just gonna stir that in and now wait do you see what I have to decorate this cake with so I was trying to think how am I gonna decorate a cake for humans that's a dog party and I found these amazing cookies wait do you see them they just admit I love them it's a little fire hydrant and they're great dogs and so I'm going to decorate the cake with them just so the dogs don't feel left out I've got wonderful things for the dogs to cook these they look like cookies and they really don't biscuits okay time to ice the cake so I have the cool chocolate it's really nice and thick just wonderful I'm gonna pour it into the mixer that's a lot of chocolate but it's a lot of cake too it's always so dramatic to have a huge cake and it's not that expensive a half a stick of room-temperature butter I'm just gonna beat this together until it's light and fluffy and it's a nice buttercream okay that should do it nice and thick oh it's gorgeous now I'm spread it on the cake you want to be sure the cake is nice and cool when you do this otherwise you let me talk like a mess [Music] okay just spread it out evenly this is a great frosting for cupcakes and for chocolate cakes but I just thought in this case a nice white sheet cake would be really fun perfect except to make sure the icing is good so chocolatey it's just delicious okay now we're gonna decorate this well we have to start with a fire hydrant right right there and I think the dogs are gonna be all lined up don't you this is so great okay and what I think this guy is pretty cute that's gonna go right there and I love him that's my courage right there I think we might have a cat in there little cat in the middle and a little black one little guy and right there okay how great does that look I'd say that's a treat for the humans and I've got treats for the dogs everybody's gonna be happy now I'm gonna pack everything up and I'm off to the beach [Music] I say they're having a good time so am i I'm making chicken sausages on the grill I just thought they'd be really flavorful he's sort of like having hot dogs but not and then I'm gonna have a sauteed onions and red peppers to top them off it's gonna be really good dinner this is good enough to eat so it was a challenge growing on the beach but I'm always surprised how great it feels when it comes out right and what I have here is I have the sauteed peppers and onions and I'm heating up on this other grill and they're heating up really fast oh they look great it's really really good on the sausages [Music] sea breezes are really easy it's two parts cranberry juice1 part grapefruit juice and one part vodka that's the good part [Music] shake it up and serve it with some line kind of warned my buds and I'm not kidding dinner's ready okay everybody dinner's ready come on over it went straight for the main course chicken sausage really mess that you think it's chicken sausage with peppers and onions ambulance chicken sausage and sausage to live who need to explain why you've got the better themselves sausage excellent with peppers and they're like okay [Music] yeah you know that's the old fashioned American potato salad decade nothing who wants birthday cake you can use it's right here your get the hydrant right okay take anymore [Music] I'm gonna be celebrating Gio's birthday every year [Applause] [Applause] [Music]
[Music] somebody really important is coming for dinner and just let me think I'm going to make a fancy meal I'm going to do exactly the opposite turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes mmm who wouldn't love that so you know that time when somebody really important is coming to dinner maybe it's your boss or Julia Child that would be scary to me and you want to make something really special that's just the time that I make something that's really good comfort food and I serve it in the kitchen and it's relaxed and everybody has a good time so tonight my book editor is coming of course it has to be wonderful so I'm going to make turkey meatloaf parmesan some mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts and we're gonna have a great time at the kitchen table so for the turkey meatloaf I've already sauteed 2 large onions and some olive oil salt and pepper and some fresh thyme then I got out of my garden I love the smell of fresh thyme I love it in the turkey meatloaf just take it off the stem like that so I cooked it all together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and they're just cooked through but not browned and then I'm going to add some other ingredients to make it a variable I'm actually you can do this off the heat what's your shoe sauce chicken stock and some tomato paste so about 1/3 of a cup of Worcestershire sauce 3/4 of a cup of chicken stock I've homemade chicken stock but you can use a good can chicken stock and these good tomato paste really thick it'll add a lot of flavor that wanted to have two spoons I'm just going to mix that all together this is the kind of meatloaf even your husband won't believe it's not beef it's delicious so this is ground turkey it's actually better for you than ground beef and it's not you can get get it at the butcher he's going to say to you you want white 5 pounds of ground turkey it's a lot you can always cut the recipe in half but I think why not make a large quantity and you can always have it for sandwiches so I want to take all this wonderful flavoring dump it into the turkey meatloaf put in one and a half cups of plain breadcrumbs I just use package breadcrumbs they taste just as good in this recipe as homemade ones and there's so much easier and then 3 eggs and that's going to hold the mixture together this is great in the winter serve top it's also wonderful in the summer serve cold with a green salad and of course when there's lots of turkey meat love my husband's very happy because I make a meatloaf sandwiches for lunch I'm just going to pour this on top and that comes a really squishy part clean hands I'm going to just mix all this together I want to do a really lightly I don't want to pack it down so I'm going to do a really fingertip II just mix it together it Whitely until all the onions and the Worcestershire sauce and the breadcrumbs are mixed in with the turkey okay that's it nicely mixed and now all I'm going to do with really messy hands is dump it out on this pan and shape it into the meatloaf this is a really freeform meatloaf shape so I'm going to make it into a neat loaf so that's it later I'm going to pour ketchup on the top which is going to give it lots of flavor I'm going to put it in the fridge and right now I'm going shopping [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Sandy oh yeah so I think I need six browning need let's see three with nuts and free without that okay how's that yeah great I can make these myself but my friends aren't going to have more fun if I spend the day making outrageous brownie so I'm going to buy them here thanks so much handle whoop we're done so all I have to do is finish the turkey meatloaf I've got everything together here the ground turkey with onions and Worcestershire sauce and just wonderful flavorings and I'm going to put ketchup over the top of it to keep it really moist and delicious how homey is that great okay so this goes in the oven 325 for about an hour and a half and I'll show you a trick to keeping it from cracking I hate when turkey meatloaf cracks on the top and the trick is take a pan of hot water and put it underneath the turkey meatloaf and it'll keep steam in the oven and keep the meat from cracking so some hot water from the tap is perfect and that's going to be delicious if you're like me and you hate those mushy things from Thanksgiving boiled Brussels sprouts you'll love this recipe I cook the Brussels sprouts at a really high temperature 400 degrees with lots of salt and they're crisp on the outside and really tender on the inside and there's sort of more like french fries and they are like Brussels sprouts so I'm just taking off the ends of these Brussels sprouts just a little bit so it's not brown and any outside leaves that aren't gorgeous great so all I'm going to do is drizzle it with olive oil toss it with salt and pepper and into the oven it goes let's people do this in a bowl I just do it right on the baking sheet 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes and these are going to be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside that's one creaky oven when people come to my house I set up the drinks on a bar in the living room and then everybody can help themselves I hate when people are arriving I feel like race to the door race back to the drinks and this way everybody sort of connects while they're making themselves a drink just really what entertaining is about and then I'll have little things for people to eat to pistachio instead of spending the entire day making things are absolutely fine logo I just have a little nibble for people it's totally delicious and some gorgeous potato chips then I've got all the drinks set up just something simple like scotch and Soda everybody can help themselves and one last little detail which I love is when I set up the candles I get clothed whole clothes that are really spicy and wonderful and I step in and the bottom and then when you light the candle you can smell that wonderful Clovis is like having apple pies baking and later I'm going to make house of houses and now I'm going to make Provencal tomato what I'm going to do here is mix herbs breadcrumbs that I'm going to stuff these tomatoes with and then bake them with a little bit of gray air and I'm so good just put them in the food processor and I'll make fresh breadcrumbs fresh breadcrumbs are lighter and when I flavor them it's important to make them yourself as opposed to the dry breadcrumbs it opens into the turkey meatloaf put them in here this is where the Provencal part comes in so I'm going to chop up all these gorgeous herbs and add them to the breadcrumbs before I put them in the tomatoes so I need scallions and I use the white and the green part I think I like the color and the flavor of those okay so two scallions all chopped up right in some fresh basil leaves just chop them up lots of fresh basil how is your monster pesto a little fresh basil and then some parsley just cut it right off the stem that's a great thing to put together you always have some white bread and whatever herbs you have in the fridge okay parsley and fresh thyme and then the last thing is garlic and claw maybe to close the garlic should do it [Applause] this said big one so we're just going to use one clove of garlic okay so that's the breadcrumbs salt and pepper and I'm just going to toss this with my hands look how beautiful it is that's the breadcrumb part now we'll get the tomatoes ready so these are tomatoes I love to buy them on the vine I chose committees that are a little bit smaller not those big ones that you get in the middle of this summer and the one thing that's great about this recipe is it's really good with winter Tomatoes because by the time you roast them they taste delicious just going to take a little bit out of the core and then cut the entire tomato and a half I'm going to take all these seeds and pick the seeds out of the tomato because those are the crevices that I'm going to fill with a breadcrumb mixture let's sprinkle with a little salt and pepper and I want to fill it with those wonderful breadcrumbs take each tomato and just fill the crevices with these wonderful breadcrumbs with garlic and basil thyme parsley that's it look great and the last guy just enough just a little left these are going to bake for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees and then I'm going to sprinkle Gruyere cheese and let it melt for a minute over the top and now I'm going to make parmesan smashed potatoes so my book editor is coming for dinner and it's got to be good so instead of making something fancy I'm making something very earthy turkey meatloaf and to go with it my Provencal Tomatoes I just have to finish them so I've got these wonderful tomato halves that have been filled with breadcrumbs and herbs all those Provencal sort of spices garlic and basil parsley thyme and now what I'm going to do is just put a little bit of gray our cheese right on the top put them back in the oven for a minute I'm going to be even better it's going to grate it so I can put it on top where is like a Swiss cheese but I just think it has a little more flavor so you drizzle it with a little bit of olive oil just so it has great flavor it just puts in grier right on the top and it just goes back into the 400 degree oven for about 60 seconds so Parmesan smashed potatoes you won't believe how good these are I start with cooked new red potatoes so there are two secrets to why these are so good one is that I make it with the new potatoes with the skins on so you don't have to peel them and the second one is that it goes into the mixer instead of all of that potato ricing thing just put it into the mixer with a V Terron and just turned it on and they jump out of the mixer yes it get back in there so much easier and so much messier just mash them up just like that and then I'm going to put butter and cream in first I'm going to check the tomato [Music] no they're just great the cheese is melted and they look just delicious I'm leave them back here for later wonderful so I have here one and a half cups of half-and-half and a quarter of a pound of butter and I'm just going to pour enough in so that they get really creamy [Applause] and then we add half a cup of sour cream I know this is really wicked but it's really good and half a cup of Parmesan cheese oh it's great salt and pepper lots of salt salt pepper and we're looking for us for them to be creamy but sort of chunky I don't like them to be too smooth oh this looks wonderful very hot rather than keeping the potatoes warm in the oven I keep them warm over a double boiler and I find it doesn't dry up as much big bowl and just pour the potatoes in and they'll just stay hot and creamy for about a half an hour just like that and it's really easy and it's really good and the last thing I'm going to do is check my turkey meatloaf oh it looks like it's perfectly cooked it's not fabulous think there's enough and the Brussels sprouts they look great they're all crisp on the outside and I think I'm just going to leave them to warm in the oven with the oven turned off people sometimes don't remember what I make for dinner but they always remember dessert so I'm going to make something really special for my friends I'm going to do if everybody's going to have a brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and I'm going to make chocolate sauce for the top how fabulous is that mmm some of these brands have nuts and some don't for those that like it and they'll make the chocolate sauce this is really easy it's twelve ounces of chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate chips over a double boiler 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream wandering over simmering water so it doesn't get too hot and the last thing is really important I'm going to put about a teaspoon of instant espresso into the chocolate sauce and it's a huge difference in the way it tastes so I'm just going to let this sit over simmering water until it's just milk and then it can just rest there until we're ready to have dessert so my book editors coming for dinner and instead of making something really fancy I'm making something really earthy turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes I want it to be really fun and to make it even more fun we're going to have cotton poems this is a very Sex in the City drink so the recipe is 1 cup of vodka I'm going to put this beaker and then we'll shake them with ice [Music] good or ready right and half a cup of triple sec or Cointreau whichever you have half cup of cranberry juice how hard is this absolutely that color great and the last ingredient is fresh lime juice 1/4 of a cup of fresh lime juice love the color wonderful but ice in the shaker and then pour the cosmopolitan and shake and then pouring and then drinking do not look great that just looks like a party this one's mine oh we're going to have a good time and since the two girls are teenagers I have special cocktails for them maraschino cherry ginger ale it's going to look like a Manhattan and a little maraschino cherry juice but not look great and you stopping for coming all this way I've cocktail for everyone great son for Stevie and for Maya [Laughter] I said cheers everybody welcome thanks oh my god dinner's ready out of the oven smells good and Parmesan smashed potato maybe for the skins on oh good I am NOT yeah it was really chunky you know what my mother used to make me though it was so dry when I got married at home and ina said she was going to make meatloaf I very politely said I really rather have something else that she couldn't understand it then I realized it was a whole other way to make it so now I'm addicted therefore you're in big trouble of your mother ever use that story and Provencal tomatoes with basil and garlic and all kinds of protists all spices whatever baths or repetition get a bad rap brussel sprouts for jam with meatloaf Akash and jam thank you baby who knew Jeffrey boy didn't want any did you enjoy everybody this might actually enjoy it right sucessful isn't a totally different one that I've oiled ah you'll have to truly deliver nothing

[Music]
[Music] my friend Michael grooms having a really hectic day today so I've invited him for dinner tonight this is the time for good old-fashioned comfort food Michael actually grew up in a farm in Pennsylvania I understand as long as it's fabulous but I want to make it sour cream mashed potatoes I peeled them and cut them in big chunks I put them in salted boiling water for maybe about 10 to 15 minutes okay next thing I want to do is heat up a little bit of milk and butter when you have cups of milk 6 tablespoons of butter and meanwhile I'm going to get the potatoes pureed so this is called a food mill you can really find it in a hardware store or any kind of a cookware store and it's not very expensive so I'm just going to put the potatoes in I'll show you how to do work so you just turn the blade and you can turn it backwards just to clean the blade and then turn it again see how light and fluffy it is at the bottom you can use any kind of boiling potatoes Yukon Gold which are a little yellow which these are are the best one done okay I'm just going to whisk this into the potato just do it slowly don't do all of it at once I want to make sure that you have enough so that's creamy but not so much that it's soupy no potato soup okay now for a little depth of flavor better half a cup of sour cream two teaspoons of salt the better half a teaspoon of pepper this is really good Michael's gonna be very happy camper [Music]
[Music] my friend Frank has invited some friends to dinner tonight and I'm testing soup recipes all day so I said what are we join forces I'll bring soup to your house for dinner that way he doesn't have to cook and I can ro test my recipes the first tip is a really hearty lentil soup with spicy sausage and it's sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese the second recipe is a seafood stew that's full of shrimp and chunky fish just like the classic bluey bez but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] so for my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water intercept for my 15 minutes it just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make a big pot of soup and put them in and cook so I was with most soups I start with onions and this is a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions that's four cups of leeks there's a lot of soup I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because you can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months when tablespoon of chopped garlic there's been three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves who's gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good together lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just gonna cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's gonna be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is Karis keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually like it to look like it's homemade okay just big dice more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just gonna cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery it's gonna do it right down the middle I'm Barefoot Contessa we used to have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery you need to end up with like 200 quarts of soup it was really good okay so that's the carrots in the celery let me see if onions are ready no they're just simmering away here yeah perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender leaves okay now we're gonna add all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be really hard a soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s that was considered like hippie vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown have more flavor next a chicken stock how many chicken stock you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken stock and it's so easy to make so I have three quarts you'll go right in somehow I find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens in a pot with some carrots and celery thyme whole peppercorns it's so easy and I'm always in the kitchen for a couple of hours and it just boils away and then got a really good stock to make soups with I just keep it in the freezer and it's ready whenever I want to make soup okay so that's three quarts of chicken stock and then a quart of a cup of tomato paste gives it a lot of flavor it's surprising and last but not least lentils so this is a pound of lentils that I've soaked for about 15 minutes just pour them all in this is a big pot of soup so we're just gonna simmer this for about an hour all the flavors are gonna blend together and then it Franks has something to add spicy cabassa sausage and I'm gonna serve it with a drizzle of olive oil red wine and some Parmesan cheese delicious [Music] chive biscuits I thought they'd be wonderful with my soups making biscuits really is a lot like making scones the same sort of process so first I need two cups of flour and two my mixer [Music] the key to both of them is the butter you weren't really cold and you want it in big chunks so that they stay nice and light and fluffy one tablespoon of baking powder one teaspoon of salt [Music] put a sugar just a little bit of sweetness in them okay the next thing is butter so once take a very cold butter and we're going to dice it and then put it in the mixer and the mixers can do all the work [Music] okay I'm just gonna mix it until the butters about the size of peas okay in the meantime I need 3/4 of a cup of half-and-half who really make scones with any kind of savory herb like time would be wonderful or sage maybe for Thanksgiving make them let's say it's gonna be good with Turkey until that's ready only chop some chives line them up nice sharp knife who smells great it's a really delicate onion flavor it's gonna be good in the biscuits okay got a half a cup who's gonna put it in at the end so it doesn't get all smashed up have really fresh chive flavor okay that looks good I couldn't pour the cream in slowly with a mixer on it's a really wet dough but it's really delicious and the chives okay they're ready to roll out half a flower the board this is a really nice dough you really smell the chives too it's great good that's sticky this should make better eight biscuits just keep moving around on the board you know just want to make sure it doesn't stick and you can pat them out or you can roll the mat I was like you roll it up looks nice smooth even this I just think it's nice if you have something as simple as soup to have something a little special like homemade bread okay two and a half inch cutter just come out my pan these are great served on their own but they're also absolutely delicious sort of as a little sandwich like a forty or something I bet than that thing that's great exactly eight okay now I'm going to do a little egg wash make the tops nice and brown and a little bit of half-and-half just whisk it together that easy to do in a small bowl okay I'm just gonna brush the top slightly well these are gonna be just delicious with soups okay nothing like the smell of biscuits it's a 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're delicious chive biscuits with our soup I love a classic French boy abyss but it takes forever to make so instead I'm gonna make a sequence do with all the same flavors shellfish shrimp fish and it's gonna be so delicious I nail hi how are you I'm good Wow so I'm making a seafood stew can you get me a few things actually there are a lot of kinds of shrimp but why don't I take the clean ones all right so a pound of clean shrimp please then I could always peel them into vain them myself but why not get them already done there's a lot of work take some time exactly [Music] 24 muscles all right it's a great you're wonderful and I need a pound of halibut delay I need a pound of sea bass please all right you know there are a few things to look for when you're looking for fish and I think they're pretty standard one is that it doesn't smell very fishy and this I mean there's no fish smell here it's amazing and the other is that the eye of the fish is really bright that was really fast thanks so much Neil well it's gonna be great they do thank you oh joy bye-bye [Music] the second soup I want to test is a seafood stew so the first thing I'm gonna heat some oil and then cut up some onions two yellow onions oil is hot it's going to put the onions right in next I'm gonna do potatoes I need two cups of potatoes and these are you can go they have lots of flavor next the fennel I love bell it's got that wonderful anise flavor and when it's cooked not that crazy better it raw but when it's cooked and just there's a really delicate flavor so I'm just gonna chop this up this is a very provençal flavor and into the soup okay that's it for the panel two teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of pepper stir it all together let's gonna cook about 15 minutes so the vegetables and the potatoes are all tender in the meantime I need some seafood for the seafood stew [Music] lots of great seafood seafood stock so first thing I want to do is soak the mussels a little sand in the mussels and nobody needs stand in their seafood stew so fill it with water and then a handful of flour in the water just mix it around and what happens is the mussels break the water with the flour and they discourage any sand that they have inside so leave these to soak and I think seafood stood ready for a little wine two cups of a nice dry white wine you never cook with anything I wouldn't want to drink and seafood stock you can make it organ by it I need four cups which is a quart it smells good and one twenty ounce can of plum tomatoes pull them right in okay next I'm gonna add some garlic you got to have garlic and seafood stew sounds gonna chop it up three cloves 3 big cloves of garlic actually add this later in the stew so it doesn't burn okay three cloves of garlic right into the stew and then the truly Provencal ingredient is saffron it's the stamens of crocuses anyone she was really good whole saffron not the powdered kind and I'm gonna add one teaspoon which is all of this hill of saffron it really gives a full flavor and a little bit of spice to this do so this kind of just simmer for about 15 minutes while I get the seafood ready so I owe this great fish first I'm gonna start with the halibut just slice it in big chunks [Music] you always want to choose sort of firm flesh fish it's not gonna just disintegrate let's do the second one is the sea bass I'm just going to slice this across - so you want big enough chunks so they don't disintegrate but small enough ones I still actually cooking this doing pretty quickly okay next I'm gonna rinse the mussels first I'm just gonna check and see if any of them are open permanently since they're not alive and they all look gorgeous so they're fine a few times to make sure there's no flour perfect okay the last things the shrimp what am I glad I got this peeled and deveined so much work okay I think the students just about ready for the seafood this looks pretty good okay lots of fish [Music] dirt and it's gonna cook really fast now thanks to the shrimp this time so chunky and delicious full of flavors okay and last the mussels I love the color and the texture this makes but along the flavor it's gonna cook in about five minutes all the fish and the shrimp and mussels are gonna be done and then when I go to Frank's house I'm gonna add the two essential for your best ingredients there know and are obsessed so [Music] Frank's guests are arriving he's giving you the nice glass of white wine and I'm gonna just finish the soups love cooking in this kitchen so the seafood student he's a little bit of orange zest and some pear know I love those two flavors in the [Music] okay that should be about a tablespoon with the orange zest it's the soup this clash of Prayer no liquors flavor that really brings out the flavor of this film just mix it together this looks so gorgeous [Music] well that's ready they better be hungry they better not be having too much fun without me I'm gonna feel like Cinderella in the kitchen now okay one soup down one to go so I made lentil soup often but I just thought I'd experiment by putting sausage in it so I'm putting in kielbasa which is a cooked Polish sausage it's really good it's got some nice spice to it but this is really easy because you don't even have to cook it it's already smoked and cups and okay let's see how this lentil soup is doing Oh looks pretty good still this guy out [Music] wonderful so it's good but the sausage and all I have to do is just heat it through which will happen pretty fast it's a really hearty soup and I think adding the Cabasa really makes it like a meal both of these soups can meal themselves curious which one people are gonna like more a little splash of red wine or red wine vinegar and then I'm gonna serve it with a drizzle of olive oil cheese good and this is the stove could you kind of do this every night [Music] sausage sausage expand it's really good anything you said anything what would like a child Fiske and help yourself yes I'm testing recipes so I hope you like them on your beds depart Sunday like bottles who protests thank you for bringing guinea pig

I'm a big fan of trick desserts often called imposters we're a big treat is made to look like something it's not think about it the best way to eat which you like of Thanksgiving is pile up a huge fork full of the good stuff and eat it all together so these cupcakes basically do the work for you it's like a whole feast of one bite so I'm gonna make a bread pudding cupcake frosted with mashed potatoes torched off and topped with chives after Thanksgiving everybody has seen this sitting in the fridge leftover stuffing it's got bread it's got celery we've got the spices this is a great way to kind of reconstitute that stuff and make something really delicious out of it first thing I'm gonna do is take a cup of heavy cream 2 eggs with the salt the pepper so we whip this up and now we got a quick savory custard pace I'm gonna take all of my leftover stuffing alright you put that on the floor the dog can lick it out and now it's gonna match up the stuffing in the custard you want to let this custard soak in a little bit so once you get this all in here let it sit for just like 20 minutes or half an hour all right now you know prep the muffin pans and bake off our cupcakes for me to find a cupcake interesting it's got to be something you're not expecting and that is usually something that's either frosted with mashed potatoes or it has a bunch of cheese all over it so unlike a regular cupcake and when you put in the oven it's gonna rise these don't really move that much so whatever size they are when you put them in the oven that's the size they're gonna be able to take them out all right I'm gonna bake these off to 375 degrees for 15 minutes till they're a nice golden brown look it's either a muffin or it's a cupcake you know and you gotta pick one so you want to make cupcakes you got to do frosting so got some leftover mashed potatoes got a half a cup of cream got some butter a little bit of sour cream is gonna make this stuff a little more pliant we use a whip attachment now we don't want to turn these mashed potatoes of glue so be gentle so we're doing is we're adding a little bit more dairy to this just to make it so you can actually pipe this out and it looks good I also give us a little more flavor makes it a little more rich alright those are good now most cupcakes get sprinkles these cupcakes are gonna get chives you don't see me working with vegetables very often okay so got these nice chives I think our stuffing cupcakes are done these are nice and crispy and smell the butter so the custard is holding all this stuff together this is really easy you can totally do this mashed potatoes in the bag yup me I think mashed potatoes chives stuffing it's a nice combination on the plate take all we're missing is cranberry sauce and a little gravy now before you put the sprinkles on let's torch these things give us a nice crunchy texture also gives it a little bit more flavor now we can add the sprinkles mm-hmm they look awesome all right so that's one Thanksgiving me on a cupcake but I got a couple other ideas - I took leftover creamed spinach added custard to that baked it off and now I have these nice cupcake bases then I was thinking to myself with the frosting on my spinach cupcakes I'll do a feta cream in just a tiny tiny pinch of Hungarian paprika you know it looks like I got some leftover chives - why not that's a holiday cupcake but what about all that leftover bacon what are you gonna do with that why don't you make corn bread bacon cupcakes with a honey buttercream that is a handsome-looking group right there for these holiday recipes and more go to foodnetwork.com slash Duff's sweet spot you

Monday's they can be tough at work but surprisingly with shows like 24 and heroes on television it's an ideal night for friends to come over and have dinner my friends are cooked for me many times and unfortunately this day it is my time to cook dinner I only have one problem with that I'm just too damn lazy to cook dinner for anybody that's why I call this the real deal 30 minute meal you know you have Rachel rated her 30 minute meals that's true that have you ever really tried to make that 30 minute meal what do you have to do first of all you got to catch the show which is 30 minutes already you got to record that show and write everything down the store fight the traffic fight the lines of sort of bring on the food home cut it all up put it in nice little pretty Bowl and then by all the time you everything's all produced and laid out for you like it is on the show yeah it takes about 30 minutes but what's the real time two days so this is why I kind of put this little video to show people what they can do when it's their time to cook meal for their friends with everybody watching their weight these days you can't go to McDonald's and you can't go order out takeout Chinese phone they want to see the love and the hardship and the good values putting a strong meal at home so let me show you my 30 minute real deal first it starts with TV dinners if you see I bought marie callender's because marie callender's is known for their TV dinners which are tasty but also yet good for you they don't have to worry about 230 calories from fat saturated that's not really important is they're not going to know anyways so you start with the TV dinners the next thing you do is you got to get some tools to help make your meal look authentic did you really cook it how are they going to know what's going to really show them what I like to do is get one of my favorite pieces is corn on cob delicious frozen already pre-cut already taking this whatever the leaves are feeling not a cook I just know you put that in hot water and it gets done in about 5-10 minutes you get some bread cut and butter this put a little spice on it but some reason people feel like you really made a meal with these two things on the side and then the last thing you want to do this really tops all up like the icing on the cake good old parsley knife that a couple times put it on your plate and you're good to go people think it's funny and cute he made a meal for us and he put parsley on it too oh god this is going to be fun 30 minute real deal here we go okay now this is step two I have all the ingredients on the tables ready to go I'm pretty sure I already covered the fact that i am quite lazy but how lazy am I still lazy in fact that after I went out and bought TV dinners for my friend and I'm going to get my girlfriend that microwave them for me go ahead good no I don't know microwave them no babe you got to take the cardboard off I'm pretty sure no baby take the cardboard off get in a cola Micah they're taking them okay so here's the finished product we got ourselves hey Stevie dinner that's all the way cooked now see obviously you can't serve the dinner like this but it's an easy fix all you basically need is some sort of ceramic plate now from here to here for some reason this dinner starts to look a whole hell of a lot better first we take the chicken and we put it on the side there look at that I just cook that chicken Wow I'm a genius take the other piece of chicken go ahead and put it right there man I'm a culinary expert now we got some juices there that I can trickle on top of the chicken but you don't want to do that yet because it might look just a little bit nasty so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my hands I'm just going to grab that's hot in the more trying to keep it family here all right so that really hurt now we got mashed potatoes how we're going to get that over there some people like to use spoons maybe that's a smart thing to do but I'm just going to go ahead and use my hands i told you i was a lazy okay now see we got a lot of a real estate still on that plate but that's okay because right over here we have some corn cooking we have some bread making oh hi there as you can see we're almost done with our real deals 30-minute meals take a look doesn't that look fantastic you got a little space on each plate here for the bread take that up real nice and easy and of course it only took four minutes for each place to cook that's a grand total of sixteen minutes plus going to Thorne's about 30 minutes now you almost then once the parsley on because that makes you look like a hero oh how cute he is putting importantly in all the place but don't forget you gotta dispose of the evidence and that's the real deal 30 minute

now I'm gonna get myself all set up here to do this turkey show you real quick turkey breasts come out and into the pan then we're gonna get this skin off of the turkey and loosen it up that's where I have my small knife here to help me pull it off so that we can get the herbs in there beautiful let's get this guy going excellent now into that pocket I'm not even gonna use this spatula I'm gonna stuff lots of herbs see that coating it fold that down over the top grab another big handful of the parsley and sage mixture get it in there fold it down over the top I've got my butter melting up here I'm gonna use this to continually base the bird as well get the butter down over it that'll give it some great color - nice there we go salt and pepper again on top of the skin and then when we transfer it to the oven I'm gonna knock that oven back to 400 because I don't want the skin to get black on me I want it nice and crispy and perfect knock that back to 400 when did you ever cook on ol Thanksgiving turkey in less than an hour well I did because I cooked off two turkey breasts boneless turkey breast remember you get these right at the regular market go up and tell your butcher what you need and what you're thinking about look how gorgeous they are huh now just like with any other meat I've ever made on 30 Minute Meals you got to give it time to rest to let the juices distribute so I'm gonna take the turkey out and transfer to the serving platter look how gorgeous that is oh my god that gorgeous it's full of herbs you can see the herbs that we put underneath the skin it smells so fragrant and amazing I'm just going to pick out the bay leaves that we had in these pan drippings here because we need to get them out to make our gravy and I'm gonna put a little heat right underneath the pan that I roasted the turkey in to bring it up to temperature cuz I'm gonna turn these wonderful pan drippings into gravy so I'm gonna add a few tablespoons of flour so it can be our thickening agent I'm gonna whisk that in so we don't get lumps and there's not a lot of fat in there because of course we just made turkey breasts right I'm gonna let that cook for a minute I've got a nice bubble up on this I'm gonna season it up with a little salt and pepper Oh smells amazing and I've got all that nice turkey broth in there and it's gonna thicken up beautifully with my flour and now I'm gonna add a layer of flavor with the apple brandy don't worry about the alcohol in here it cooks right off just a splash of that in there and then let it reduce a minute it'll intensify the flavor and the alcohol burns right away and then chew that I'm gonna add some of the cider see that's the theme it layers into every course of our meal here Apple Apple Apple so it'll slightly sweeten our gravy too and make it really interesting well put the cap back on hello so get that in there oh yeah and just keep working that together this is just bubbling away I took the drippings from that because they were just full of good turkey flavor and not too much fat because it was just turkey breast right and I thickened it up with a little flour seasoned it up with a little salt and pepper then the theme ingredient of my Thanksgiving feast is apples so I doubled up on my apple flavor I added a little bit of apple brandy to it and let it cook out so I'd cook the alcohol off and concentrate the flavor of the brandy mmm oh man is that good one more grind of black pepper I think cuz it's super sweet cuz I also put apple cider in here what a nice surprise and look at the gorgeous brown color we got out of that gravy now I'm gonna get that into my gravy boat here just pour that off and into there oh look at the gloss and the color to that beautiful check out this turkey how gorgeous is this now remember these two and a half pound turkey breasts I started with two of them have layers of flavor going all around them herbs everywhere on the bottom of the pan I started with Evo oh and lots of fresh bay leaf as the oven heated up that bay leaf the flavor went up through the meat between the meat and the skin look at this look at all this green in here that's another layer of fresh herbs parsley and sage I combined that in a food processor with some lemon zest and some extra-virgin olive oil and then I put it in between the two and there's just flavor everywhere and look how nice and crispy it is that's because we put it into a super hot oven and then we basted it with even more herbaceous flavor melted butter with Bailey from the butter - isn't this gorgeous now the cool thing about this is that you could actually make three of these guys in the same amount of time you can make two of these guys just line them up in their roasting pan and then you can feed up to twelve people this right here - two and a half pound pieces of boneless turkey breast that would feed up to eight adults gorgeous isn't it really pretty
