hi guys I just want to make this really quick video just to show you some of the DIY Valentine's Day crafts / decorations that I made I normally don't decorate for Valentine's Day at all or like do anything for Valentine's Day um like to my house or whatever but a week or so ago I just really felt like making stuff and a Valentine's Day was coming up so I decided to make some Valentine's Day stuff and what's really great about all the stuff that I made is that I didn't spend any money at all zero dollars um I used stuff that I already had for everything so yeah I figured I would just show you what I did and maybe if you have the bug to also make something maybe these things will give you some ideas um I got the ideas from Pinterest alright so the first thing that I made is in this little thing hopefully you guys can see this I can't really say too well what I'm doing in the viewfinder because I member in my glasses so if I look like I'm squinting yeah that's why um but I made this little thing this glass jar I had from an olive oil they had olive oil in it so I saved it and cleaned it out and use it and I have bees inside of it you can see that the beads I had from something else everything I had from something else the hearts I cut out of scrapbook paper I just cut out a whole bunch of hearts um some more bigger and some are smaller and you can kind of see what I did there and the back does it look so cute it's just um you can see the other side of the dysgraphic paper and the silver things are pipe cleaners and I just hot glued the hearts to the five layers and I don't know I think it looks really cute I just tied like a little twine thing around the top so yeah that's my first little decoration alright the second thing I made is this this is just a paper heart tree thing I guess the paper hearts are all made out of construction paper I just use pink red and a little bit of white and it's a cone form inside and the code I cut out of scrapbook paper and I just taped it closed and I just hot glued all the hearts all over it um yeah and then I also like strung some so know if you guys can see but there's like bees on there um yeah they're just bees that I had from a really long time ago from like back when I was a kid and I just put them on some string and just like draped it around the tree to kind of make it a little bit prettier but yeah that's the second thing the next thing I made is this coffee filter wreath and this is just made from coffee filters red like red kids paint and cardboard the Bexar as the heart is cardboard you can see it there I will leave a link in the description for how to make this because I tried to explain this like three times already and I keep doing a terrible job so it's not hard to do what's really easy but it's just I can't talk today or something so I'll leave the link in the description if you want to know how to make this basically you just dye the coffee filters and then you stick them through the cardboard like that um I will be honest with you I wouldn't do i wouldn't do this craft again because it's hurt my fingers a lot like this was this took some work cutting out this cutting out the heart was kind of difficult because the cardboard was really thick so that was tricky and then twisting all the coffee filters kind of hurt my fingers too because you just have to keep doing the same thing over and over again it starts to hurt your fingers after a while actually I hadn't like take some breaks in between doing this it took me like two like two and a half days to finish this because my fingers started hurting but I mean I think it looks cute it's definitely one of those things that looks better from like far away if I hold it back here somewhere it looks better from far away up close if you look at it up close you can kind of see like the edge of the cardboard and you can like see through the filters and stuff um but for spending zero dollars on this I think it's pretty cute little Valentine's Day craft then I'm just going to hang this on our front door so yeah there's that the next thing I kind of made or put together is just I can never like hold things around the camera the right way it's just this thing here um this is just a jar like that globalist litter jars that I had made that I talked about in another video I just uh I'll show you I just cut out paper hearts and tape them to the jar can you guys see that am i holding this right in the game room um I just cut out some paper hearts and attach them with some twine to the jar I just think it makes it look kind of Valentine's Day ish and cute and then I just said it on this plate that I already had and on the plate it's just these like feed things that I have from last year I used these to decorate our Valentine's Day tree that I made last year I just put on the plate and put the candle in the middle of it and there you go a Valentine's Day decoration and the last thing that I did I don't even want to say that I made this because it's really not much at all I had this candle sitting on our our TV stand thing but the candle inside is orange and I just thought it looked like Follies like a fall handle so I want to cover up the orange color because it really doesn't go with like the season we're in right now so all I did was just take some old burlap that I had and some lace and just wrapped it around it and hot glued it so there you go now you can't see the orange candle it just looks like a cute little I don't know Febrary decoration that's everything maybe this video has given you some ideas if you want to make your own little Valentine's Day decorations give this video a thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe to my channel if you're not already thank you guys all so much for watching and I will see you all in my next video bye I probably shouldn't even try to explain it because yeah my goodness why can't I talk that we should show you really quickly the pillow cover my already seen it in the vlog but in case you didn't here it is so that's what it looks like it's really pretty just like red flower print
