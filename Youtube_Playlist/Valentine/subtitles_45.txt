hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I am super excited to team up with Nestle Tollhouse and bring you guys an amazing rainbow love heart surprise inside bundt cake this is perfect Valentine's Day but this is also an amazing cake to share all year round the things that you're going to need I'm using Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels today and I'm also going to use Nestle Tollhouse cocoa powder you'll need some food colorings and make them nice and bright and I've also got some flour I've got butter vanilla a little oil some eggs and I've got some sugar you'll also need some whipping cream and you leave all of your measurements down below as well as conversions depending on where you are and whether using self-raising flour or plain flour all-purpose flour with a little pinch of baking powder I've got a love heart cookie cutter some snacks your bags I've got a serrated bread knife and I'm using quite a large tray a cookie tray or a brownie tray that I've lined with some baking paper a bunt tin and I've got a bowl in a mixer over to the side let's get started the first thing you want to do is we're going to make up your vanilla cake this is my favorite recipe and we're going to do a double batch because we need quite a bit to make our rainbow love hearts so in goes my butter you want to put that in with your sugar and also your oil and vanilla we're going to beat that up until it's really nice and light and fluffy about three or four minutes once you happy that's nice and light and fluffy we're going to add in our eggs I'm going to leave all your measurements for this vanilla cake and separate it into the vanilla cake and the chocolate bundt cake on the my cupcake addiction website and I'll link to that post down below so make sure you check it out everything you need to bake this cake once your eggs or if you just want to give them a quick mix through make sure they're really really well combined again it's great to other sides of my bowl just to make sure that my mix is nice and evenly mixed and then you're going to add in your flour and your milk and we're going to mix it not too long here because we don't want to over develop the glutens in a vanilla cake so you just want to give it a quick mix until you can't see any more loose flour in there and everything's combined started off nice and slow so you don't end up with a massive dust storm beautiful my vanilla cake mixes lovely and thick and delicious and now I'm going to divide it evenly between six bowls it doesn't matter how much batter you have in each Bowl so long as they're all roughly the same once your batter is divided evenly into six bowls you want to color it six different colors and choose your favorites and mix the food coloring through make sure you go for really nice vibrant colors here once all of your colors a mixture you want to put each individual color into a separate snap seal bag you see roughly how much batter I've got so we're going to make a lot of stripy cake right now I'm going to start with my red I'm going to use a pair of scissors to cut off quite a thick chunky tip they're basically acting as piping bags so if you put a stack of piping bags feel free to use those but not many people have six of those laying around so I'm going to start by piping a nice thin line not too thin or you'll be half hours of my first color which for me is going to be red and then I'm moving on to orange cutting off the tip make sure it doesn't go into your cake and I love this particular cake recipe because you can see how kind of thick and chunky it is it holds its shape really well in one color doesn't bleed into the next you just want to keep on lining your vanilla layer cake in all the different colors and you'll notice once you get to the next layer once you finish your first full layer of cake you can actually start lining the exact same color again on top so you kind of end up with like a double thick line the cake batter recipe that I've given you works perfectly for a double batter in this tin and I'll leave dimensions for that down below that is one of the most amazingly vibrant cake batter trays I've ever seen that one's going to go from the oven and it's only going to take between 14 and 16 minutes to bake but you'll know it's done when you press lightly in the center and it springs back and doesn't sink look at this this is my version of heaven I love a good rainbow cake before I took that out I'm just going to take a knife and I just want to run around the outside edges we've got the baking paper on the bottom so I'm not too worried that I'm going to get into too much trouble with sticking I've also learned just a board with another bit of baking paper and I'm going to invert that onto my track making sure not to touch those hot edges and flip it as you lift that off you reveal the most amazing gorgeous vibrant striped rainbow cake this is how we get the rainbow strap technique inside our bunt I'm going to pop this off into the freezer I don't want it to be frozen solid but I want it to be really really nice and cool because that's going to make it a lot firm at a cup for your chocolate bundt I'm gonna take four ounces of my Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate morsels and I'm going to mix them together with a quarter cup of cream and microwave them on 30-second intervals stirring in between it's only gonna take about a minute but what I'm gonna create here is a really delicious semi-sweet chocolate a river with my chocolate syrup done and that's what's gonna make this boat cake super rich and fudgy I'm gonna take all of my cake ingredients now this is a super simple recipe because you really just pop it all together and mix so in goes my sugar my eggs and your egg should be at room temperature for best baking and rise results water also at room temperature I've got a little oil which helps to keep our cake really nice and moist my Nestle Tollhouse cocoa powder because this is going to be a chocolate cake I've got my butter now generally speaking all use salted butter if you don't have salted butter you can also use unsalted butter and just add a pinch of salt to your recipe a little bit of vanilla to really bring out that flavor and a little bit of flour with that baking powder already combined I'm going to mix that through before adding my chocolate syrup I'm you know poor in my next little house semi-sweet chocolate river mixture and this is going to make that color really dark and that flavor really fudgy with our chocolate cake mixture all mixed and ready to go you want to take some nonstick cooking spray and give the bundt in a really good spray don't forget to do the middle bit I always forget to do the middle bit so I'm gonna bake like about a half an inch just a really small amount of chocolate batter on the bottom of my bundt in which is actually gonna be the top of my bundt cake don't put too much here else you're not gonna have enough room for those love hearts to sit on top we're gonna bake this for about seven minutes so that it's par Becht and it gives our little love hearts a nice little flat spot to sit on and use most spatula just to spread it around a little bit and into the oven it goes well that goes baking you can take your cake out of the freezer it doesn't have to be frozen solid but freezing it makes it a lot easier to handle so I'm just going to flip it and that baking paper means it doesn't get stuck to my board peel off the baking paper on top and I'm gonna use a bread knife just to level it off so that all of my hearts are gonna be the same sort of height so just carefully just taking the very very top off this is always my favorite part of any rainbow cake because I just start lifting that take off you reveal the beautiful rainbow cake beneath without any oven browning or any of the edging of cakes it's just stunning now that I've revealed my beautiful cake and leveled it off I'm going to use my love heart cookie cutter and you can actually do this with any shape but I love how it's really nice and easy to balance back in our bunt tin so I'm going to cut love heart shapes as close together as I can and as I do it I'm trying to make sure that I get all of the colors of the rainbow in my love heart so when you're picking your cookie cutter you need to pick one that's going to fit inside your bunt in nicely but that's also going to be able to capture all of those beautiful rainbow colors you're gonna need a lot of these love hearts so keep cutting until you've used up all of your cake you can see how firm that cake is so setting it in the freezer for a little bit really makes it a lot easier to cut and especially if you start to push it out of those get cut as it stops it from crumbling now we want those frozen solid so while our bunt is baking our hearts are freezing and it's time to start thinking about assembly now with my bundt cake nice and kind of baked I'm going to take my raw butter and I'm gonna put a little bit more of that on top it's gonna kind of act like a bit of a glue so I'm just gonna use my spatula and just kind of smear it on its going to melt a little bit because it's raw cake going on to kind of warm hot cake you don't need too much here I'm going to take my little frozen love hearts now so there's a really really nice firm and solid and I'm going to place them upside down all the way around that bundt cake kind of in the middle as much as you can leave a little tiny gap in between each of them because otherwise they're not going to kind of sit in properly in your round shape perfect you've got all of your little love hearts kind of lined up I've got my chocolate cake batter in a large piping bag and this is just so that I can get a really neat fill so I'm going to come in and I'm going to fill between my hearts making sure that I'm giving them each a little bit of personal space this is a beautiful effect because every slice of Funt cake you're going to get rain bowl of hot chocolate rain bowl of hot chocolate so it really makes for a beautiful surprising side effect coming down to the inside and I'm really really squeezing that chocolate cake batter in there because I want to make sure that I don't end up with any gaps or air bubbles inside my cake when I first tried a twice baked cake technique I wasn't 100% sure how cake would go being baked twice in the oven I was absolutely sure that it would come out dry but the moist cake around the outside actually protects it and the fact that we've got a little bit of oil in both of these cake mixes means they're a little bit moist us straight from the get-go I'm going to use my spatula now and I'm just going to just smooth that around but you don't want to overfill your bundt tin be really gentle here we don't want to disturb the points of our love heart I'm going to give my bunt a couple of just soft taps on the bench to make sure that chocolate cake mixtures gone all the way down and that is going off into a moderate oven for about 30 minutes but you'll know it's done when you touch around the outside edges not the middle the outside edges or the inside edges and it springs back when touched so my bundt cake is baked to perfection it looks fantastic but before I take that out I'm going to let it sit in that bunk tin for 15 minutes that's going to allow to sweat a little bit which will help it release really easily when I go to turn it out in the meantime because we can frost this one up warm I'm gonna make a really simple ganache using my Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels I opted for semi-sweet right the way throughout this cake but specifically for the ganache because the cake itself is quite sweet and this is going to take away from that super sweetness of like a milk chocolate feel free to switch it out if you're a milk fan or if you'd like something a little bit darker to make my ganache I'm just going to take my cream and I'm going to pour it over the top of my Nestle Tollhouse chocolate morsels and then that's going to go into the microwave 30-second intervals stirring really well in between it should only take about a minute and we're looking for a beautiful smooth glossy river of chocolate now I'm going to take my buns and I'm going to put it straight into a cake board but to do this I'm going to turn the cake board upside down stick it on top of the tin fill the tin to make sure it's not so hot and then I'm going to flip it I'm going to let the weight of the bundt pull down so that I've kind of not having to do too much to get it out and there's our bundt cake looking rather like an unassuming boring chocolate bun but it's going to be anything but when we cut into it just giving my ganache quick stir around to make sure it's glossy and smooth and silky and I'm going to spoon it on because I want it to kind of gather in little pools around the bottom of my bundt has nothing better than the smell of a rich slightly dark chocolaty ganache I always like to give ganache a couple of taps just to smooth it out a little bit not too hard because I definitely don't want a broken cake stand but essentially this is your surprise inside rainbow love hard bunt this is always the part that makes me the most excited but also the most nervous because you never know what's been going on here until you actually cut it's the moment of truth so when we cut in slicing down the cake feels amazing it's so soft and spongy we did it we made not your Nana's bundt cake I love this guy because it's so unassuming and when you arrive at the party with just another bundt cake and then people cut into it they're going to be amazed at how we got a rainbow-striped love heart baked right inside and beyond excited about how this turned out for me this is the ultimate Valentine's Day cake it says love it says rainbow and it's smothered in chocolate it doesn't really get much better than that bear in mind when you're serving this not every single slice is going to have the exact amount of rainbow because we did have those little gaps of chocolate so with your first slice make sure that you have a beautiful amount of rainbow on both sides of your piece and then cut even sized pieces around the bundt cake which will help you to keep that even rainbow look on all of your pieces throughout a big THANK YOU to Nestle Tollhouse for teaming up with me on today's video I had so much fun coming up with an average bundt cake that's
