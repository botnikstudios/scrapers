hello you guys so today I'm going to show you how to make my strawberry Valentine's Day tart this is so simple to put together it's so stunning it is gorgeous and I'll also be sharing with you my tips on how to make perfect chocolate strawberries your loved one will be amazed by this tart yeah that being said a little get started and let's make this [Music] okay so we're going to make the crust first in my bowl I have some crushed cookies you can use any cookies you prefer guys I love to use Oreos if you are using different cookies though just keep in mind that every cookie absorbs liquids differently so you might need less or more butter and you'll have to adjust anyway you're looking for a wet sand like texture and you're going to transfer this mixture into a greased car pan if you don't have one you can use the pie plates that would also work perfectly distribute your crust evenly press it firmly together using your hands or spoon and you're going to put this in the fridge to set while we make our chocolate covered strawberries you'll need some white chocolate or any chocolate you prefer you're going to pop that into the microwave stirring it every 20-30 seconds do not let it melt completely leave a couple of chunks stir and they will melt as well add a teaspoon of coconut oil you can actually add this at the beginning I just forgot so I'm adding it now this will create a thinner chocolate coating a thinner chocolate shell now I'm going to dye mine white and pink I'm adding white just because I want to light baby pink color but as always guys you do not have to do this I just think that pink and red are so lovely together anyway I'm going to transfer this into another Bowl sometimes you know food coloring can stick to the sides of your bowl and it's good to transfer it that way you don't get streaks of food coloring in your final product now this is pretty self-explanatory however I do want to say two important things make sure your strawberries are completely dry after you've washed them and before dipping them into the chocolate you also want to use cold strawberries that you have just taken out of the fridge and your chocolate should solidify within 15-20 seconds without putting your strawberries into the fridge gently place them onto your parchment paper and let them finish drying this way do not put these into the fridge because what might happen is your chocolate may become a very dull color and you don't want that also if you can use preferably bite size strawberries just because we're making a tart and you're going to be eating you know both the tart and the straw with your fork and it's just easier to eat them if they're small if you can find them guys it's perfectly okay okay so for the nobec filling it's just chocolate ganache like I said many times before it is so versatile and trust me it is so good for this recipe you can add a bit of brandy or any other type of alcohol you like or just keep it simple anyway all I did was mix my hot heavy cream you want the cream to come to a simmer pour it over your chocolate let it stand for about 30 seconds and then you can start you're going to pour this amazing chocolate liquid heaven into your tart pan if you see some smoke cloud it's just because I put my crust into the freezer anyway arrange your strawberries however you like there's no right way to do this it will look beautiful anyway you place your strawberries I'm also going to add some baby strawberries for a bit of contrast and color and size and also taste because they don't have a chocolate coating now cover this with plastic wrap you know just place it gently on top and this will sets just give it about 30 minutes or so but as I said do not refrigerate this chart this is such a gorgeous dessert guys this takes probably half an hour to make from start to finish but it's so beautiful that any one you make the floor will be so impressed the flavor is so delicious if you know me you know I'm not a big fan of chocolate and fruit together I just don't like the combination but this chart guys is just absolutely outstanding make this for your loved one make this for your family for your friends
