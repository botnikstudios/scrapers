hey guys it's kawaii sweet world and today we're making these really yummy Valentine's Day cake pops these are so delicious and they're really cute as well for Valentine's Day so let's get started here I have a pre baked yellow cake this is just a box mixed cake and I'm going to go ahead and cut it into quarters then I'm going to crumble this cake into a bowl so just rub the cake back and forth and then break it up with your fingers until you get nice little small pieces and now I'm adding in another cake quarter so that makes for a total of half a cake that I crumbled up now I'm adding in some vanilla frosting I ended up adding in about a third of a cup to get it to the right consistency so go ahead and mix it around you want it to be just moist enough so that you can pack it into a ball in your hands here I'm using an ice cream scoop to start forming the cake balls and I'm just going to go ahead and pack it a little bit and then roll it into a bowl you want these to be about one inch in diameter and then just place these on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper to make a heart-shaped cake pop go ahead and take a cake ball and flatten it out a little bit and then pinch the end into a v-shape then use one of your fingers to make a little indent in the top and I should have a cute little heart shape and here's all of our finished cake balls place this in the fridge for about 20 minutes now for the decorating you need some sprinkles along with some candy melts I'm using the Bolton brand here place these into a microwave-safe glass and I'm just going to melt these on a low power setting make sure you stir them every 20 seconds or so when it comes out it should look something like this nice and smooth now take some lollipop sticks and insert them into the candy melts about 1/2 an inch and then place this into your chilled cake ball here I'm doing the pink and the red some people like to refrigerate their cake pops at this time but I found that if you dip them when they're too cold your candy melts are going to crack and you don't want that and to make really thin even coating I found this Wilton easy thins product and it's really nice it's kind of like paramount crystal and it's really going to help thin out your candy coating you could also choose to use some vegetable oil or shortening but here I'm going to use the easy thins go ahead and add this into your candy coating well it's still warm and just stir it around to melt this is going to make your candy coating nice and smooth and thin now we're ready to dip our cake bucks here I'm doing the white candy coating and then just tap off the excess and then for this one I'm adding a little heart sprinkle you can see how adorable this looks or you could choose to cover your entire cake cup with sprinkles this is one of my favorite looks because I think it looks so fun and festive for Valentine's Day and here's of the finished product will look like and here I'm doing some of my red cake pops you may have to remelt your candy coating a little bit but just make sure you do this on a low power and I'm adding on a sprinkle for this one too I have this really nice cake pop stand that I got from Target you could also use a styrofoam block to place your cake pops in to dry and here I'm doing the Hart cake pop you might have to rock it around in the candy coating a little bit to get it all coated but just be gentle when you're doing this and you can see these are really adorable as well and here I'm just going to drizzle it with some melted candy coating make sure you add in some canola oil to thin this out though as you can see I got some really thick lines it looks almost like a zebra print but I think it's so cute and if you want to add an extra touch go ahead and add a plastic treat bag I got mine at Michaels and just go ahead and tie it off with a bow I think that this makes it a really cute gift for a friend and that's it these cake pops are really easy to make and if you've never had cake pops before they just taste like a really moist cake so I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to share your creations with me on my Facebook page and I'll see you guys next time happy Valentine's Dayhi guys I just want to make this really quick video just to show you some of the DIY Valentine's Day crafts / decorations that I made I normally don't decorate for Valentine's Day at all or like do anything for Valentine's Day um like to my house or whatever but a week or so ago I just really felt like making stuff and a Valentine's Day was coming up so I decided to make some Valentine's Day stuff and what's really great about all the stuff that I made is that I didn't spend any money at all zero dollars um I used stuff that I already had for everything so yeah I figured I would just show you what I did and maybe if you have the bug to also make something maybe these things will give you some ideas um I got the ideas from Pinterest alright so the first thing that I made is in this little thing hopefully you guys can see this I can't really say too well what I'm doing in the viewfinder because I member in my glasses so if I look like I'm squinting yeah that's why um but I made this little thing this glass jar I had from an olive oil they had olive oil in it so I saved it and cleaned it out and use it and I have bees inside of it you can see that the beads I had from something else everything I had from something else the hearts I cut out of scrapbook paper I just cut out a whole bunch of hearts um some more bigger and some are smaller and you can kind of see what I did there and the back does it look so cute it's just um you can see the other side of the dysgraphic paper and the silver things are pipe cleaners and I just hot glued the hearts to the five layers and I don't know I think it looks really cute I just tied like a little twine thing around the top so yeah that's my first little decoration alright the second thing I made is this this is just a paper heart tree thing I guess the paper hearts are all made out of construction paper I just use pink red and a little bit of white and it's a cone form inside and the code I cut out of scrapbook paper and I just taped it closed and I just hot glued all the hearts all over it um yeah and then I also like strung some so know if you guys can see but there's like bees on there um yeah they're just bees that I had from a really long time ago from like back when I was a kid and I just put them on some string and just like draped it around the tree to kind of make it a little bit prettier but yeah that's the second thing the next thing I made is this coffee filter wreath and this is just made from coffee filters red like red kids paint and cardboard the Bexar as the heart is cardboard you can see it there I will leave a link in the description for how to make this because I tried to explain this like three times already and I keep doing a terrible job so it's not hard to do what's really easy but it's just I can't talk today or something so I'll leave the link in the description if you want to know how to make this basically you just dye the coffee filters and then you stick them through the cardboard like that um I will be honest with you I wouldn't do i wouldn't do this craft again because it's hurt my fingers a lot like this was this took some work cutting out this cutting out the heart was kind of difficult because the cardboard was really thick so that was tricky and then twisting all the coffee filters kind of hurt my fingers too because you just have to keep doing the same thing over and over again it starts to hurt your fingers after a while actually I hadn't like take some breaks in between doing this it took me like two like two and a half days to finish this because my fingers started hurting but I mean I think it looks cute it's definitely one of those things that looks better from like far away if I hold it back here somewhere it looks better from far away up close if you look at it up close you can kind of see like the edge of the cardboard and you can like see through the filters and stuff um but for spending zero dollars on this I think it's pretty cute little Valentine's Day craft then I'm just going to hang this on our front door so yeah there's that the next thing I kind of made or put together is just I can never like hold things around the camera the right way it's just this thing here um this is just a jar like that globalist litter jars that I had made that I talked about in another video I just uh I'll show you I just cut out paper hearts and tape them to the jar can you guys see that am i holding this right in the game room um I just cut out some paper hearts and attach them with some twine to the jar I just think it makes it look kind of Valentine's Day ish and cute and then I just said it on this plate that I already had and on the plate it's just these like feed things that I have from last year I used these to decorate our Valentine's Day tree that I made last year I just put on the plate and put the candle in the middle of it and there you go a Valentine's Day decoration and the last thing that I did I don't even want to say that I made this because it's really not much at all I had this candle sitting on our our TV stand thing but the candle inside is orange and I just thought it looked like Follies like a fall handle so I want to cover up the orange color because it really doesn't go with like the season we're in right now so all I did was just take some old burlap that I had and some lace and just wrapped it around it and hot glued it so there you go now you can't see the orange candle it just looks like a cute little I don't know Febrary decoration that's everything maybe this video has given you some ideas if you want to make your own little Valentine's Day decorations give this video a thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe to my channel if you're not already thank you guys all so much for watching and I will see you all in my next video bye I probably shouldn't even try to explain it because yeah my goodness why can't I talk that we should show you really quickly the pillow cover my already seen it in the vlog but in case you didn't here it is so that's what it looks like it's really pretty just like red flower printhello it's me Gemma and I'm here at the crumbs and doilies shop in Soho and we're getting really excited about Valentine's Day and I'm sure you are as well and if you were wondering what to make your Valentines for Valentine's Day why don't you make little vanilla cupcakes for the secret heart baked inside I'm just about to make some so why don't you follow me in I'll show you how it's done right the first thing I'm gonna do is bake some pink sponge which is gonna be the heart that goes inside the cupcake for that I've started by greasing and flowering two eight-inch tins I'm probably not gonna need all of these but I can't really split this mixture any further so I've got my mixer here and to that I'm gonna add 200 grams of caster sugar and 200 grams of softened unsalted butter and then just whack your paddle in and you want to beat that for a few minutes until it's really pale on white and fluffy right it's gone really pale and fluffy so it's now time to add the eggs as you can see it's completely changed color so I'm going to pop that back on on a medium speed and crack in my three large free-range eggs mixing quite well between each one okay my back is starting to take shape and it's all silky smooth and the eggs all mixed in it's looking really good and now I need to add the flour and I've got 150 grams of plain flour and 50 grams of self-raising flour and I'm going to just sift that straight into the bowl and then I just want to mix that really gently or fold it you can do it by hand but I've got a handy setting online mixer which folds it in really carefully and slowly right that's folded in really gently I don't want to overmix it because I don't want to knock out all the air and then lastly I've got a tablespoon of whole milk and I've put a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract in there mix it really well now I need to make that pink so I've got my food color paste here it's a claret that's the color of it and I will be quite generous with it so I'm going to take a kind of pea-sized blob and mix it really well into that milk so once that's all mixed in you just need to add that to the batter and again fold it really slowly you can do this by hand if you're worried that's almost mixed through I'm just gonna finish that by hand so I'm going to scrape all that batter off the paddle and then give it a really careful but fora mix around scraping the sides and once it's all really thoroughly mixed you need to put an even amount into each tin and then level it with a palette knife once these a nice and level you just need to bake them at 160 degrees C for about 20 minutes or until they're cooked all the way through all right my cakes are out of the oven and I'm gonna leave them to cool and they're gonna come back in about 20 minutes my cake came out the other notes they've cooled down now and I'm just gonna take one of them and using a cake leveler which is this I'm gonna level off the top by taking that crusty bit off the top you can use a serrated knife for this just make sure it's nice and long and make sure you did it really evenly so you can see it's all lovely and pink inside that sponge and I've got our little heart cutter here and I'm just going to cut out 12 hearts from the middle of my cake they're just gonna leave those to do their thing just sittin there and meanwhile we're gonna mix some cupcake batter so I'm gonna just use it a simple vanilla cupcake first of all I'm going to sieve 125 grams of self-raising flour and then add a quarter of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda 125 grams of caster sugar sift that all through and then to that add 125 grams of softened unsalted and then I've got two large free-range eggs I'm going to crack those in and get it mixing I'm starting on a slow speed and then increasing it until it's beating quite well beat it for about one minute it's been beating for about a minute now so I'm just gonna knock it down to the minimum speed and I've got one and a half tablespoons of whole milk in this little jug and I'm gonna add a quarter of a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just stir that around and then I'm gonna pour that in while it's still going and then increase the speed and mix it for about 30 seconds all right I've had about enough of mixing now so I'm just gonna scrape all the batter off my paddle give it a little stir around just to make sure that everything's mixed really well and then using a spoon I like to do scoop an even amount into each case of your cupcake tin here I've got 12 but once you've done that then you to put your secret heart right into the middle of your cupcake so grab your heart and just push it right into the middle of the cake batter all the way down to the bottom but once they're all in we need to pay them but first of all just you probably notice that put them all in the same direction so that's so that you know because once it bakes and once you covered it in icing you're not going to know which around these hearts are so when you cut into it could be any which way so keep them all in the same line and we'll ice them all in the same line and that way you'll know so now we need to bake them at 170 degrees C for 18 to 20 minutes depending on your oven or until they're completely cooked all the way through so my cakes are out of the oven and they're completely cool and meanwhile I made some vanilla buttercream and if you want to learn how to make vanilla buttercream then click on the link now I've put my buttercream into a big piping bag with a nice big fat round nozzle on the end and I'm just going gum with icing them now you'll notice that I've kept all my cakes pointing in the same direction so the hearts are all kind of lined up vertically and that's so that I don't lose track of where the heart is because I'm going to cover them up in a sexy and I've also made some little red sugar paste hearts I just rolled out some sugar paste and cut them using my tiny little heart cutter and I'm going to put two on the top of each cake and that way you're going to know if you cut through the middle of your hearts so there they are little vanilla cupcakes with a hidden surprise inside and all the remains now in the big reveal look at that work perfectly little hidden vanilla a surprise inside this delicious vanilla cupcake one half for you one half for your loved one perhaps or maybe just the whole thing for you if you unlucky on Valentine's Day if you liked this video and you want to see more videos by me then don't forget to subscribe to my channel by

cake so I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to share your creations with me on my Facebook page and I'll see you guys next time happy Valentine's Dayhi this is Tracy from gift-basket appeal and today we're gonna be making these super cute paper holders to hold our little candy treats and this is going to be perfect for Valentine's Day so let's get started the nice thing is is that you'll get to use some of your stash and it doesn't cost a lot to make these I got the little candy treats from Dollar Tree they came in a pack so you can make a bunch of these now this paper pack actually is from Mei Mei made it it's called wedding bliss but it had these hard papers in there that I thought were really cute and this is a six by six paper pad and I think it's just super gorgeous look how pretty this is and so for my treats I can pick just about any of these this is the heart paper that we're going to be using the black and the pink and white it's a double sided paper you can do stripes if you want you can use whatever paper you have and when I was looking through this I was thinking you know what these would be nice little party favors or bridal shower favors or you could even do baby shower paper so you can pick whatever paper you have get that paper out of your stash and start using it so for this I'm going to be using this mini score pal but you don't have to have a score pal to do this these are I cut these six inches of course this is six inches so it's already done for you but right here is two and a quarter but I'll make sure I put the measurements below and I'll put all the material that I use for this project also my little Snickers is the measurement I'm going to use now I do have some Twix bars and so depending on the size of your bar is is what size you're going to cut your paper so I wanted to make sure these would fit and so when I first saw this I was like you know what these are too long and I said you know what I can take some tape because you know how as crafters are we like to it to whatever situation we have and so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take this just a tiny piece of scotch tape I'm gonna tape these ends back so that I can have it measure at around two and a quarter inches so I didn't want those sides to be sticking out but it's up to you and you can make a bunch of these you know for Valentine's Day or for an office party it just depends on what you want to do okay so this of course this is another side that I could use but I'm gonna use the side with the heart so look how pretty that is that's gonna actually fit right in between there so once you've measured that out the width of the candy bar that's how are you gonna do this now with my mini score pal this is actually I have a larger one call the score pal this is the score buddy it's a little mini one I'm going to mark my little paper here and so I need it to be at least an inch this part this way it's an inch so I hope I'm being clear on that this way it's going to be measuring an inch and let me secure that a little bit more with my tape here we should be ready to go okay so I'm going to score this at two and a half turn it this way and score it again at two and a half and you don't need a score buddy to do this okay and so this is the part where our candy bar is gonna sit okay so let me just put this aside and you can do a bunch of these you know I'm gonna go ahead and do this one also so I can use an achievement either side but I think what I'm gonna do is I I love the heart so you just want to make sure you know what parts you want facing out two and a half there and two and a half and this all comes together you'll see and guess what they're super fun to make ok so once that's done once this is done like that I'm going to go ahead and fold this up see how easy that is and fold this up alright so you want your candy bar just sitting in here so it's just kind of like a little chair for your candy bar okay and remember I folded down the ends so they wouldn't stick out just like that and it just sits like this okay so all I'm gonna do now is I've got some double-sided tape and I get this tape from Dollar Tree and I do want I don't want my candy bar to slip out so I'm just taking a little bit of this tape putting it right there putting it right in the middle up here and then I'm folding this up and look how adorable that is now I'm going to punch a hole in there and if you want to punch before you can I just decided I'll punch after I can hold it in place but whatever works for you is fine okay I'm going to punch it up there because I'm gonna need to tie this up okay so let me just go ahead and really get a good fold on that okay make sure when I tape is on there yep and then it makes it just really easy to pull this off okay let's see now and this is my first I've made several DS already just for practice and I was just super happy with the way they came out and if I can do this you can too and so always looking for easy ways to give gifts and I thought this was a super easy one so now I'll do it is just pulling my ribbon through here just get some pretty ribbon you can get red for Valentine's Day or if you're making a specific kind of theme then go for it with whatever colors you want for that thing okay so I'm just kind of giving it a little double knot one way and then I'm gonna nod it the other way okay just like that and so that's what you have already so now you get to just do add a little bit of decoration to this so what I'm gonna do is just use my my little hearts that I already have cut out you'll see how fast this is going and I just want to show you what I use to cut this heart out this is one of my stickers it's really super tiny now what I could have done is just stick it on here but I wanted to use this as a template so now I could either do this which to me it doesn't show up as much but when I flip it over like that I added some stitching to it and everything I can do it like that but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just use this right here because I think that pink looks really cute so you just have fun with it and just try different things so I'm just gonna stick it on with either I could use some double-sided tape you have options I just like to show you different options you can use your art glitter glue if you want I'm gonna just use this right here this is my ad tech crafters tape I'm gonna stick it on there and I could be done but I think it needs a nice little ribbon somewhere off to the side and see I just kind of tilted my I don't have to have it straight I just tilted my heart just a little bit and now this is where you can start using some of your thin ribbon so I'm just gonna make a really quick bow here see just about finish this one this is where you can start to use all your little ribbons up here so you'll do it this way so nothing fancy I'm just making a cute little bow but wouldn't it be nice to leave this on a desk for one of your co-workers or your child can leave this on the desk for a teacher super simple doesn't cost much just get a bag of candy and just go to town start creating because I like to find like really easy and fun stuff and you can get fancier and fancier with these it's just up to you but imagine for a bridal shower get your paper packs your cardstock and stuff and just start making some stuff okay so I'm gonna just cut these down cuz it's Anita a little bit too long yeah so you can have fun making all of this awesome stuff you can put little gems on here pearls imagine for a bridal shower or baby shower just put little pearl things on there if you know in advance that it's a girl or a boy you can do that too okay so now I'm gonna take this add a little bit of glue to this just this tiny dot of glue okay and so some of you have mentioned that you having problems with your glue gun and the strings a tip I learned from another youtuber was that she took the glue gun and when she saw the strings come she just kind of twirled it around and the strings went away because I know those little glue strings could be kind of aggravating so that was a nice tip so now I can just put this on here like that and now I've got a cute little bow look how adorable that is and I can keep adding different things to this I don't have to leave it like that but if you want you can leave it like that or if you if you want here's another idea I have all of these why am i saving all of these hearts get all of your stash out and start doing these little hearts I think this will be nice for a teen party also that's just just me thinking outside the box here now I can take one of these hearts and maybe put one off to the side you use my art glitter glue here so you can make a ton of these and you not just sending them up on the table so that each person can have a little favor to take for coming to the party or whatever a celebration you're having I can also take my gel pen um like I did here on this heart I just took my red gel pen and just went around the sides here so you all you have to do is just measure it just like how I did um if you want to come longer on the top you can I'm thinking I could possibly stack some of these but then you'll have to kind of measure the height to be longer you'll have to use maybe a 12 by 12 paper and kind of cut it down to fit but that would work too so I mean you can stack these so you see how that looks on the inside there I'm thinking stacking some of these candies on top of each other just putting some double-sided tape and stacking them and then you can have kind of a more than one basically so you can do as many as you want so let me show you the other ones that I did look how cute that is aren't those just the most adorable things here's another one just using your scraps of paper to create the hearts and just mix and match them so I hope this helped you I had so much fun making this and I know this was a short video but I just wanted to show you how super easy these were so you go ahead and get your scraps out and don't forget to join us over in our gift basket appeal crafters group on Facebook and I will go ahead and post that link below I'll also post the the link to where you can get one of these many score pals I like this little one it's very convenient for like some of those smaller projects but they do have a larger one also but I'll go ahead and post a link to that as well so I will see you real soon and don't forget to subscribe bye [Music]Hey guys it’s Ro! I thought I would make a quick video because I am making some edible Valentines Day Treats for my friends. And I thought, maybe some of you might need a last minute Valentines Day Gift Idea. I’m basically making cookies with Cookie! She’s been stuck to my side all morning! I don’t really know why, she just always wants to sit with me today. Cookie, do you want to be my valentine, is that what’s going on? Today I’m gonna be taking a traditional Valentines Day Conversation Candy, and giving it a modern twist. I’m gonna be making sugar cookies that look like the candies. I love all the pastel colors. But we’re gonna be writing more modern, popular sayings. Because these conversations, they’re cute, they’re classic! Let’s Kiss, Crazy For You. XOXO, they’re just not as modern as I like, so let’s get started! To start off, you’ll need to make sugar cookie dough, I used the almond sugar cookie recipe from my Nerdy Nummies Cookbook, but you can use whatever recipe you like. The reason I use this one is because it holds shape of cookies very well while it bakes, I love this recipe. I’ll put a link down below to where I’ve made it before. The things you’ll need to make this dough will be: 3 cups of all purpose flour, 1-1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon of sugar, 3/4 cup almond meal, 2 sticks of salted butter at room temperature, 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/8 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 a teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg, 1-1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract. The first thing that you’re gonna do is roll your sugar cookie dough to be about 1/4 of an inch thick, lightly flour the top, so that our cookie cutter doesn’t stick. And now you’re gonna take a heart shaped cookie cutter and we’re gonna cut a bunch of little hearts. I’ve done a lot of baking on this table, I like to hang out here and decorate! Sometimes Mo and I watch movies while I’m decorating little cake pops. It’s so comfy Cookie fell asleep already! She’s like, wake me up when the cookies are done! Remove the excess dough, I’m just balling it over here and then I’m gonna re-roll it and make some more cookies. I’ve got a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper, and you’re gonna transfer all of your cookies over here. And what I really like about this recipe is that they don’t expand too much. They really do hold their shape! This is why its 1 of my favorites. Once you’ve got your cookies on the sheet, what I’m gonna do is pop these cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes, this will help the sugar cookie hold its shape while they’re baking, just a fun tip! After they’re chilled in the freezer you’re gonna pop ‘em into the oven and bake ‘em at 350 for about 12 minutes. You’ll just want to take them out before they start to brown! Cookie, you’ve been so patient that I’m gonna give you a little heart shaped dog treat! Yeah, I found those at the store! Good girl! Once your cookies have baked and had plenty of time to cool, you want to make sure that they’re not hot anymore, because we’re gonna be icing them! If the cookies are still hot, it will melt the icing, you don’t want that! This is the fun part! It’s time to decorate! I like want to have a cookie party right now because look at all these colors! This looks so fun! That would be a fun idea for Valentines Day! You could invite a bunch of friends over and have a cookie decorating party! You can come if you want. I get a lot of questions about what type of icing I use, and this is a royal icing, I made this from scratch, it’s super easy, all you’ll need is 5 egg whites, 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 4 cups of powdered sugar. You just mix it up, and then dye it the colors you want. I used a bunch of different food colorings to make them look like the pastel colors of the conversation hearts, and ta-da! We’ve got the rainbow! Alright, so what you’re gonna do is you’re just gonna take a sugar cookie, and ooh let’s start with purple! Look at this you guys! I’m living, I’m learning, these are little rubber covers that go on top of the tip so that your icing doesn’t dry out! And then here, I just scooped a bunch of my royal icing into a plastic baggie, I put a number 4 tip at the end, for just a little bit more control. You don’t have to do this, you can just use a ziplock baggie and just cut a small little hole at the end. Cookie! You’re supposed to be helping me! These are really easy to ice. The first thing that you’re gonna do to decorate is outline all of your cookies. 1 thing to look out for is if your icing starts to run off the side of the cookie, the icing is just a little bit too thin, so just add a little bit more powdered sugar, to thicken it up! And on the other end of the spectrum, if you’re having a really hard time piping, you can add a little bit of water. You can ice them all the way to the edge, but I like to leave a little bit of room, showing my friends that these are some fresh sugar cookies! Henny, what are you doing over there?!?! After you’ve piped the outline of your heart, we’re gonna let it sit for about 5 minutes to harden, before we fill it in. It’s kind of creating a fence, to hold all of the icing. So I’m gonna sit it off to the side. And, ice some more! I’m gonna be icing my cookies all of the colors that I have up here, except for red, we’re gonna be using red to write on the actual conversations. Alright now we’ve got our cookies all outlined and we’re gonna fill them in with icing! Which, is called flooding, there’s a little bit of baking terminology! Now we’re gonna flood our cookies! Flood them with icing! Which is the yummiest kind of flood. And I do Zig-zags back and forth, bew-bew-bew-bew-beeewwww! And then I like to take a little toothpick, move the icing around, fill it in. Just make sure it all touches! This is why I like to use royal icing on cookies, because you get a very smooth finish once it’s set. And then you’re gonna do this to the rest of your cookies. Now it’s time to use our red royal icing, I’ve made the red royal icing a little bit more thick by adding a little bit more powdered sugar. I do this because when you’re piping on letters, I really want them to be firm and hold their shape. They’re a little bit more detail oriented. Now I’m gonna pipe some popular conversations, I was thinking of some while these were drying. And the first one that came to mind was BAE! Gotta give a cookie to your BAE! Alright, here’s our first 1, it says BAE! Next I’m gonna pipe ILYSM, I Love You So Much! Now I’m gonna pipe the rest of my cookies and come up with some fun conversations. I really like this idea because if you have any inside jokes with your friends, or family members, or a special someone, you can pipe some of those little words on here too! Ta-da! Here are all the Conversation Heart Sugar Cookies that we made today! It was a very fun twist on a traditional Valentines Day Candy! We’ve got: Text Me, Senpai, Relationship Goals, Ship It, Yes Queen, I love you so much, On fleek, or it could be eyebrows on fleek, up to you, up to you! Swipe right, for all my girlfriends using Tinder. Keepers to the right, creepers to the left! My squad, Pizza? BAE, DM Me, and Netflix and Chill, which is probably how I’m gonna be spending my Valentines Day! And, let me know in the comments down below what you would put on a Conversation Heart Cookie, because I’m probably missing some things. I hope you guys enjoyed them, this is a very fun, last minute Valentines Day gift idea, and I hope you have a good Valentines Day, bye-bye!over my head through last Phineas sick so Chris maybe you it doesn't roses so I'm wearing a heart sweater so obviously that means that this is another Valentine's Day themed video because Valentine's Day is coming up so I decided to show you guys a bunch of really cool and easy Valentine's Day treats that you can also turn into really cute Valentine's Day gifts for your friends your family your boyfriend cuz we all know that guys love food then again I like really love food probably more than guys so I'm not ashamed oh and this is my little unicorn she's soaked and I have been bouncing off the walls all day today because I couldn't wait to tell you guys about a really really exciting announcement so I am so excited to tell you guys that I'm actually going to be coming out with a spring clothing line of air pistol which actually launches February 2nd like what February 2nd that's like a week but if you guys want to see some of the clothes that are in the line before even comes out then you guys know to do just tweet hashtag more Moda and if we get enough people to tweet the hashtag then we can unlock some of the looks before the line is out oh and one more thing so the necklace that I'm wearing right now actually says motivator on it and throughout the day if I happen to see it in the mirror or something it just makes me really happy so I've been wearing this non-stop and I thought it'd be really cool if you guys got one too so they can be like our friendship necklaces so we are actually going to be giving out free motivator necklaces with any purchase that you make from my spring clothing line at Aeropostale and they're only available while supplies last you won't be able to buy it it's only gift with purchase so if you guys get anything from the spring line then look forward to getting a motivated necklace and then we can just rock them together and without further ado we're going to go ahead and get into the Valentine's Day treats and gift idea so let's get started so for the macaroons you are going to need three egg whites two cups powdered sugar one cup almond flour 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar so I'm starting off by pouring my powdered sugar in a bowl and mixing that with my almond flour you're going to want to put this in a sifter because you want this mixture to be as thin and powdery as possible next pour your three egg whites into a mixer and keep mixing that until it gets really thick and fluffy then I'm just pouring in my cream of tarter mixing that in and then you're going to slowly add in your sugar now you can add any food coloring that you would like to depending on the color you want of course I'm going with pink now combine your almond flour mixture with your egg white mixture but instead of stirring it you want to kind of fold it together just to get the perfect consistency and once it's kind of dripping off of your spatula it is ready to put in a piping bag and pipe it onto a baking sheet so I'm using this weird thing that kind of looks like a whoopee cushion and I'm just creating little dollops of the batter you can also get these really cool template things to get the perfect macaroon really depends on your preference but before you put it in the oven you want to tap it on the counter to get rid of air bubbles and then wait 30 minutes before putting them in the oven this allows them to kind of harden and get their shape then you can go ahead and put them on in to make a quick filling for the macaroons take 7 tablespoons of butter and mash that up in a bowl then we're just going to whisk two egg yolks and add in 1/4 cup of sugar then add 3 and 1/2 tablespoons of milk I put the mixture in a tiny little saucepan and put it on low heat and kept stirring it until I got kind of a pudding consistency now remember that butter we mashed up earlier well now we're just going to take it and add it to our egg mixture and then take one teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir that in now you can dye your buttercream frosting any color that your heart desires and then just put it in a piping bag and now we are ready to finish our macaroon so I'm just putting a little bit of the buttercream frosting on one of them and then putting another little patty I guess you could call it on top and they look like little hamburgers but they're not for a gift you can put these in a cute little v day box and give them to your friends or your family or you know you could just eat them all I mean that's what I would do yes you read that right Nutella brownies can we just ah you are going to need a teaspoon of vanilla a cup of Nutella half cup of sugar two eggs 1/3 cup butter and 3/4 cup flour start off by mixing your sugar and butter add the eggs your vanilla we cannot forget the Nutella get in my rubber and the last ingredient to add in is the flour now take a greased brownie pan and you're just going to spread your mix into the pan make sure it's evenly distributed and then we're going to pop it in the oven now when you take them out you should have delicious gooey Nutella brownies I'm telling you guys these are amazing you might not want to share but to get into the Valentine's Day spirit I cut mine now in cute little shapes and then I decorated them with sprinkles and frosting so you can definitely get super creative with this part and we're finished they are delicious but one out so this is a great Valentine's Day gift it's kind of a play on words because it's popcorn that says you're poppin get it so you're going to need popcorn some red and pink candy melts and some Valentine's Day M&amp;Ms so I started off with taking this cookie sheet with wax paper and spread out my popcorn and next you just want to melt your colored chocolate once it's melted just take a spoon and drizzle it all over your popcorn I joined the club and as you guys can tell I did the same thing with the red chocolate but you can use any colors that you prefer there's something about hanging out but so it can stick and while the chocolate is still melted you just want to throw on some M&amp;Ms and you're finished so once it is completely hardened you can put it in some little cups or for a gift idea you could put it in a mason jar and then decorate the mason jar with some little duct tape or whatever you can find and then of course you cannot forget that you're poppin gift tag which totally goes with the theme of this and I'm warning guys right now this popcorn is actually addicting it is so good so I definitely think whoever receives this will love it talk nerdy to me don't ever okay I'll stop so this is one of my favorite gift ideas just because it is adorable so you are going to need Valentine's Day nerds some cute glasses gift tags some twine and a sharpie so the steps for this one are pretty self-explanatory you're just going to pick a little vase and fill it up with some nerds and I chose some really cool shaped ones that I got at Michaels and because this is a little play on words I got this little gift tag and I wrote talk nerdy to me on it get it okay maybe not anyway I drew some little glasses and remote controllers just to kind of get in the theme of it and then you just want to tie that on to your little jar and we are finished with that gift idea so this one's really cute because it kind of resembles an arrow you know bow and arrow for Valentine's Day so I found these little popsicle things at Michaels and what I did is I just filled them up with different kinds of candy so whoever you're giving it to you could just fill it up with whatever their favorite candy is I chose some Valentine's Day themed candy of course then I found some sticker glittery fell at a craft store and I just drew out a little triangle cut it out and I put it on the tip of our little cake pop holder then I cut out these small little rectangles and I put those on the bottom of it so that it looks like an arrow and then you can just get really creative you could add ribbon stickers whatever you want to then we have a really yummy and festive Valentine's Day gift to make a red velvet milkshake you're going to need vanilla ice cream milk some vanilla extract and some red velvet cake mix and of course a blender so I'm starting off by putting 1 cup of vanilla ice cream into my blender and then adding half a cup of milk and 3 tablespoons of my red velvet cake mix then pour in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix it up Boober oh and you got to have a milkshake dance doll then just pour it into a glass and you can decorate it with whipped cream sprinkles whatever you prefer this is perfect if you're having a Valentine's Day party or if you're just obsessed with red velvet cake like me and the last one Valentine's Day floats okay so all you really need is some type of soda and some sorbet or anything like that so I found this raspberry sorbet and I put it into a cup then I just poured in some strawberry soda and that's about it these are honestly so good I can't even explain to you guys and I can't believe they're so easy to make you could also use ginger ale or just any carbonated drink and they are adorable and amazing so that's about it for this video hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll talk to you later I I just waved my laptop weirdo at least I think I do oh we got that real this from Baja is one cross only here that's so cool grad this bonus started right now fabulous that is my simple request well thanks for our meal you can have my beanie there you go workhello you guys so today I'm going to show you how to make my strawberry Valentine's Day tart this is so simple to put together it's so stunning it is gorgeous and I'll also be sharing with you my tips on how to make perfect chocolate strawberries your loved one will be amazed by this tart yeah that being said a little get started and let's make this [Music] okay so we're going to make the crust first in my bowl I have some crushed cookies you can use any cookies you prefer guys I love to use Oreos if you are using different cookies though just keep in mind that every cookie absorbs liquids differently so you might need less or more butter and you'll have to adjust anyway you're looking for a wet sand like texture and you're going to transfer this mixture into a greased car pan if you don't have one you can use the pie plates that would also work perfectly distribute your crust evenly press it firmly together using your hands or spoon and you're going to put this in the fridge to set while we make our chocolate covered strawberries you'll need some white chocolate or any chocolate you prefer you're going to pop that into the microwave stirring it every 20-30 seconds do not let it melt completely leave a couple of chunks stir and they will melt as well add a teaspoon of coconut oil you can actually add this at the beginning I just forgot so I'm adding it now this will create a thinner chocolate coating a thinner chocolate shell now I'm going to dye mine white and pink I'm adding white just because I want to light baby pink color but as always guys you do not have to do this I just think that pink and red are so lovely together anyway I'm going to transfer this into another Bowl sometimes you know food coloring can stick to the sides of your bowl and it's good to transfer it that way you don't get streaks of food coloring in your final product now this is pretty self-explanatory however I do want to say two important things make sure your strawberries are completely dry after you've washed them and before dipping them into the chocolate you also want to use cold strawberries that you have just taken out of the fridge and your chocolate should solidify within 15-20 seconds without putting your strawberries into the fridge gently place them onto your parchment paper and let them finish drying this way do not put these into the fridge because what might happen is your chocolate may become a very dull color and you don't want that also if you can use preferably bite size strawberries just because we're making a tart and you're going to be eating you know both the tart and the straw with your fork and it's just easier to eat them if they're small if you can find them guys it's perfectly okay okay so for the nobec filling it's just chocolate ganache like I said many times before it is so versatile and trust me it is so good for this recipe you can add a bit of brandy or any other type of alcohol you like or just keep it simple anyway all I did was mix my hot heavy cream you want the cream to come to a simmer pour it over your chocolate let it stand for about 30 seconds and then you can start you're going to pour this amazing chocolate liquid heaven into your tart pan if you see some smoke cloud it's just because I put my crust into the freezer anyway arrange your strawberries however you like there's no right way to do this it will look beautiful anyway you place your strawberries I'm also going to add some baby strawberries for a bit of contrast and color and size and also taste because they don't have a chocolate coating now cover this with plastic wrap you know just place it gently on top and this will sets just give it about 30 minutes or so but as I said do not refrigerate this chart this is such a gorgeous dessert guys this takes probably half an hour to make from start to finish but it's so beautiful that any one you make the floor will be so impressed the flavor is so delicious if you know me you know I'm not a big fan of chocolate and fruit together I just don't like the combination but this chart guys is just absolutely outstanding make this for your loved one make this for your family for your friends make this for yourself I made those you know for video and I enjoyed it myself with my family so yeah that's how I make my beautiful Valentine's Day tart I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please give it a big thumbs up for me and please subscribe I publish a

be and feed then soon enough so you don't have to make this you know just for that particular day make this any time oh I would love to see your pictures you can send us an Instagram Twitter Facebook all my social media links will be listed in the description box below and yeah be sure to do the hashtag Emma's goodies now it's easy for me to find your recreations and thank you so much for watching and I won't be using [Music]hi this is Tracy from gift-basket appeal and today we're gonna be making these super cute paper holders to hold our little candy treats and this is going to be perfect for Valentine's Day so let's get started the nice thing is is that you'll get to use some of your stash and it doesn't cost a lot to make these I got the little candy treats from Dollar Tree they came in a pack so you can make a bunch of these now this paper pack actually is from Mei Mei made it it's called wedding bliss but it had these hard papers in there that I thought were really cute and this is a six by six paper pad and I think it's just super gorgeous look how pretty this is and so for my treats I can pick just about any of these this is the heart paper that we're going to be using the black and the pink and white it's a double sided paper you can do stripes if you want you can use whatever paper you have and when I was looking through this I was thinking you know what these would be nice little party favors or bridal shower favors or you could even do baby shower paper so you can pick whatever paper you have get that paper out of your stash and start using it so for this I'm going to be using this mini score pal but you don't have to have a score pal to do this these are I cut these six inches of course this is six inches so it's already done for you but right here is two and a quarter but I'll make sure I put the measurements below and I'll put all the material that I use for this project also my little Snickers is the measurement I'm going to use now I do have some Twix bars and so depending on the size of your bar is is what size you're going to cut your paper so I wanted to make sure these would fit and so when I first saw this I was like you know what these are too long and I said you know what I can take some tape because you know how as crafters are we like to it to whatever situation we have and so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take this just a tiny piece of scotch tape I'm gonna tape these ends back so that I can have it measure at around two and a quarter inches so I didn't want those sides to be sticking out but it's up to you and you can make a bunch of these you know for Valentine's Day or for an office party it just depends on what you want to do okay so this of course this is another side that I could use but I'm gonna use the side with the heart so look how pretty that is that's gonna actually fit right in between there so once you've measured that out the width of the candy bar that's how are you gonna do this now with my mini score pal this is actually I have a larger one call the score pal this is the score buddy it's a little mini one I'm going to mark my little paper here and so I need it to be at least an inch this part this way it's an inch so I hope I'm being clear on that this way it's going to be measuring an inch and let me secure that a little bit more with my tape here we should be ready to go okay so I'm going to score this at two and a half turn it this way and score it again at two and a half and you don't need a score buddy to do this okay and so this is the part where our candy bar is gonna sit okay so let me just put this aside and you can do a bunch of these you know I'm gonna go ahead and do this one also so I can use an achievement either side but I think what I'm gonna do is I I love the heart so you just want to make sure you know what parts you want facing out two and a half there and two and a half and this all comes together you'll see and guess what they're super fun to make ok so once that's done once this is done like that I'm going to go ahead and fold this up see how easy that is and fold this up alright so you want your candy bar just sitting in here so it's just kind of like a little chair for your candy bar okay and remember I folded down the ends so they wouldn't stick out just like that and it just sits like this okay so all I'm gonna do now is I've got some double-sided tape and I get this tape from Dollar Tree and I do want I don't want my candy bar to slip out so I'm just taking a little bit of this tape putting it right there putting it right in the middle up here and then I'm folding this up and look how adorable that is now I'm going to punch a hole in there and if you want to punch before you can I just decided I'll punch after I can hold it in place but whatever works for you is fine okay I'm going to punch it up there because I'm gonna need to tie this up okay so let me just go ahead and really get a good fold on that okay make sure when I tape is on there yep and then it makes it just really easy to pull this off okay let's see now and this is my first I've made several DS already just for practice and I was just super happy with the way they came out and if I can do this you can too and so always looking for easy ways to give gifts and I thought this was a super easy one so now I'll do it is just pulling my ribbon through here just get some pretty ribbon you can get red for Valentine's Day or if you're making a specific kind of theme then go for it with whatever colors you want for that thing okay so I'm just kind of giving it a little double knot one way and then I'm gonna nod it the other way okay just like that and so that's what you have already so now you get to just do add a little bit of decoration to this so what I'm gonna do is just use my my little hearts that I already have cut out you'll see how fast this is going and I just want to show you what I use to cut this heart out this is one of my stickers it's really super tiny now what I could have done is just stick it on here but I wanted to use this as a template so now I could either do this which to me it doesn't show up as much but when I flip it over like that I added some stitching to it and everything I can do it like that but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just use this right here because I think that pink looks really cute so you just have fun with it and just try different things so I'm just gonna stick it on with either I could use some double-sided tape you have options I just like to show you different options you can use your art glitter glue if you want I'm gonna just use this right here this is my ad tech crafters tape I'm gonna stick it on there and I could be done but I think it needs a nice little ribbon somewhere off to the side and see I just kind of tilted my I don't have to have it straight I just tilted my heart just a little bit and now this is where you can start using some of your thin ribbon so I'm just gonna make a really quick bow here see just about finish this one this is where you can start to use all your little ribbons up here so you'll do it this way so nothing fancy I'm just making a cute little bow but wouldn't it be nice to leave this on a desk for one of your co-workers or your child can leave this on the desk for a teacher super simple doesn't cost much just get a bag of candy and just go to town start creating because I like to find like really easy and fun stuff and you can get fancier and fancier with these it's just up to you but imagine for a bridal shower get your paper packs your cardstock and stuff and just start making some stuff okay so I'm gonna just cut these down cuz it's Anita a little bit too long yeah so you can have fun making all of this awesome stuff you can put little gems on here pearls imagine for a bridal shower or baby shower just put little pearl things on there if you know in advance that it's a girl or a boy you can do that too okay so now I'm gonna take this add a little bit of glue to this just this tiny dot of glue okay and so some of you have mentioned that you having problems with your glue gun and the strings a tip I learned from another youtuber was that she took the glue gun and when she saw the strings come she just kind of twirled it around and the strings went away because I know those little glue strings could be kind of aggravating so that was a nice tip so now I can just put this on here like that and now I've got a cute little bow look how adorable that is and I can keep adding different things to this I don't have to leave it like that but if you want you can leave it like that or if you if you want here's another idea I have all of these why am i saving all of these hearts get all of your stash out and start doing these little hearts I think this will be nice for a teen party also that's just just me thinking outside the box here now I can take one of these hearts and maybe put one off to the side you use my art glitter glue here so you can make a ton of these and you not just sending them up on the table so that each person can have a little favor to take for coming to the party or whatever a celebration you're having I can also take my gel pen um like I did here on this heart I just took my red gel pen and just went around the sides here so you all you have to do is just measure it just like how I did um if you want to come longer on the top you can I'm thinking I could possibly stack some of these but then you'll have to kind of measure the height to be longer you'll have to use maybe a 12 by 12 paper and kind of cut it down to fit but that would work too so I mean you can stack these so you see how that looks on the inside there I'm thinking stacking some of these candies on top of each other just putting some double-sided tape and stacking them and then you can have kind of a more than one basically so you can do as many as you want so let me show you the other ones that I did look how cute that is aren't those just the most adorable things here's another one just using your scraps of paper to create the hearts and just mix and match them so I hope this helped you I had so much fun making this and I know this was a short video but I just wanted to show you how super easy these were so you go ahead and get your scraps out and don't forget to join us over in our gift basket appeal crafters group on Facebook and I will go ahead and post that link below I'll also post the the link to where you can get one of these many score pals I like this little one it's very convenient for like some of those smaller projects but they do have a larger one also but I'll go ahead and post a link to that as well so I will see you real soon and don't forget to subscribe bye [Music]this is a quick valentine's craft based on my pipe cleaner a hearty toriel i'm going to make this spiral heart with pipe cleaners glue them on the foam paper and a piece of foam tip and maybe decorate first I start with spirals and tooth spirals already made one spiral so I'm going to now make another one and show you how it's done I'm working with two spirals pink and glittering white I make a spiral around the barbecue stick pink is first then the glittery one follows that makes the pink be dominant okay I want more of pink damn that's why I tell you move the excess alright so I squeeze it however I want my heart quite big that's why I can squeeze too much let's see so I kind of like play a little bit I want symmetrical and proportional but not too tight not too small okay so here's one and see okay there's room to squeeze I just squeeze perfect so here I have two pipe cleaner spirals I take another pipe cleaner and I go through my spirals somewhere in the middle I Bend then I push my spirals toward the in the middle I shape a heart and don't worry we'll we'll have time to shape it I twist I dream of Texas and ship again and because the spirals are quite form they allow you to M to shape as a stable shape my heart is ready now I have the my hot glue gun and I want to glue the heart on the piece of foam paper let's cut the heart see with the scissors I cut a nice hard shape now look at the back it's almost the perfect heart okay now the only thing is left is to decorate it kind of believe in less is more so I will only decorate it with this add a little flower now if you have any of this letters you know you can you can stick a letter inside or maybe whole world you just don't have enough letters and then maybe you can also decorate it with beads here I have another heart so please notice this heart I made with again two spirals but this bottle has two regular red pipe cleaners and I squeezed it probably too much that's why my heart is quite small once again I want to glue it on the piece of foam and also maybe I will decorate it with this little bead I don't even know if you can see because it's a tiny red flower with tiny red flower and that's it I can cut out the heart what else do you need to know if you want you can take your piece of foam and before you glue your heart you can pinch a hole in the foam that way you will be able to hang it see there's a hole right there and you're done this is what they look like from behind phantom pretty you can even glue together two of this if you want it's a very cute craft

brownie tray that I've lined with some baking paper a bunt tin and I've got a bowl in a mixer over to the side let's get started the first thing you want to do is we're going to make up your vanilla cake this is my favorite recipe and we're going to do a double batch because we need quite a bit to make our rainbow love hearts so in goes my butter you want to put that in with your sugar and also your oil and vanilla we're going to beat that up until it's really nice and light and fluffy about three or four minutes once you happy that's nice and light and fluffy we're going to add in our eggs I'm going to leave all your measurements for this vanilla cake and separate it into the vanilla cake and the chocolate bundt cake on the my cupcake addiction website and I'll link to that post down below so make sure you check it out everything you need to bake this cake once your eggs or if you just want to give them a quick mix through make sure they're really really well combined again it's great to other sides of my bowl just to make sure that my mix is nice and evenly mixed and then you're going to add in your flour and your milk and we're going to mix it not too long here because we don't want to over develop the glutens in a vanilla cake so you just want to give it a quick mix until you can't see any more loose flour in there and everything's combined started off nice and slow so you don't end up with a massive dust storm beautiful my vanilla cake mixes lovely and thick and delicious and now I'm going to divide it evenly between six bowls it doesn't matter how much batter you have in each Bowl so long as they're all roughly the same once your batter is divided evenly into six bowls you want to color it six different colors and choose your favorites and mix the food coloring through make sure you go for really nice vibrant colors here once all of your colors a mixture you want to put each individual color into a separate snap seal bag you see roughly how much batter I've got so we're going to make a lot of stripy cake right now I'm going to start with my red I'm going to use a pair of scissors to cut off quite a thick chunky tip they're basically acting as piping bags so if you put a stack of piping bags feel free to use those but not many people have six of those laying around so I'm going to start by piping a nice thin line not too thin or you'll be half hours of my first color which for me is going to be red and then I'm moving on to orange cutting off the tip make sure it doesn't go into your cake and I love this particular cake recipe because you can see how kind of thick and chunky it is it holds its shape really well in one color doesn't bleed into the next you just want to keep on lining your vanilla layer cake in all the different colors and you'll notice once you get to the next layer once you finish your first full layer of cake you can actually start lining the exact same color again on top so you kind of end up with like a double thick line the cake batter recipe that I've given you works perfectly for a double batter in this tin and I'll leave dimensions for that down below that is one of the most amazingly vibrant cake batter trays I've ever seen that one's going to go from the oven and it's only going to take between 14 and 16 minutes to bake but you'll know it's done when you press lightly in the center and it springs back and doesn't sink look at this this is my version of heaven I love a good rainbow cake before I took that out I'm just going to take a knife and I just want to run around the outside edges we've got the baking paper on the bottom so I'm not too worried that I'm going to get into too much trouble with sticking I've also learned just a board with another bit of baking paper and I'm going to invert that onto my track making sure not to touch those hot edges and flip it as you lift that off you reveal the most amazing gorgeous vibrant striped rainbow cake this is how we get the rainbow strap technique inside our bunt I'm going to pop this off into the freezer I don't want it to be frozen solid but I want it to be really really nice and cool because that's going to make it a lot firm at a cup for your chocolate bundt I'm gonna take four ounces of my Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate morsels and I'm going to mix them together with a quarter cup of cream and microwave them on 30-second intervals stirring in between it's only gonna take about a minute but what I'm gonna create here is a really delicious semi-sweet chocolate a river with my chocolate syrup done and that's what's gonna make this boat cake super rich and fudgy I'm gonna take all of my cake ingredients now this is a super simple recipe because you really just pop it all together and mix so in goes my sugar my eggs and your egg should be at room temperature for best baking and rise results water also at room temperature I've got a little oil which helps to keep our cake really nice and moist my Nestle Tollhouse cocoa powder because this is going to be a chocolate cake I've got my butter now generally speaking all use salted butter if you don't have salted butter you can also use unsalted butter and just add a pinch of salt to your recipe a little bit of vanilla to really bring out that flavor and a little bit of flour with that baking powder already combined I'm going to mix that through before adding my chocolate syrup I'm you know poor in my next little house semi-sweet chocolate river mixture and this is going to make that color really dark and that flavor really fudgy with our chocolate cake mixture all mixed and ready to go you want to take some nonstick cooking spray and give the bundt in a really good spray don't forget to do the middle bit I always forget to do the middle bit so I'm gonna bake like about a half an inch just a really small amount of chocolate batter on the bottom of my bundt in which is actually gonna be the top of my bundt cake don't put too much here else you're not gonna have enough room for those love hearts to sit on top we're gonna bake this for about seven minutes so that it's par Becht and it gives our little love hearts a nice little flat spot to sit on and use most spatula just to spread it around a little bit and into the oven it goes well that goes baking you can take your cake out of the freezer it doesn't have to be frozen solid but freezing it makes it a lot easier to handle so I'm just going to flip it and that baking paper means it doesn't get stuck to my board peel off the baking paper on top and I'm gonna use a bread knife just to level it off so that all of my hearts are gonna be the same sort of height so just carefully just taking the very very top off this is always my favorite part of any rainbow cake because I just start lifting that take off you reveal the beautiful rainbow cake beneath without any oven browning or any of the edging of cakes it's just stunning now that I've revealed my beautiful cake and leveled it off I'm going to use my love heart cookie cutter and you can actually do this with any shape but I love how it's really nice and easy to balance back in our bunt tin so I'm going to cut love heart shapes as close together as I can and as I do it I'm trying to make sure that I get all of the colors of the rainbow in my love heart so when you're picking your cookie cutter you need to pick one that's going to fit inside your bunt in nicely but that's also going to be able to capture all of those beautiful rainbow colors you're gonna need a lot of these love hearts so keep cutting until you've used up all of your cake you can see how firm that cake is so setting it in the freezer for a little bit really makes it a lot easier to cut and especially if you start to push it out of those get cut as it stops it from crumbling now we want those frozen solid so while our bunt is baking our hearts are freezing and it's time to start thinking about assembly now with my bundt cake nice and kind of baked I'm going to take my raw butter and I'm gonna put a little bit more of that on top it's gonna kind of act like a bit of a glue so I'm just gonna use my spatula and just kind of smear it on its going to melt a little bit because it's raw cake going on to kind of warm hot cake you don't need too much here I'm going to take my little frozen love hearts now so there's a really really nice firm and solid and I'm going to place them upside down all the way around that bundt cake kind of in the middle as much as you can leave a little tiny gap in between each of them because otherwise they're not going to kind of sit in properly in your round shape perfect you've got all of your little love hearts kind of lined up I've got my chocolate cake batter in a large piping bag and this is just so that I can get a really neat fill so I'm going to come in and I'm going to fill between my hearts making sure that I'm giving them each a little bit of personal space this is a beautiful effect because every slice of Funt cake you're going to get rain bowl of hot chocolate rain bowl of hot chocolate so it really makes for a beautiful surprising side effect coming down to the inside and I'm really really squeezing that chocolate cake batter in there because I want to make sure that I don't end up with any gaps or air bubbles inside my cake when I first tried a twice baked cake technique I wasn't 100% sure how cake would go being baked twice in the oven I was absolutely sure that it would come out dry but the moist cake around the outside actually protects it and the fact that we've got a little bit of oil in both of these cake mixes means they're a little bit moist us straight from the get-go I'm going to use my spatula now and I'm just going to just smooth that around but you don't want to overfill your bundt tin be really gentle here we don't want to disturb the points of our love heart I'm going to give my bunt a couple of just soft taps on the bench to make sure that chocolate cake mixtures gone all the way down and that is going off into a moderate oven for about 30 minutes but you'll know it's done when you touch around the outside edges not the middle the outside edges or the inside edges and it springs back when touched so my bundt cake is baked to perfection it looks fantastic but before I take that out I'm going to let it sit in that bunk tin for 15 minutes that's going to allow to sweat a little bit which will help it release really easily when I go to turn it out in the meantime because we can frost this one up warm I'm gonna make a really simple ganache using my Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels I opted for semi-sweet right the way throughout this cake but specifically for the ganache because the cake itself is quite sweet and this is going to take away from that super sweetness of like a milk chocolate feel free to switch it out if you're a milk fan or if you'd like something a little bit darker to make my ganache I'm just going to take my cream and I'm going to pour it over the top of my Nestle Tollhouse chocolate morsels and then that's going to go into the microwave 30-second intervals stirring really well in between it should only take about a minute and we're looking for a beautiful smooth glossy river of chocolate now I'm going to take my buns and I'm going to put it straight into a cake board but to do this I'm going to turn the cake board upside down stick it on top of the tin fill the tin to make sure it's not so hot and then I'm going to flip it I'm going to let the weight of the bundt pull down so that I've kind of not having to do too much to get it out and there's our bundt cake looking rather like an unassuming boring chocolate bun but it's going to be anything but when we cut into it just giving my ganache quick stir around to make sure it's glossy and smooth and silky and I'm going to spoon it on because I want it to kind of gather in little pools around the bottom of my bundt has nothing better than the smell of a rich slightly dark chocolaty ganache I always like to give ganache a couple of taps just to smooth it out a little bit not too hard because I definitely don't want a broken cake stand but essentially this is your surprise inside rainbow love hard bunt this is always the part that makes me the most excited but also the most nervous because you never know what's been going on here until you actually cut it's the moment of truth so when we cut in slicing down the cake feels amazing it's so soft and spongy we did it we made not your Nana's bundt cake I love this guy because it's so unassuming and when you arrive at the party with just another bundt cake and then people cut into it they're going to be amazed at how we got a rainbow-striped love heart baked right inside and beyond excited about how this turned out for me this is the ultimate Valentine's Day cake it says love it says rainbow and it's smothered in chocolate it doesn't really get much better than that bear in mind when you're serving this not every single slice is going to have the exact amount of rainbow because we did have those little gaps of chocolate so with your first slice make sure that you have a beautiful amount of rainbow on both sides of your piece and then cut even sized pieces around the bundt cake which will help you to keep that even rainbow look on all of your pieces throughout a big THANK YOU to Nestle Tollhouse for teaming up with me on today's video I had so much fun coming up with an average bundt cake that's

turn into really cute Valentine's Day gifts for your friends your family your boyfriend cuz we all know that guys love food then again I like really love food probably more than guys so I'm not ashamed oh and this is my little unicorn she's soaked and I have been bouncing off the walls all day today because I couldn't wait to tell you guys about a really really exciting announcement so I am so excited to tell you guys that I'm actually going to be coming out with a spring clothing line of air pistol which actually launches February 2nd like what February 2nd that's like a week but if you guys want to see some of the clothes that are in the line before even comes out then you guys know to do just tweet hashtag more Moda and if we get enough people to tweet the hashtag then we can unlock some of the looks before the line is out oh and one more thing so the necklace that I'm wearing right now actually says motivator on it and throughout the day if I happen to see it in the mirror or something it just makes me really happy so I've been wearing this non-stop and I thought it'd be really cool if you guys got one too so they can be like our friendship necklaces so we are actually going to be giving out free motivator necklaces with any purchase that you make from my spring clothing line at Aeropostale and they're only available while supplies last you won't be able to buy it it's only gift with purchase so if you guys get anything from the spring line then look forward to getting a motivated necklace and then we can just rock them together and without further ado we're going to go ahead and get into the Valentine's Day treats and gift idea so let's get started so for the macaroons you are going to need three egg whites two cups powdered sugar one cup almond flour 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar so I'm starting off by pouring my powdered sugar in a bowl and mixing that with my almond flour you're going to want to put this in a sifter because you want this mixture to be as thin and powdery as possible next pour your three egg whites into a mixer and keep mixing that until it gets really thick and fluffy then I'm just pouring in my cream of tarter mixing that in and then you're going to slowly add in your sugar now you can add any food coloring that you would like to depending on the color you want of course I'm going with pink now combine your almond flour mixture with your egg white mixture but instead of stirring it you want to kind of fold it together just to get the perfect consistency and once it's kind of dripping off of your spatula it is ready to put in a piping bag and pipe it onto a baking sheet so I'm using this weird thing that kind of looks like a whoopee cushion and I'm just creating little dollops of the batter you can also get these really cool template things to get the perfect macaroon really depends on your preference but before you put it in the oven you want to tap it on the counter to get rid of air bubbles and then wait 30 minutes before putting them in the oven this allows them to kind of harden and get their shape then you can go ahead and put them on in to make a quick filling for the macaroons take 7 tablespoons of butter and mash that up in a bowl then we're just going to whisk two egg yolks and add in 1/4 cup of sugar then add 3 and 1/2 tablespoons of milk I put the mixture in a tiny little saucepan and put it on low heat and kept stirring it until I got kind of a pudding consistency now remember that butter we mashed up earlier well now we're just going to take it and add it to our egg mixture and then take one teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir that in now you can dye your buttercream frosting any color that your heart desires and then just put it in a piping bag and now we are ready to finish our macaroon so I'm just putting a little bit of the buttercream frosting on one of them and then putting another little patty I guess you could call it on top and they look like little hamburgers but they're not for a gift you can put these in a cute little v day box and give them to your friends or your family or you know you could just eat them all I mean that's what I would do yes you read that right Nutella brownies can we just ah you are going to need a teaspoon of vanilla a cup of Nutella half cup of sugar two eggs 1/3 cup butter and 3/4 cup flour start off by mixing your sugar and butter add the eggs your vanilla we cannot forget the Nutella get in my rubber and the last ingredient to add in is the flour now take a greased brownie pan and you're just going to spread your mix into the pan make sure it's evenly distributed and then we're going to pop it in the oven now when you take them out you should have delicious gooey Nutella brownies I'm telling you guys these are amazing you might not want to share but to get into the Valentine's Day spirit I cut mine now in cute little shapes and then I decorated them with sprinkles and frosting so you can definitely get super creative with this part and we're finished they are delicious but one out so this is a great Valentine's Day gift it's kind of a play on words because it's popcorn that says you're poppin get it so you're going to need popcorn some red and pink candy melts and some Valentine's Day M&amp;Ms so I started off with taking this cookie sheet with wax paper and spread out my popcorn and next you just want to melt your colored chocolate once it's melted just take a spoon and drizzle it all over your popcorn I joined the club and as you guys can tell I did the same thing with the red chocolate but you can use any colors that you prefer there's something about hanging out but so it can stick and while the chocolate is still melted you just want to throw on some M&amp;Ms and you're finished so once it is completely hardened you can put it in some little cups or for a gift idea you could put it in a mason jar and then decorate the mason jar with some little duct tape or whatever you can find and then of course you cannot forget that you're poppin gift tag which totally goes with the theme of this and I'm warning guys right now this popcorn is actually addicting it is so good so I definitely think whoever receives this will love it talk nerdy to me don't ever okay I'll stop so this is one of my favorite gift ideas just because it is adorable so you are going to need Valentine's Day nerds some cute glasses gift tags some twine and a sharpie so the steps for this one are pretty self-explanatory you're just going to pick a little vase and fill it up with some nerds and I chose some really cool shaped ones that I got at Michaels and because this is a little play on words I got this little gift tag and I wrote talk nerdy to me on it get it okay maybe not anyway I drew some little glasses and remote controllers just to kind of get in the theme of it and then you just want to tie that on to your little jar and we are finished with that gift idea so this one's really cute because it kind of resembles an arrow you know bow and arrow for Valentine's Day so I found these little popsicle things at Michaels and what I did is I just filled them up with different kinds of candy so whoever you're giving it to you could just fill it up with whatever their favorite candy is I chose some Valentine's Day themed candy of course then I found some sticker glittery fell at a craft store and I just drew out a little triangle cut it out and I put it on the tip of our little cake pop holder then I cut out these small little rectangles and I put those on the bottom of it so that it looks like an arrow and then you can just get really creative you could add ribbon stickers whatever you want to then we have a really yummy and festive Valentine's Day gift to make a red velvet milkshake you're going to need vanilla ice cream milk some vanilla extract and some red velvet cake mix and of course a blender so I'm starting off by putting 1 cup of vanilla ice cream into my blender and then adding half a cup of milk and 3 tablespoons of my red velvet cake mix then pour in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix it up Boober oh and you got to have a milkshake dance doll then just pour it into a glass and you can decorate it with whipped cream sprinkles whatever you prefer this is perfect if you're having a Valentine's Day party or if you're just obsessed with red velvet cake like me and the last one Valentine's Day floats okay so all you really need is some type of soda and some sorbet or anything like that so I found this raspberry sorbet and I put it into a cup then I just poured in some strawberry soda and that's about it these are honestly so good I can't even explain to you guys and I can't believe they're so easy to make you could also use ginger ale or just any carbonated drink and they are adorable and amazing so that's about it for this video hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll talk to you later I I just waved my laptop weirdo at least I think I do oh we got that real this from Baja is one cross only here that's so cool grad this bonus started right now fabulous that is my simple request well thanks

Raza comes out I think she's already hop eating it this is what it should look like hi oh I'm so happy I love you you're my best friend[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey yo welcome back in this video I'm gonna show you how to make these really cool candle holders out of items from Hobby Lobby and Walmart I did have a request on Facebook for someone they said that they did not have a Dollar Tree close but they did have Walmart and Michaels in a Hobby Lobby so this is what I came up with I hope you enjoy it the candles on top are just basic candles that I got from the dollar tree and I decorated them with foam hearts if you're gonna do that please do not like them as foam as flammable so use battery powered LED lights if you're going to do that stay tuned and I'll show you how to put them together alrighty so let us get started you're going to need some of these little wooden circle plaques I got these at Hobby Lobby they're the 5 inch ones they were $2.99 and you get them in a 2-pack and all I have done is I have painted them white with some plain white acrylic paint I'll explain these holes here just in a second you're also gonna need some dowel rods I got this pack of eight dowel rods at Walmart they are made of real wood accept no imitations made of real wood you get two of each different diameter and the pack and then I got this pack of a little styrofoam hearts here these came whoa get in the camera dummy this came from Walmart they're like these little hanging styrofoam ornament type deals you get six of them for two dollars and 84 cents they look like that they are so cute you get six for two dollars and 84 cents you're also gonna need some type of glue I suggest wood glue but I can't find my wood glue right now so I'm gonna be using hot glue and I do use gorilla brand glue sticks they are really good for gluing wood together so I'm okay that I don't have actual wood glue I'll just use this if you want to no you don't have to if you trust your your glueing capabilities but for me I drilled a hole and each one of these so if you do that then of course you're gonna need a drill but you will have a drill or you don't want to do that you know - then just glue them down there's not really gonna be a lot of pressure on these you know I mean it was just a candle but anyway I wanted to make mine a little bit more sturdy so I took the dowel rod you know this one was like the quarter inch in diameter dowel rod got a quarter inch drill bit just drilled a hole so that you know this could fit down in there and I'm gonna glue it in as well let's see I think that's all that you need also to trim your dowel rods with of course I use my trusty wire cutters that I use for everything and that is it so basically all that you do is you take a dowel rod and I've already got this one started and you just take your star from hearts and you push them on to the dowel rod so I'm trying to see if I want to do quite red or white and I'm thinking now that I look at it I'm thinking that um it may look better if I do two red and one white so yeah I want to push that up there and a little trick here is because I have made something similar to this before if you've been following my blog for a while I made something similar with other shapes that weren't hearts and as I push them down to the dowel rod it's like the end broke off it cracked and broke off so if you take something I'm just going to use a paintbrush and just go down in the end of it and just kind of pave the way for your dowel rod before you actually press the dowel rod into it it helps a little bit so that of the ends don't go come on you know and and break off and then you know you're sad and you're gonna cry because you know it just didn't work for you but if you do that it helps a little bit so I'm going to slide these to the end and then I just take the heart and then I just slide it onto the dowel rod and you know I don't want to make a video of me you know drilling holes and painting and all that because you know I'm trying to not bore y'all to death so let's just press this and I don't want trying to not put too much pressure see a little bit of it came off but it's okay you can't really see it that looks okay so then I want to take this and I want to put just a little little bit of glue down in this hole here and then I'm going to take the dowel rod just insert that into the hole just like that let's press it down in there hold it for a few seconds this is exciting right watching me glue stuff watching me glue things I just let that sit like that okay I'm sorry for the weird camera angle I'm working on getting some more cameras set up different camera setups here so y'all can see things better and now I'm going to check this in I think that'll be just fine no it's okay maybe I don't so this is what we have went for this glue to get hard before I really go any farther but yeah just like that so I'm looking at this and I'm thinking I need to trim off just a little bit more this whoopsie see like I said I use wire cutters for everything hey they're sharp they work okay so I'm gonna put a little bit of glue into here I'll try to tip this over to the side so you could see it better see and now that is touching the top of that heart there so now I'm just going to well this is what we have so far now I'm just gonna set this up over here and let the glue harden and that's all that you do basically you just run the dowel rod through the center of your hearts you can make it as tall as you want or as short as you want just use one heart if you want to use one or two it doesn't matter run the dowel rod through them glue to your little white centerpiece here and that is what you have so pretty simple although it's not from Dollar Tree you know that someone had had said on Facebook that you know they can't always get to a Dollar Tree but they did have a Walmart close and you know did I have any ideas for any Walmart crafts and you know that's that that's the idea that I had for a Walmart craft so you know I hope it helped you there we are so if you would please give this video a thumbs up click subscribe check me out on other forms of social media I'll put the links to all of those in the description box down below and I hope to see you all next time bye byehi everyone today I'm making Rose cake pops for Valentine's Day make this you'll need 200 grams of chocolate cake and 2 to 3 tablespoons of chocolate buttercream now I just bought my cake from the supermarket just to save some time rumble the cake between your fingers until it resembles crumbs and add the butter cream and mix with a wooden spoon until it comes together in one bump a little bit off and then roll it up into a ball you then try and roll it into a cone shape once you're done place this in the fridge for around 20 minutes well fetch chilling you can make the red buttercream so start by softening 100 grams of unsalted butter to this add 200 grams of icing she'll get in two batches and add a teaspoon of vanilla and give it another mixer then put a small amount of the buttercream in another Bowl and you'll need to dye this green for the leaves under the rose and go ahead and add your red food color need to add quite a lot for this amount of buttercream once the cake is chilled dip your sticks in either candy melts or melted chocolate push the stick right up to the top so it's nice and secure then place these back in the fridge for another 20 minutes then you'll need to fill a piping bag with your red Britta cream lay 104 petal tip and you'll need to position the nozzle and at the wide end is at the bottom ring around the bottom and then another ring around the top then build up the rows by doing sweeping motions open over whilst turning the cake cloth once you finished building up your rows you for tall loops around the bottom this might look a little messy around the bottom but you can tidy this up with your finger now the last thing to do is add the leaves to the bottom and this will also help to cover up any seeds you'll need to fill a piping bag with tip number 67 to make these leaves start at the bottom and apply pressure and slowly release the pressure as you pull up so there you have it how to make a rose cake pop for Valentine's Day you enjoyed this video remember to give it a thumbs up and if you haven't already check out my cheesecake Rose bite tutorial I'm going to share the video and come back soon see you next timejust hey guys so today we are making a bunch of fun recipes that are perfect for Valentine's Day and we are starting off with M&amp;M cookies which are seriously the bomb all you're going to need are some eggs some butter white sugar vanilla extract golden brown sugar or any brown sugar works some flour M&amp;Ms cornstarch and some sprinkles of your choice I use these really awesome little heart ones and they are so cute and we're just going to start off by taking 3/4 a cup of butter and putting it into a large bowl along with 1/2 a cup of white sugar and 3/4 a cup of brown sugar so today I'm using my KitchenAid mixer to make the cookies but you guys can seriously use whatever you can use your hand or a hand mixer anything works and you're just going to cream that together and then we're going to add in one egg and we're also going to add in some vanilla extract I just eyeballed it but about a teaspoon works and then we're just going to blend that again until it becomes nice and creamy and it should look something like this then we're going to add in two cups and two tablespoons of flour to the mixture as well as two teaspoons of cornstarch and then just mix that again until it looks how it looks on the video once our dough has finished mixing like that we're going to add in half a cup of MMS I'm using the Valentine's Day ones because they're so cute and then I'm just folding it in with a spatula and then we're going to transfer that into some saran wrap and then put that in the fridge for at least 30 minutes but it can last up to a couple of days as well so it should look like this then just roll it up and let it sit in the fridge once we're done I just kind of took little pieces of dough and roll it into a ball and put it onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and then I went in with some extra sprinkles and M&amp;Ms and just kind of press them into the top so that when they bake they look extra free so I just did that and then I put it into an oven at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes and they turned out super adorable and seriously some of the best cookies I've ever tasted and they were delicious good our next recipe is for these Oreo pops and they are so cute and delicious if you like Oreos you will love these so you're going to need some lollipop sticks Oreos white chocolate and any sprinkles of your choice so we're just going to start off by taking Oreos out of the packaging you can use as many as you'd like as little as you'd like and you're just going to split them in half it's actually a lot harder to get it perfect than you think but it doesn't actually have to be perfect all you're going to do then is just dip your stick into some melted chocolate and then just put it into the Oreo cream part and then top it with the other side of the cookie super self-explanatory and again it doesn't have to be perfect but once you're done it should look something like this and then let them dry for about 20 minutes and then after that you're just going to dip it into some melted chocolate I used two candy dips because it's a little bit easier to melt but do whatever you like I'm just dipping them in and then dipping them in sprinkles and some I left the plain and just put a little hard on top super customizable do whatever you guys like and that's seriously it and they are so so good all my friends love them these were super big hit and I think that they are adorable if you're throwing a party or something or if you just want a little treat our next recipe is by far my favorite I think it is just the cutest thing ever they are brownie conversation hearts so you'll need candy melts I bought a bunch of different colors as well as some brownie mix I just got it at the store and then to make the brownies you're going to need some vegetable oil and eggs as well as some cookie cutters and some red food gel so we're just going to start off by making the brownies like it says on the back of the box so just put your mix into a bowl add in a couple eggs some vegetable oil and then mix that up also some water don't forget the water and then mix that all up and then just bake it like it says I just put it into a 9 by 13 inch pan and baked it for I think like 20 minutes or so and then I just took the brownies out of the oven and let them cool and then we will continue crazy the way you see me playing when I just want to make once our brownies are out of the oven and completely cool we can just take our heart cookie cutter and cut little hearts out of our big brownie that we made and the best part is that you get to eat the scraps after they are so delicious and once our hearts are all cut out we're just going to put our candy melts into little bowls and melt them all separately and once you're done with that then you can just lay your little hearts out onto a wire rack and then one by one I just did one in each color and I just kind of pour the candy melts on top and then took a little stick and just kind of spread it out all over and let the excess drop off of the wire rack and then let them cool completely so that they were nice and hard once my candy hearts head eventually dried completely I was able to write on top of them with this adorable little red gel that I found and they turned out so cute I just wrote little conversation heart messages on there like kiss me love you call me and all those and I love these so much our next recipe is another conversation heart one this is s'mores conversation heart and they are so cute you're just going to need some graham crackers chocolate marshmallow fluff a heart cookie cutter and some lollipop sticks and we're just going to start off by taking our graham crackers and cutting them into hearts with our little cookie cutter it's actually a lot harder than you think so it just takes a little bit of practice and some patience but you're just going to cut it down and then just kind of gently push it out just be very gentle with it and then we're just going to put on some marshmallow fluff onto one of the hearts it's going to take two hearts for each pop so one's going to have marshmallow and the other is just going to have some chocolate then all you have to do is just put a stick in between and then close them together and let them dry for about ten minutes or so and then once you are ready you can just dip them into the candy melts again you can use whatever colors you'd like I have some really fun and green and blue ones here and then when I was done with that I just wrote on with some red gel again and they turned out so cute I just wrote like really fun little sayings these didn't turn out askew because I don't have the best penmanship but I still love these so much and I love you so our next recipe is another conversation heart one but I love conversation hearts we are making conversation heart popcorn oh my goodness how many times can i say conversation heart but you are going to need some popcorn I'm using kettle corn and just normal white corn some sprinkles of your choice as well as some conversation hearts of course and some white chocolate I'm using the candy dips again and you're just going to start off by taking your popcorn and popping it in the microwave like you normally would and once our popcorn is all popped I'm just going to put it into a large bowl and since I use two different types I'm just going to stir it together so they get all nice and incorporated and then I'm going to put in some white chocolate on top of my popcorn and give it a really nice stir so that everything gets nice and incorporated and every kernel is coated and it's delicious and sweet and salty it's so great and I'm also going to put in my sprinkles at this time I'm using some pink sugar as well as some red sugar and then also some little hearts and I'm just going to sprinkle them all in there stir it around so that it's nice and coated and then I'm going to put it actually onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper to dry for about 15 to 20 minutes so that it gets all nice and delicious then just put it into a serving bowl like so and sprinkle it with some conversation hearts on top and I love the pop of color I just think it's so adorable and it's such a great thing to put on like a party table or just bring to a friend's house seriously anything that's so good and so so so cute our last treat our rice krispies pops I love rice krispies treats I don't know about you but they are so good one of my absolute favorite things and you're going to need some chocolate of your choice some rice krispies marshmallows butter sprinkles and you guessed it lollipop sticks so I'm just going to start off by just making my rice krispies treats like I normally would it actually says the recipe on the box but I'm just taking a half a stick of butter and melting that in a saucepan and then adding in four cups of mini marshmallows and then melting that all together once my marshmallows were all melted I'm just gonna measure out 6 cups of rice krispies cereal into a huge bowl because this gets pretty messy and then once that is all measured up I'm just going to pour in my marshmallows on top of that and give it a really nice long stir once my rice krispies were all mixed together I'm just going to press it into a pan that's lined with some parchment paper so that it doesn't stick and then I'm going to press it down and get it nice and compressed so that I can cut it later and then I'm going to let that cool for about 20 minutes and then as you can see I'm just going to cut them up and then drizzle them with some chocolate after putting a stick on them and some sprinkles on top and that is it I hope you guys enjoyed this video and thank you so much for watching byehello it's me Gemma and I'm here at the crumbs and doilies shop in Soho and we're getting really excited about Valentine's Day and I'm sure you are as well and if you were wondering what to make your Valentines for Valentine's Day why don't you make little vanilla cupcakes for the secret heart baked inside I'm just about to make some so why don't you follow me in I'll show you how it's done right the first thing I'm gonna do is bake some pink sponge which is gonna be the heart that goes inside the cupcake for that I've started by greasing and flowering two eight-inch tins I'm probably not gonna need all of these but I can't really split this mixture any further so I've got my mixer here and to that I'm gonna add 200 grams of caster sugar and 200 grams of softened unsalted butter and then just whack your paddle in and you want to beat that for a few minutes until it's really pale on white and fluffy right it's gone really pale and fluffy so it's now time to add the eggs as you can see it's completely changed color so I'm going to pop that back on on a medium speed and crack in my three large free-range eggs mixing quite well between each one okay my back is starting to take shape and it's all silky smooth and the eggs all mixed in it's looking really good and now I need to add the flour and I've got 150 grams of plain flour and 50 grams of self-raising flour and I'm going to just sift that straight into the bowl and then I just want to mix that really gently or fold it you can do it by hand but I've got a handy setting online mixer which folds it in really carefully and slowly right that's folded in really gently I don't want to overmix it because I don't want to knock out all the air and then lastly I've got a tablespoon of whole milk and I've put a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract in there mix it really well now I need to make that pink so I've got my food color paste here it's a claret that's the color of it and I will be quite generous with it so I'm going to take a kind of pea-sized blob and mix it really well into that milk so once that's all mixed in you just need to add that to the batter and again fold it really slowly you can do this by hand if you're worried that's almost mixed through I'm just gonna finish that by hand so I'm going to scrape all that batter off the paddle and then give it a really careful but fora mix around scraping the sides and once it's all really thoroughly mixed you need to put an even amount into each tin and then level it with a palette knife once these a nice and level you just need to bake them at 160 degrees C for about 20 minutes or until they're cooked all the way through all right my cakes are out of the oven and I'm gonna leave them to cool and they're gonna come back in about 20 minutes my cake came out the other notes they've cooled down now and I'm just gonna take one of them and using a cake leveler which is this I'm gonna level off the top by taking that crusty bit off the top you can use a serrated knife for this just make sure it's nice and long and make sure you did it really evenly so you can see it's all lovely and pink inside that sponge and I've got our little heart cutter here and I'm just going to cut out 12 hearts from the middle of my cake they're just gonna leave those to do their thing just sittin there and meanwhile we're gonna mix some cupcake batter so I'm gonna just use it a simple vanilla cupcake first of all I'm going to sieve 125 grams of self-raising flour and then add a quarter of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda 125 grams of caster sugar sift that all through and then to that add 125 grams of softened unsalted and then I've got two large free-range eggs I'm going to crack those in and get it mixing I'm starting on a slow speed and then increasing it until it's beating quite well beat it for about one minute it's been beating for about a minute now so I'm just gonna knock it down to the minimum speed and I've got one and a half tablespoons of whole milk in this little jug and I'm gonna add a quarter of a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just stir that around and then I'm gonna pour that in while it's still going and then increase the speed and mix it for about 30 seconds all right I've had about enough of mixing now so I'm just gonna scrape all the batter off my paddle give it a little stir around just to make sure that everything's mixed really well and then using a spoon I like to do scoop an even amount into each case of your cupcake tin here I've got 12 but once you've done that then you to put your secret heart right into the middle of your cupcake so grab your heart and just push it right into the middle of the cake batter all the way down to the bottom but once they're all in we need to pay them but first of all just you probably notice that put them all in the same direction so that's so that you know because once it bakes and once you covered it in icing you're not going to know which around these hearts are so when you cut into it could be any which way so keep them all in the same line and we'll ice them all in the same line and that way you'll know so now we need to bake them at 170 degrees C for 18 to 20 minutes depending on your oven or until they're completely cooked all the way through so my cakes are out of the oven and they're completely cool and meanwhile I made some vanilla buttercream and if you want to learn how to make vanilla buttercream then click on the link now I've put my buttercream into a big piping bag with a nice big fat round nozzle on the end and I'm just going gum with icing them now you'll notice that I've kept all my cakes pointing in the same direction so the hearts are all kind of lined up vertically and that's so that I don't lose track of where the heart is because I'm going to cover them up in a sexy and I've also made some little red sugar paste hearts I just rolled out some sugar paste and cut them using my tiny little heart cutter and I'm going to put two on the top of each cake and that way you're going to know if you cut through the middle of your hearts so there they are little vanilla cupcakes with a hidden surprise inside and all the remains now in the big reveal look at that work perfectly little hidden vanilla a surprise inside this delicious vanilla cupcake one half for you one half for your loved one perhaps or maybe just the whole thing for you if you unlucky on Valentine's Day if you liked this

I love you. What do you think you did you like them? So good. Bye Bye ByeHey guys, it’s Ro! Today I’m going to be making DIY Valentines Day treats! I just wanted to share these yummy ideas with you all that I am making this year. You can make them for your friends, your family, or that special someone. Let’s get started! The 1st thing I’m making are these Gummy Pretzel Cupid Arrows, I found the idea online, they’re super easy, no-bake treats! To make these, you will need: Some pretzel sticks, heart shaped gummies, I found these cherry ones at World Market, a pair of baking scissors and some toothpicks. The 1st thing that we’re gonna do is take a heart and poke a hole in the top of the heart with your toothpick. Then you’re gonna take your pretzel stick, place it into the top of the heart of the hole we just made. Now take a second heart, use those baking scissors and you’re gonna cut a triangle at the top of the heart, to make the little tail of the arrow. It’s really sticky, I’m gonna pull that out and, I’m gonna eat it, have a little snack! Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom! Now take your toothpick, make a hole at the bottom, then take your little tail and put it on the other end of the pretzel. It should look a little something like this when it’s all done, and now you’re just gonna make a bunch of them! Pewm, pewm! The next thing that we’re gonna make is a bouquet of chocolate dipped pretzels, this is a fun alternative to flowers, you can give them out at school or work to all of your buddies. The things you’re gonna need are: Some melting chocolates, a glass, a piece of wax paper, and a cookie sheet, some big pretzel sticks, heart shaped sprinkles, I found these at Michaels by Wilton, a roll of ribbon, a piece of scrapbook paper, I’m using red, a pair of scissors, and some tape. The 1st thing that you’re gonna do is take your piece of scrapbook paper, and cut it in half, dig-uh, dig-uh, dig-uh, dig-uh, dig-uh! And then you’re gonna roll it into a cone shape, and secure it at the end with a piece of tape. Now I’m taking my scissors and I’m just touching up the top so that it will look like a cute little smooth vase so that you can stick all these little pretzels in like this, da-dew! Now I’m gonna take my piece of ribbon and my scissors and cut it down the middle because I couldn’t find thin ribbon, so I’m just gonna make my own. With the 1st piece I’m gonna make a little bow, there we go, just like that. I’m taking the 2nd ribbon and I’m putting a little bit of hot glue on the backside, and then I’m placing it around the front to make it look pretty. And I’m just gonna wrap the excess around the back, making a cross. I’m just gonna glue that down and cut off the excess ribbon. Now I’m gonna take the bow, put a little bit of hot glue on the backside, and then stick it on the front of my little bouquet! Hot glue is a little bit messy, it always leaves these little, hot glue, I call it strings, but that’s OK, you can just pull ‘em off! And there you go, your bouquet is all done and now it’s time to make some pretzels! 1st thing you’re gonna do is heat up your chocolate melts, I’m using the microwave. And once they’re all melted you’re gonna pour the chocolate into a tall glass, and then take your big pretzel stick and dip it in the chocolate. I like to pour it on the side and twist it around, that makes it a little bit easier to get the chocolate all up on the stick. ‘Dere we do! ‘Dere we do! Then you’re gonna let the excess chocolate drip off into the cup, and then once a lot of the excess chocolate has dripped off, you’re just gonna place your pretzel stick onto that wax paper. Now take one of your little heart shaped sprinkles, and put a little bit of chocolate on the backside, I’m using a toothpick. And then you’re gonna stick it on top of your pretzel stick, so that when they stick out of the bouquet, they look so Valentine-sy! Look at that little heart, so cute! Then you’re just gonna make a bunch of pretzels and stick ‘em into your bouquet! The last thing that we’re gonna make are these conversation heart cheesecakes! I found them online, they’re so adorable! You’re gonna need all of these ingredients, there’s a bunch of them, so I’ll explain them as we go. The 1st thing that you’re gonna need is a heart shaped mold, I found this from Wilton, and a roasting pan, I’ll put both links down below, so if you’d like to order them online you can. And you’re gonna fill the roasting pan with water, enough so that it will go 1/2 way up the sides of the heart mold. Then pick up the rack with the heart molds on top and set it aside. You’re gonna put the pan with the water in it in the oven while the oven heats up to 325 degrees. While the water is heating up in the oven we are gonna make some cheesecake crust. You’re gonna combine 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 a stick of melted butter, and 1 pinch of cinnamon, and stir them together in a bowl. Now take a tablespoon of crumbs and place them into each of the heart molds, you’re gonna press down on the crumbs to make a compact crust. And once you’ve done that to your molds you’re gonna place this in the fridge while we’re gonna make some cheesecake filling. Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum! To make the cheesecake batter, you’re gonna need 1 cup of sugar, 3 eggs, 2 cups of sour cream, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 blocks of cream cheese and a mixer, you can use a hand mixer if you don’t have a stand mixer, that’s fine. Mix 2 blocks of cream cheese together until they’re very smooth, then you’re gonna add 1 cup of sugar and beat for 1 minute. Then you’re gonna add 3 eggs and beat for another minute, once those are mixed, you’re gonna add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I found these cute heart shaped teaspoon measurers at a store called Sur La Table! I’ll put a link down below so you can check ‘em out! Lastly, add your sour cream and mix it all together 1 last time. Divide the cheesecake batter into 6 bowls, we are gonna dye them the different colors of the traditional conversation hearts. So cute! Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee! The dyes that we’re gonna use are lemon yellow, electric pink, leaf green, electric orange, purple, and we’re gonna be leaving 1 of the bowls blank, just white. Add in a few drops of dye and mix it around until you get the colors you like. Once you’ve got all your colors ready, you’re gonna pour your cheesecake batter into your heart molds, this recipe makes for a double batch, so, we’re just gonna start with 6 and bake another 6 later. When you’re filling the cheesecake into the molds, you can fill it all the way to the top because unlike a regular cake, cheesecake does not rise that much. I’m also just giving these cheesecakes a little jiggle to release all those air bubbles. After your heart molds are filled, place them into the pan with water, which is now filled with hot water, and bake them at 325 for 27 minutes. After they’re done baking, allow them to cool for 1 hour at room temperature, and then place them into the fridge for 3 hours. This will allow them plenty of time to chill and harden, and then you’re gonna take them out of the fridge and just pop them out of the molds. They pop out really easy! I’ve popped them out, they look so cute! And next we’re gonna do some decorating with food coloring dye and a paint brush. Write whatever conversation notes you want on top of the cheesecakes. Just be careful because when these cheesecakes are at room temperature, the surface becomes a little bit soft. These are what mine ended up looking like, but you can write whatever you’d like! Here are all the DIY Valentines Day Treats we made today, they were so fun and easy to make, I hope you guys have a good Valentines Day, and I hope these treats give you some good ideas, because I love them! LOVE THEM! Sorry, I’m weird… OK, bye-bye! Beep-beep-bee-bee-beep-beep-beep!hi guys I just want to make this really quick video just to show you some of the DIY Valentine's Day crafts / decorations that I made I normally don't decorate for Valentine's Day at all or like do anything for Valentine's Day um like to my house or whatever but a week or so ago I just really felt like making stuff and a Valentine's Day was coming up so I decided to make some Valentine's Day stuff and what's really great about all the stuff that I made is that I didn't spend any money at all zero dollars um I used stuff that I already had for everything so yeah I figured I would just show you what I did and maybe if you have the bug to also make something maybe these things will give you some ideas um I got the ideas from Pinterest alright so the first thing that I made is in this little thing hopefully you guys can see this I can't really say too well what I'm doing in the viewfinder because I member in my glasses so if I look like I'm squinting yeah that's why um but I made this little thing this glass jar I had from an olive oil they had olive oil in it so I saved it and cleaned it out and use it and I have bees inside of it you can see that the beads I had from something else everything I had from something else the hearts I cut out of scrapbook paper I just cut out a whole bunch of hearts um some more bigger and some are smaller and you can kind of see what I did there and the back does it look so cute it's just um you can see the other side of the dysgraphic paper and the silver things are pipe cleaners and I just hot glued the hearts to the five layers and I don't know I think it looks really cute I just tied like a little twine thing around the top so yeah that's my first little decoration alright the second thing I made is this this is just a paper heart tree thing I guess the paper hearts are all made out of construction paper I just use pink red and a little bit of white and it's a cone form inside and the code I cut out of scrapbook paper and I just taped it closed and I just hot glued all the hearts all over it um yeah and then I also like strung some so know if you guys can see but there's like bees on there um yeah they're just bees that I had from a really long time ago from like back when I was a kid and I just put them on some string and just like draped it around the tree to kind of make it a little bit prettier but yeah that's the second thing the next thing I made is this coffee filter wreath and this is just made from coffee filters red like red kids paint and cardboard the Bexar as the heart is cardboard you can see it there I will leave a link in the description for how to make this because I tried to explain this like three times already and I keep doing a terrible job so it's not hard to do what's really easy but it's just I can't talk today or something so I'll leave the link in the description if you want to know how to make this basically you just dye the coffee filters and then you stick them through the cardboard like that um I will be honest with you I wouldn't do i wouldn't do this craft again because it's hurt my fingers a lot like this was this took some work cutting out this cutting out the heart was kind of difficult because the cardboard was really thick so that was tricky and then twisting all the coffee filters kind of hurt my fingers too because you just have to keep doing the same thing over and over again it starts to hurt your fingers after a while actually I hadn't like take some breaks in between doing this it took me like two like two and a half days to finish this because my fingers started hurting but I mean I think it looks cute it's definitely one of those things that looks better from like far away if I hold it back here somewhere it looks better from far away up close if you look at it up close you can kind of see like the edge of the cardboard and you can like see through the filters and stuff um but for spending zero dollars on this I think it's pretty cute little Valentine's Day craft then I'm just going to hang this on our front door so yeah there's that the next thing I kind of made or put together is just I can never like hold things around the camera the right way it's just this thing here um this is just a jar like that globalist litter jars that I had made that I talked about in another video I just uh I'll show you I just cut out paper hearts and tape them to the jar can you guys see that am i holding this right in the game room um I just cut out some paper hearts and attach them with some twine to the jar I just think it makes it look kind of Valentine's Day ish and cute and then I just said it on this plate that I already had and on the plate it's just these like feed things that I have from last year I used these to decorate our Valentine's Day tree that I made last year I just put on the plate and put the candle in the middle of it and there you go a Valentine's Day decoration and the last thing that I did I don't even want to say that I made this because it's really not much at all I had this candle sitting on our our TV stand thing but the candle inside is orange and I just thought it looked like Follies like a fall handle so I want to cover up the orange color because it really doesn't go with like the season we're in right now so all I did was just take some old burlap that I had and some lace and just wrapped it around it and hot glued it so there you go now you can't see the orange candle it just looks like a cute little I don't know Febrary decoration that's everything maybe this video has given you some ideas if you want to make your own little Valentine's Day decorations give this video a thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe to my channel if you're not already thank you guys all so much for watching and I will see you all in my next video bye I probably shouldn't even try to explain it because yeah my goodness why can't I talk that we should show you really quickly the pillow cover my already seen it in the vlog but in case you didn't here it is so that's what it looks like it's really pretty just like red flower printhello you guys so today I'm going to show you how to make my strawberry Valentine's Day tart this is so simple to put together it's so stunning it is gorgeous and I'll also be sharing with you my tips on how to make perfect chocolate strawberries your loved one will be amazed by this tart yeah that being said a little get started and let's make this [Music] okay so we're going to make the crust first in my bowl I have some crushed cookies you can use any cookies you prefer guys I love to use Oreos if you are using different cookies though just keep in mind that every cookie absorbs liquids differently so you might need less or more butter and you'll have to adjust anyway you're looking for a wet sand like texture and you're going to transfer this mixture into a greased car pan if you don't have one you can use the pie plates that would also work perfectly distribute your crust evenly press it firmly together using your hands or spoon and you're going to put this in the fridge to set while we make our chocolate covered strawberries you'll need some white chocolate or any chocolate you prefer you're going to pop that into the microwave stirring it every 20-30 seconds do not let it melt completely leave a couple of chunks stir and they will melt as well add a teaspoon of coconut oil you can actually add this at the beginning I just forgot so I'm adding it now this will create a thinner chocolate coating a thinner chocolate shell now I'm going to dye mine white and pink I'm adding white just because I want to light baby pink color but as always guys you do not have to do this I just think that pink and red are so lovely together anyway I'm going to transfer this into another Bowl sometimes you know food coloring can stick to the sides of your bowl and it's good to transfer it that way you don't get streaks of food coloring in your final product now this is pretty self-explanatory however I do want to say two important things make sure your strawberries are completely dry after you've washed them and before dipping them into the chocolate you also want to use cold strawberries that you have just taken out of the fridge and your chocolate should solidify within 15-20 seconds without putting your strawberries into the fridge gently place them onto your parchment paper and let them finish drying this way do not put these into the fridge because what might happen is your chocolate may become a very dull color and you don't want that also if you can use preferably bite size strawberries just because we're making a tart and you're going to be eating you know both the tart and the straw with your fork and it's just easier to eat them if they're small if you can find them guys it's perfectly okay okay so for the nobec filling it's just chocolate ganache like I said many times before it is so versatile and trust me it is so good for this recipe you can add a bit of brandy or any other type of alcohol you like or just keep it simple anyway all I did was mix my hot heavy cream you want the cream to come to a simmer pour it over your chocolate let it stand for about 30 seconds and then you can start you're going to pour this amazing chocolate liquid heaven into your tart pan if you see some smoke cloud it's just because I put my crust into the freezer anyway arrange your strawberries however you like there's no right way to do this it will look beautiful anyway you place your strawberries I'm also going to add some baby strawberries for a bit of contrast and color and size and also taste because they don't have a chocolate coating now cover this with plastic wrap you know just place it gently on top and this will sets just give it about 30 minutes or so but as I said do not refrigerate this chart this is such a gorgeous dessert guys this takes probably half an hour to make from start to finish but it's so beautiful that any one you make the floor will be so impressed the flavor is so delicious if you know me you know I'm not a big fan of chocolate and fruit together I just don't like the combination but this chart guys is just absolutely outstanding make this for your loved one make this for your family for your friends make this for yourself I made those you know for video and I enjoyed it myself with my family so yeah that's how I make my beautiful Valentine's Day tart I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did

start which I'm hoping you will you do not have to make this chart just for Valentine's Day guys make this any time of the year especially now that we're approaching spring we still have some time to go out but you know we're eventually getting there and strawberries will be and feed then soon enough so you don't have to make this you know just for that particular day make this any time oh I would

easy for me to find your recreations and thank you so much for watching and I won't be using [Music]hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I am super excited to team up with Nestle Tollhouse and bring you guys an amazing rainbow love heart surprise inside bundt cake this is perfect Valentine's Day but this is also an amazing cake to share all year round the things that you're going to need I'm using Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels today and I'm also going to use Nestle Tollhouse cocoa powder you'll need some food colorings and make them nice and bright and I've also got some flour I've got butter vanilla a little oil some eggs and I've got some sugar you'll also need some whipping cream and you leave all of your measurements down below as well as conversions depending on where you are and whether using self-raising flour or plain flour all-purpose flour with a little pinch of baking powder I've got a love heart cookie cutter some snacks your bags I've got a serrated bread knife and I'm using quite a large tray a cookie tray or a brownie tray that I've lined with some baking paper a bunt tin and I've got a bowl in a mixer over to the side let's get started the first thing you want to do is we're going to make up your vanilla cake this is my favorite recipe and we're going to do a double batch because we need quite a bit to make our rainbow love hearts so in goes my butter you want to put that in with your sugar and also your oil and vanilla we're going to beat that up until it's really nice and light and fluffy about three or four minutes once you happy that's nice and light and fluffy we're going to add in our eggs I'm going to leave all your measurements for this vanilla cake and separate it into the vanilla cake and the chocolate bundt cake on the my cupcake addiction website and I'll link to that post down below so make sure you check it out everything you need to bake this cake once your eggs or if you just want to give them a quick mix through make sure they're really really well combined again it's great to other sides of my bowl just to make sure that my mix is nice and evenly mixed and then you're going to add in your flour and your milk and we're going to mix it not too long here because we don't want to over develop the glutens in a vanilla cake so you just want to give it a quick mix until you can't see any more loose flour in there and everything's combined started off nice and slow so you don't end up with a massive dust storm beautiful my vanilla cake mixes lovely and thick and delicious and now I'm going to divide it evenly between six bowls it doesn't matter how much batter you have in each Bowl so long as they're all roughly the same once your batter is divided evenly into six bowls you want to color it six different colors and choose your favorites and mix the food coloring through make sure you go for really nice vibrant colors here once all of your colors a mixture you want to put each individual color into a separate snap seal bag you see roughly how much batter I've got so we're going to make a lot of stripy cake right now I'm going to start with my red I'm going to use a pair of scissors to cut off quite a thick chunky tip they're basically acting as piping bags so if you put a stack of piping bags feel free to use those but not many people have six of those laying around so I'm going to start by piping a nice thin line not too thin or you'll be half hours of my first color which for me is going to be red and then I'm moving on to orange cutting off the tip make sure it doesn't go into your cake and I love this particular cake recipe because you can see how kind of thick and chunky it is it holds its shape really well in one color doesn't bleed into the next you just want to keep on lining your vanilla layer cake in all the different colors and you'll notice once you get to the next layer once you finish your first full layer of cake you can actually start lining the exact same color again on top so you kind of end up with like a double thick line the cake batter recipe that I've given you works perfectly for a double batter in this tin and I'll leave dimensions for that down below that is one of the most amazingly vibrant cake batter trays I've ever seen that one's going to go from the oven and it's only going to take between 14 and 16 minutes to bake but you'll know it's done when you press lightly in the center and it springs back and doesn't sink look at this this is my version of heaven I love a good rainbow cake before I took that out I'm just going to take a knife and I just want to run around the outside edges we've got the baking paper on the bottom so I'm not too worried that I'm going to get into too much trouble with sticking I've also learned just a board with another bit of baking paper and I'm going to invert that onto my track making sure not to touch those hot edges and flip it as you lift that off you reveal the most amazing gorgeous vibrant striped rainbow cake this is how we get the rainbow strap technique inside our bunt I'm going to pop this off into the freezer I don't want it to be frozen solid but I want it to be really really nice and cool because that's going to make it a lot firm at a cup for your chocolate bundt I'm gonna take four ounces of my Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate morsels and I'm going to mix them together with a quarter cup of cream and microwave them on 30-second intervals stirring in between it's only gonna take about a minute but what I'm gonna create here is a really delicious semi-sweet chocolate a river with my chocolate syrup done and that's what's gonna make this boat cake super rich and fudgy I'm gonna take all of my cake ingredients now this is a super simple recipe because you really just pop it all together and mix so in goes my sugar my eggs and your egg should be at room temperature for best baking and rise results water also at room temperature I've got a little oil which helps to keep our cake really nice and moist my Nestle Tollhouse cocoa powder because this is going to be a chocolate cake I've got my butter now generally speaking all use salted butter if you don't have salted butter you can also use unsalted butter and just add a pinch of salt to your recipe a little bit of vanilla to really bring out that flavor and a little bit of flour with that baking powder already combined I'm going to mix that through before adding my chocolate syrup I'm you know poor in my next little house semi-sweet chocolate river mixture and this is going to make that color really dark and that flavor really fudgy with our chocolate cake mixture all mixed and ready to go you want to take some nonstick cooking spray and give the bundt in a really good spray don't forget to do the middle bit I always forget to do the middle bit so I'm gonna bake like about a half an inch just a really small amount of chocolate batter on the bottom of my bundt in which is actually gonna be the top of my bundt cake don't put too much here else you're not gonna have enough room for those love hearts to sit on top we're gonna bake this for about seven minutes so that it's par Becht and it gives our little love hearts a nice little flat spot to sit on and use most spatula just to spread it around a little bit and into the oven it goes well that goes baking you can take your cake out of the freezer it doesn't have to be frozen solid but freezing it makes it a lot easier to handle so I'm just going to flip it and that baking paper means it doesn't get stuck to my board peel off the baking paper on top and I'm gonna use a bread knife just to level it off so that all of my hearts are gonna be the same sort of height so just carefully just taking the very very top off this is always my favorite part of any rainbow cake because I just start lifting that take off you reveal the beautiful rainbow cake beneath without any oven browning or any of the edging of cakes it's just stunning now that I've revealed my beautiful cake and leveled it off I'm going to use my love heart cookie cutter and you can actually do this with any shape but I love how it's really nice and easy to balance back in our bunt tin so I'm going to cut love heart shapes as close together as I can and as I do it I'm trying to make sure that I get all of the colors of the rainbow in my love heart so when you're picking your cookie cutter you need to pick one that's going to fit inside your bunt in nicely but that's also going to be able to capture all of those beautiful rainbow colors you're gonna need a lot of these love hearts so keep cutting until you've used up all of your cake you can see how firm that cake is so setting it in the freezer for a little bit really makes it a lot easier to cut and especially if you start to push it out of those get cut as it stops it from crumbling now we want those frozen solid so while our bunt is baking our hearts are freezing and it's time to start thinking about assembly now with my bundt cake nice and kind of baked I'm going to take my raw butter and I'm gonna put a little bit more of that on top it's gonna kind of act like a bit of a glue so I'm just gonna use my spatula and just kind of smear it on its going to melt a little bit because it's raw cake going on to kind of warm hot cake you don't need too much here I'm going to take my little frozen love hearts now so there's a really really nice firm and solid and I'm going to place them upside down all the way around that bundt cake kind of in the middle as much as you can leave a little tiny gap in between each of them because otherwise they're not going to kind of sit in properly in your round shape perfect you've got all of your little love hearts kind of lined up I've got my chocolate cake batter in a large piping bag and this is just so that I can get a really neat fill so I'm going to come in and I'm going to fill between my hearts making sure that I'm giving them each a little bit of personal space this is a beautiful effect because every slice of Funt cake you're going to get rain bowl of hot chocolate rain bowl of hot chocolate so it really makes for a beautiful surprising side effect coming down to the inside and I'm really really squeezing that chocolate cake batter in there because I want to make sure that I don't end up with any gaps or air bubbles inside my cake when I first tried a twice baked cake technique I wasn't 100% sure how cake would go being baked twice in the oven I was absolutely sure that it would come out dry but the moist cake around the outside actually protects it and the fact that we've got a little bit of oil in both of these cake mixes means they're a little bit moist us straight from the get-go I'm going to use my spatula now and I'm just going to just smooth that around but you don't want to overfill your bundt tin be really gentle here we don't want to disturb the points of our love heart I'm going to give my bunt a couple of just soft taps on the bench to make sure that chocolate cake mixtures gone all the way down and that is going off into a moderate oven for about 30 minutes but you'll know it's done when you touch around the outside edges not the middle the outside edges or the inside edges and it springs back when touched so my bundt cake is baked to perfection it looks fantastic but before I take that out I'm going to let it sit in that bunk tin for 15 minutes that's going to allow to sweat a little bit which will help it release really easily when I go to turn it out in the meantime because we can frost this one up warm I'm gonna make a really simple ganache using my Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels I opted for semi-sweet right the way throughout this cake but specifically for the ganache because the cake itself is quite sweet and this is going to take away from that super sweetness of like a milk chocolate feel free to switch it out if you're a milk fan or if you'd like something a little bit darker to make my ganache I'm just going to take my cream and I'm going to pour it over the top of my Nestle Tollhouse chocolate morsels and then that's going to go into the microwave 30-second intervals stirring really well in between it should only take about a minute and we're looking for a beautiful smooth glossy river of chocolate now I'm going to take my buns and I'm going to put it straight into a cake board but to do this I'm going to turn the cake board upside down stick it on top of the tin fill the tin to make sure it's not so hot and then I'm going to flip it I'm going to let the weight of the bundt pull down so that I've kind of not having to do too much to get it out and there's our bundt cake looking rather like an unassuming boring chocolate bun but it's going to be anything but when we cut into it just giving my ganache quick stir around to make sure it's glossy and smooth and silky and I'm going to spoon it on because I want it to kind of gather in little pools around the bottom of my bundt has nothing better than the smell of a rich slightly dark chocolaty ganache I always like to give ganache a couple of taps just to smooth it out a little bit not too hard because I definitely don't want a broken cake stand but essentially this is your surprise inside rainbow love hard bunt this is always the part that makes me the most excited but also the most nervous because you never know what's been going on here until you actually cut it's the moment of truth so when we cut in slicing down the cake feels amazing it's so soft and spongy we did it we made not your Nana's bundt cake I love this guy because it's so unassuming and when you arrive at the party with just another bundt cake and then people cut into it they're going to be amazed at how we got a rainbow-striped love heart baked right inside and beyond excited about how this turned out for me this is the ultimate Valentine's Day cake it says love it says rainbow and it's smothered in chocolate it doesn't really get much better than that bear in mind when you're serving this not every single slice is going to have the exact amount of rainbow because we did have those little gaps of chocolate so with your first slice make sure that you have a beautiful amount of rainbow on both sides of your piece and then cut even sized pieces around the bundt cake which will help you to keep that even rainbow look on all of your pieces throughout a big THANK YOU to Nestle Tollhouse for teaming up with me on today's video I had so much fun coming up with an average bundt cake that's anything other than average using Nestle Tollhouse ingredients if you guys want to see some other really creative exciting ideas for recipes that I've come up with also using their say Toll House ingredients you can click here to check out the Nestle Tollhouse playlist thanks very much for tuning in to my cupcake addiction youhi guys today I'm going to do a Valentine's themed dating video for you all I really loved Valentine's Day I know that some people really have love it or hate it but I just see it as another opportunity to do cute stuff like baking or doing things where I've been single about other when I've been single on Valentine's Day I love to do things like have all of my friends around playing really nice girly sleepover and when I've since I've been with Jim we always try to do something nice but if you stay in and like all the pizza or whether we go do that's a nice and fancy date or go to fit or what is something like that but I always associate Valentine's Day baking I think I bake every single year no matter what I'm doing and I'll just kind of give things to my friends or to Jim what most things are nice thing to do so today I thought I would do some red velvet cake jars so basically what notice I've got these little jars and I bought these from Amazon I will link in the description box where I got to anything from like the string and Lala's actually two things this February from Amazon and but anyway these withdrawals I'm going to do like red velvet cake broken up in there and then some cream cheese like cheesecake mixture then another layer cake fit over there with the cheese sticky stuff and then spring some cake on top and I just think will look really cute and Valentine's E and you can make these with your friends if you were having like a sleepover factor for Valentine's Day or if you're with someone you could make it give it to them I think it'd be really cute little Valentine's gift because we don't like to do that big expensive gifts on Valentine's Day it's nice to just make something for someone works the first thing we need to do is make the red velvet cake I've got my trusty KitchenAid so it's going to be Emma bits because if me such as literally throwing things in and you want to eat your oven I've already got my preheated to 170 degrees Celsius um let's do this so you need a hundred and twenty grams of butter don't where I have watch your hands and use my hands Angele 500 grams of caster sugar I just forgot I do often like to kind of like eat my butter first but try remembers have your buttercream capture as much in business I got that mixing like she was like say like making videos to this question myself okay I'm just gonna walk perhaps amazing that is our butter and sugar cream together I'm not going to add okay I love baking Oh amazing so now you want to get a separate little Bowl and you want to put in it 20 pounds of cocoa powder 1 teaspoon Japanese really cute in a cup a vanilla extract and 40 mils of red food coloring and we're just going to literally combine those three ingredients this is so weird it's like glob jelly oh my goodness - because I've just been writing my baking for a tiny bit for the last like a few months I have just totally run out of adjectives when I was writing it and I had to do all that have like recipe in trays and there's obviously a hundred of them and I had to think of different ways to describe cake and it got to the point where I was like I just have to use a thesaurus for this and there's so many ways you can say that something is nice and sweet and lovely I was having two words like magnificent cupcakes Oh suppose if you don't know I'm doing a baking book and it's very exciting and I'm actually going to the sheet of it after shooting this baking video which is really exciting it's been all of the food shots from done over about three weeks and still got this week and we did a week before I went on my honeymoon and stuff and it's just so fun to be on the shoe like so cool I think I'm going to snap chatting today guys okay so once this is all mixed up it should look like a paste smell we're getting really good at that look she's smart chocolate member and then you just want to add this to your mixture mixing together amazing so now I have 240 mill buttermilk and this is a really important ingredient that you can t miss out red velvet because it gives it up Frank velvet a unique taste I'm going to put in half of this then I'm just going to mix in cozumel then I've got 300 grams of flour and I'm just going to pour in half of that and mix and in the rest of buttermilk make threats the real hour oh we're out a little bit up redness is still going like a moon disastrous and I'm just going to use my spoon to get all of the electrodes with flour from around the edges of the bulb I haven't quite mixed in finally you want to add a teaspoon of salt that's kind of a nice and molten salt and a teaspoon of bicarbonate soda and three teaspoons of white wine vinegar that's another ingredient that's like unique to all of this is oh my god that's nothing really this unique to red velvet cake okay so now all you need to do is divide the mixture equally between three cupcakes or whoever you're going to cook the mixture basically guys we've had a technical disaster and we're not filming for a while so I'm just going to have to fill you in and tell you what happened and luckily you don't miss anything important so basically I have the mixture you saw the whole mixture get completed in the KitchenAid and from there I just popped into two cake tins and make the cakes in the oven for 20 minutes and then I took the cakes out and crumb like broke broken cakes up into pieces like this and I pop them into this bowl that's where our so you haven't missed anything like drastic like actually making anything you just knit missed me putting the cakes in the tins making them in the oven and then taking them out and now that they're cool so they're ready I've broken them all up and I broke them up to a bit cool quicker as well and because this is how we're going to put them jars are broken up um got to level technical disaster okay so now I'm going to make the like creamy cheesecake II kind of icing and I've got 600 grams of icing sugar here and we don't want it to be to either sing like because I think that would be too sickly we need to be more like cheesecake II so I'm using 250 grams of cream cheese but I'm like I'm just going to see how it goes I might use a little bit more I'm not sure so I'm going to put the butter in fasting butter I've got 100 grams of if I try to put it all in at once on my key theater mixer oops it's called 100 grams of butter 600 icing sugar and 250 cream cheese but we'll see how it tastes if it's two sisters whoa why does this always happen to me Oh God right I put a low okay I'm going to put a tea towel around this and almost slightly left icing sugar than planned inside it I can just feel it mixing and come to trust that it's working oh yeah it's mixing up the treats do you think I should wear a suit to the room because I put so much on the table I don't see how we go don't worry until I see looks a bit lumpy because I always find that when I use cream cheese icing that takes a little while is like staring around to get all the lumps out I'm just going to try a little taster of this to see if it's good I think that's really oh definitely is sweet but it's got enough cream cheese in there that it's creamy it doesn't taste like we're just having a mouthful of icing or anything if it's of a clean spoon now not the one that I liked that one is over there to get my cream cheese mixture out and I've got a handful of broken up piece of cake I'm just going to throw these into the water won't even put too many go and I think that's it I'm just going to push them down so look nice like they're filling it oh yeah that's the perfect amount so I guess like the little handfuls what you need to start with it's going to look so cute time to cream cheese and start with just like quite large dollop you know I've made a mess these are going to be trickier than I first oh I was like all of this easy but now I'm just putting them together but making them look in trustworthy is going to be tricky I think ok I'm going to start again but I'm going to just make this one look good off camera in a bit so I'll just set that one aside let's start again I just know put in less cake and let's cream cheese stuff ok so I'm just putting in enough to just kind of cover the bottom this time not too much like that I think should be perfect and with the icing I'm going to try really hard not to hit on the size of the jar so switch to a teaspoon now because the big spoons were just not very practical for getting at these times as your jar so I'm just kind of like spreading it out evenly I think that looks pretty good so I'm just grabbing pieces of cake again I want to make sure I put too much in because we've got to get as she might be nice but overflows a little bit so on the go to town with this cake layer a little warm the other one this cake feels so good guys it feels like I love how dense red velvet cake is so I'm just pushing it down like last times that's really have packed in there okay it was the final layer of cream cheese this one I have to get quite so worried about touching the sides feel like there's a little bit awake rounding off on the top this is really satisfying to do I just have to tell you guys this is great really therapeutic huh give it a nice little like piece on the top which is latrine unnatural and what's the word rustic so like really have that not perfect masterpiece cake smells all that and then the final touch is I'm going to put this down to it I'm just going to sprinkle some cake crumbs I'm so happy with this I think it seriously looks so cute and I love the little prongs on the topping as a pedestal finishing touch but I'm going to add the little strings because I think they do need a bit of decorations so so I'm just going to tie this around do a little bow I'm actually not very good at doing phones this guy's gonna find stuff about me Jim always loves to highlight my shoelaces this is a depart from something yeah how can I get both bits for the bottom I don't know I think that it's really cute now again that is one case jar finished I've now got to do five more or four more and rescue the one that was my first one which is better to laughter but I love this so much I'd be so happy if someone gave me this about Wednesday so a guy sees that on my finished Valentine's cake jars and I think they'd be so cute and I know that they taste amazing because I've been tasting them along the way and if you guys make these at home please tweet me a photo because I would love to see and tweet me a photo of whoever you are enjoying the cake draw with whether it is a boyfriend or husband or some friends and you having a sleepover I'd love to see what you get up to and how you get on making the cake jars oh and don't forget to use the hashtag Tanya bakes and I thought we should just start using it out before the book comes out on June the 30th and I just hope you guys have really happy about sign saying lots of love hiHey guys, it’s Ro! Today I’m going to be making DIY Valentines Day treats! I just wanted to share these yummy ideas with you all that I am making this year. You can make them for your friends, your family, or that special someone. Let’s get started! The 1st thing I’m making are these Gummy Pretzel Cupid Arrows, I found the idea online, they’re super easy, no-bake treats! To make these, you will need: Some pretzel sticks, heart shaped gummies, I found these cherry ones at World Market, a pair of baking scissors and some toothpicks. The 1st thing that we’re gonna do is take a heart and poke a hole in the top of the heart with your toothpick. Then you’re gonna take your pretzel stick, place it into the top of the heart of the hole we just made. Now take a second heart, use those baking scissors and you’re gonna cut a triangle at the top of the heart, to make the little tail of the arrow. It’s really sticky, I’m gonna pull that out and, I’m gonna eat it, have a little snack! Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom! Now take your toothpick, make a hole at the bottom, then take your little tail and put it on the other end of the pretzel. It should look a little something like this when it’s all done, and now you’re just gonna make a bunch of them! Pewm, pewm! The next thing that we’re gonna make is a bouquet of chocolate dipped pretzels, this is a fun alternative to flowers, you can give them out at school or work to all of your buddies. The things you’re gonna need are: Some melting chocolates, a glass, a piece of wax paper, and a cookie sheet, some big pretzel sticks, heart shaped sprinkles, I found these at Michaels by Wilton, a roll of ribbon, a piece of scrapbook paper, I’m using red, a pair of scissors, and some tape. The 1st thing that you’re gonna do is take your piece of scrapbook paper, and cut it in half, dig-uh, dig-uh, dig-uh, dig-uh, dig-uh! And then you’re gonna roll it into a cone shape, and secure it at the end with a piece of tape. Now I’m taking my scissors and I’m just touching up the top so that it will look like a cute little smooth vase so that you can stick all these little pretzels in like this, da-dew! Now I’m gonna take my piece of ribbon and my scissors and cut it down the middle because I couldn’t find thin ribbon, so I’m just gonna make my own. With the 1st piece I’m gonna make a little bow, there we go, just like that. I’m taking the 2nd ribbon and I’m putting a little bit of hot glue on the backside, and then I’m placing it around the front to make it look pretty. And I’m just gonna wrap the excess around the back, making a cross. I’m just gonna glue that down and cut off the excess ribbon. Now I’m gonna take the bow, put a little bit of hot glue on the backside, and then stick it on the front of my little bouquet! Hot glue is a little bit messy, it always leaves these little, hot glue, I call it strings, but that’s OK, you can just pull ‘em off! And there you go, your bouquet is all done and now it’s time to make some pretzels! 1st thing you’re gonna do is heat up your chocolate melts, I’m using the microwave. And once they’re all melted you’re gonna pour the chocolate into a tall glass, and then take your big pretzel stick and dip it in the chocolate. I like to pour it on the side and twist it around, that makes it a little bit easier to get the chocolate all up on the stick. ‘Dere we do! ‘Dere we do! Then you’re gonna let the excess chocolate drip off into the cup, and then once a lot of the excess chocolate has dripped off, you’re just gonna place your pretzel stick onto that wax paper. Now take one of your little heart shaped sprinkles, and put a little bit of chocolate on the backside, I’m using a toothpick. And then you’re gonna stick it on top of your pretzel stick, so that when they stick out of the bouquet, they look so Valentine-sy! Look at that little heart, so cute! Then you’re just gonna make a bunch of pretzels and stick ‘em into your bouquet! The last thing that we’re gonna make are these conversation heart cheesecakes! I found them online, they’re so adorable! You’re gonna need all of these ingredients, there’s a bunch of them, so I’ll explain them as we go. The 1st thing that you’re gonna need is a heart shaped mold, I found this from Wilton, and a roasting pan, I’ll put both links down below, so if you’d like to order them online you can. And you’re gonna fill the roasting pan with water, enough so that it will go 1/2 way up the sides of the heart mold. Then pick up the rack with the heart molds on top and set it aside. You’re gonna put the pan with the water in it in the oven while the oven heats up to 325 degrees. While the water is heating up in the oven we are gonna make some cheesecake crust. You’re gonna combine 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 a stick of melted butter, and 1 pinch of cinnamon, and stir them together in a bowl. Now take a tablespoon of crumbs and place them into each of the heart molds, you’re gonna press down on the crumbs to make a compact crust. And once you’ve done that to your molds you’re gonna place this in the fridge while we’re gonna make some cheesecake filling. Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum! To make the cheesecake batter, you’re gonna need 1 cup of sugar, 3 eggs, 2 cups of sour cream, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 blocks of cream cheese and a mixer, you can use a hand mixer if you don’t have a stand mixer, that’s fine. Mix 2 blocks of cream cheese together until they’re very smooth, then you’re gonna add 1 cup of sugar and beat for 1 minute. Then you’re gonna add 3 eggs and beat for another minute, once those are mixed, you’re gonna add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I found these cute heart shaped teaspoon measurers at a store called Sur La Table! I’ll put a link down below so you can check ‘em out! Lastly, add your sour cream and mix it all together 1 last time. Divide the cheesecake batter into 6 bowls, we are gonna dye them the different colors of the traditional conversation hearts. So cute! Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee! The dyes that we’re gonna use are lemon yellow, electric pink, leaf green, electric orange, purple, and we’re gonna be leaving 1 of the bowls blank, just white. Add in a few drops of dye and mix it around until you get the colors you like. Once you’ve got all your colors ready, you’re gonna pour your cheesecake batter into your heart molds, this recipe makes for a double batch, so, we’re just gonna start with 6 and bake another 6 later. When you’re filling the cheesecake into the molds, you can fill it all the way to the top because unlike a regular cake, cheesecake does not rise that much. I’m also just giving these cheesecakes a little jiggle to release all those air bubbles. After your heart molds are filled, place them into the pan with water, which is now filled with hot water, and bake them at 325 for 27 minutes. After they’re done baking, allow them to cool for 1 hour at room temperature, and then place them into the fridge for 3 hours. This will allow them plenty of time to chill and harden, and then you’re gonna take them out of the fridge and just pop them out of the molds. They pop out really easy! I’ve popped them out, they look so cute! And next we’re gonna do some decorating with food coloring dye and a paint brush. Write whatever conversation notes you want on top of the cheesecakes. Just be careful because when these cheesecakes are at room temperature, the surface becomes a little bit soft. These are what mine ended up looking like, but you can write whatever you’d like! Here are all the DIY Valentines Day Treats we made today, they were so fun and easy to make, I hope you guys have a good Valentines Day, and I hope these treats give you some good ideas, because I love them! LOVE THEM! Sorry, I’m weird… OK, bye-bye! Beep-beep-bee-bee-beep-beep-beep!just hey guys so today we are making a bunch of fun recipes that are perfect for Valentine's Day and we are starting off with M&amp;M cookies which are seriously the bomb all you're going to need are some eggs some butter white sugar vanilla extract golden brown sugar or any brown sugar works some flour M&amp;Ms cornstarch and some sprinkles of your choice I use these really awesome little heart ones and they are so cute and we're just going to start off by taking 3/4 a cup of butter and putting it into a large bowl along with 1/2 a cup of white sugar and 3/4 a cup of brown sugar so today I'm using my KitchenAid mixer to make the cookies but you guys can seriously use whatever you can use your hand or a hand mixer anything works and you're just going to cream that together and then we're going to add in one egg and we're also going to add in some vanilla extract I just eyeballed it but about a teaspoon works and then we're just going to blend that again until it becomes nice and creamy and it should look something like this then we're going to add in two cups and two tablespoons of flour to the mixture as well as two teaspoons of cornstarch and then just mix that again until it looks how it looks on the video once our dough has finished mixing like that we're going to add in half a cup of MMS I'm using the Valentine's Day ones because they're so cute and then I'm just folding it in with a spatula and then we're going to transfer that into some saran wrap and then put that in the fridge for at least 30 minutes but it can last up to a couple of days as well so it should look like this then just roll it up and let it sit in the fridge once we're done I just kind of took little pieces of dough and roll it into a ball and put it onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and then I went in with some extra sprinkles and M&amp;Ms and just kind of press them into the top so that when they bake they look extra free so I just did that and then I put it into an oven at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes and they turned out super adorable and seriously some of the best cookies I've ever tasted and they were delicious good our next recipe is for these Oreo pops and they are so cute and delicious if you like Oreos you will love these so you're going to need some lollipop sticks Oreos white chocolate and any sprinkles of your choice so we're just going to start off by taking Oreos out of the packaging you can use as many as you'd like as little as you'd like and you're just going to split them in half it's actually a lot harder to get it perfect than you think but it doesn't actually have to be perfect all you're going to do then is just dip your stick into some melted chocolate and then just put it into the Oreo cream part and then top it with the other side of the cookie super self-explanatory and again it doesn't have to be perfect but once you're done it should look something like this and then let them dry for about 20 minutes and then after that you're just going to dip it into some melted chocolate I used two candy dips because it's a little bit easier to melt but do whatever you like I'm just dipping them in and then dipping them in sprinkles and some I left the plain and just put a little hard on top super customizable do whatever you guys like and that's seriously it and they are so so good all my friends love them these were super big hit and I think that they are adorable if you're throwing a party or something or if you just want a little treat our next recipe is by far my favorite I think it is just the cutest thing ever they are brownie conversation hearts so you'll need candy melts I bought a bunch of different colors as well as some brownie mix I just got it at the store and then to make the brownies you're going to need some vegetable oil and eggs as well as some cookie cutters and some red food gel so we're just going to start off by making the brownies like it says on the back of the box so just put your mix into a bowl add in a couple eggs some vegetable oil and then mix that up also some water don't forget the water and then mix that all up and then just bake it like it says I just put it into a 9 by 13 inch pan and baked it for I think like 20 minutes or so and then I just took the brownies out of the oven and let them cool and then we will continue crazy the way you see me playing when I just want to make once our brownies are out of the oven and completely cool we can just take our heart cookie cutter and cut little hearts out of our big brownie that we made and the best part is that you get to eat the scraps after they are so delicious and once our hearts are all cut out we're just going to put our candy melts into little bowls and melt them all separately and once you're done with that then you can just lay your little hearts out onto a wire rack and then one by one I just did one in each color and I just kind of pour the candy melts on top and then took a little stick and just kind of spread it out all over and let the excess drop off of the wire rack and then let them cool completely so that they were nice and hard once my candy hearts head eventually dried completely I was able to write on top of them with this adorable little red gel that I found and they turned out so cute I just wrote little conversation heart messages on there like kiss me love you call me and all those and I love these so much our next recipe is another conversation heart one this is s'mores conversation heart and they are so cute you're just going to need some graham crackers chocolate marshmallow fluff a heart cookie cutter and some lollipop sticks and we're just going to start off by taking our graham crackers and cutting them into hearts with our little cookie cutter it's actually a lot harder than you think so it just takes a little bit of practice and some patience but you're just going to cut it down and then just kind of gently push it out just be very gentle with it and then we're just going to put on some marshmallow fluff onto one of the hearts it's going to take two hearts for each pop so one's going to have marshmallow and the other is just going to have some chocolate then all you have to do is just put a stick in between and then close them together and let them dry for about ten minutes or so and then once you are ready you can just dip them into the candy melts again you can use whatever colors you'd like I have some really fun and green and blue ones here and then when I was done with that I just wrote on with some red gel again and they turned out so cute I just wrote like really fun little sayings these didn't turn out askew because I don't have the best penmanship but I still love these so much and I love you so our next recipe is another conversation heart one but I love conversation hearts we are making conversation heart popcorn oh my goodness how many times can i say conversation heart but you are going to need some popcorn I'm using kettle corn and just normal white corn some sprinkles of your choice as well as some conversation hearts of course and some white chocolate I'm using the candy dips again and you're just going to start off by taking your popcorn and popping it in the microwave like you normally would and once our popcorn is all popped I'm just going to put it into a large bowl and since I use two different types I'm just going to stir it together so they get all nice and incorporated and then I'm going to put in some white chocolate on top of my popcorn and give it a really nice stir so that everything gets nice and incorporated and every kernel is coated and it's delicious and sweet and salty it's so great and I'm also going to put in my sprinkles at this time I'm using some pink sugar as well as some red sugar and then also some little hearts and I'm just going to sprinkle them all in there stir it around so that it's nice and coated and then I'm going to put it actually onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper to dry for about 15 to 20 minutes so that it gets all nice and delicious then just put it into a serving bowl like so and sprinkle it with some conversation hearts on top and I love the pop of color I just think it's so adorable and it's such a great thing to put on like a party table or just bring to a friend's house seriously anything that's so good and so so so cute our last treat our rice krispies pops I love rice krispies treats I don't know about you but they are so good one of my absolute favorite things and you're going to need some chocolate of your choice some rice krispies marshmallows butter sprinkles and you guessed it lollipop sticks so I'm just going to start off by just making my rice krispies treats like I normally would it actually says the recipe on the box but I'm just taking a half a stick of butter and melting that in a saucepan and then adding in four cups of mini marshmallows and then melting that all together once my marshmallows were all melted I'm just gonna measure out 6 cups of rice krispies cereal into a huge bowl because this gets pretty messy and then once that is all measured up I'm just going to pour in my marshmallows on top of that and give it a really nice long stir once my rice krispies were all mixed together I'm just going to press it into a pan that's lined with some parchment paper so that it doesn't stick and then I'm going to press it down and get it nice and compressed so that I can cut it later and then I'm going to let that cool for about 20 minutes and then as you can see I'm just going to cut them up and then drizzle them with some chocolate after putting a stick on them and some sprinkles on top and that is it I hope you

I didn't understand how limited I was back then. I didn't know any better. I literally could not walk from my front door to the end of my driveway. That's how bad it was. I lost over 300 pounds, but when I first started my journey with Ideal Protein, I just did not want to do it. Now I look back and I wish I would have started it six months sooner. (laughs) I couldn't enjoy life at 684 pounds. I was living, but I wasn't alive. Now, I'm living and I'm enjoying life. And I'm making the most of it. I want to make up for all the years I've missed. And I want to be able to enjoy my life again. And I can do that because of Ideal Protein.

I thought I would make a quick video because I am making some edible Valentines Day Treats for my friends. And I thought, maybe some of you might need a last minute Valentines Day Gift Idea. I’m basically making cookies with Cookie! She’s been stuck to my side all morning! I don’t really know why, she just always wants to sit with me today. Cookie, do you want to be my valentine, is that what’s going on? Today I’m gonna be taking a traditional Valentines Day Conversation Candy, and giving it a modern twist. I’m gonna be making sugar cookies that look like the candies. I love all the pastel colors. But we’re gonna be writing more modern, popular sayings. Because these conversations, they’re cute, they’re classic! Let’s Kiss, Crazy For You. XOXO, they’re just not as modern as I like, so let’s get started! To start off, you’ll need to make sugar cookie dough, I used the almond sugar cookie recipe from my Nerdy Nummies Cookbook, but you can use whatever recipe you like. The reason I use this one is because it holds shape of cookies very well while it bakes, I love this recipe. I’ll put a link down below to where I’ve made it before. The things you’ll need to make this dough will be: 3 cups of all purpose flour, 1-1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon of sugar, 3/4 cup almond meal, 2 sticks of salted butter at room temperature, 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/8 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 a teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg, 1-1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract. The first thing that you’re gonna do is roll your sugar cookie dough to be about 1/4 of an inch thick, lightly flour the top, so that our cookie cutter doesn’t stick. And now you’re gonna take a heart shaped cookie cutter and we’re gonna cut a bunch of little hearts. I’ve done a lot of baking on this table, I like to hang out here and decorate! Sometimes Mo and I watch movies while I’m decorating little cake pops. It’s so comfy Cookie fell asleep already! She’s like, wake me up when the cookies are done! Remove the excess dough, I’m just balling it over here and then I’m gonna re-roll it and make some more cookies. I’ve got a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper, and you’re gonna transfer all of your cookies over here. And what I really like about this recipe is that they don’t expand too much. They really do hold their shape! This is why its 1 of my favorites. Once you’ve got your cookies on the sheet, what I’m gonna do is pop these cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes, this will help the sugar cookie hold its shape while they’re baking, just a fun tip! After they’re chilled in the freezer you’re gonna pop ‘em into the oven and bake ‘em at 350 for about 12 minutes. You’ll just want to take them out before they start to brown! Cookie, you’ve been so patient that I’m gonna give you a little heart shaped dog treat! Yeah, I found those at the store! Good girl! Once your cookies have baked and had plenty of time to cool, you want to make sure that they’re not hot anymore, because we’re gonna be icing them! If the cookies are still hot, it will melt the icing, you don’t want that! This is the fun part! It’s time to decorate! I like want to have a cookie party right now because look at all these colors! This looks so fun! That would be a fun idea for Valentines Day! You could invite a bunch of friends over and have a cookie decorating party! You can come if you want. I get a lot of questions about what type of icing I use, and this is a royal icing, I made this from scratch, it’s super easy, all you’ll need is 5 egg whites, 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 4 cups of powdered sugar. You just mix it up, and then dye it the colors you want. I used a bunch of different food colorings to make them look like the pastel colors of the conversation hearts, and ta-da! We’ve got the rainbow! Alright, so what you’re gonna do is you’re just gonna take a sugar cookie, and ooh let’s start with purple! Look at this you guys! I’m living, I’m learning, these are little rubber covers that go on top of the tip so that your icing doesn’t dry out! And then here, I just scooped a bunch of my royal icing into a plastic baggie, I put a number 4 tip at the end, for just a little bit more control. You don’t have to do this, you can just use a ziplock baggie and just cut a small little hole at the end. Cookie! You’re supposed to be helping me! These are really easy to ice. The first thing that you’re gonna do to decorate is outline all of your cookies. 1 thing to look out for is if your icing starts to run off the side of the cookie, the icing is just a little bit too thin, so just add a little bit more powdered sugar, to thicken it up! And on the other end of the spectrum, if you’re having a really hard time piping, you can add a little bit of water. You can ice them all the way to the edge, but I like to leave a little bit of room, showing my friends that these are some fresh sugar cookies! Henny, what are you doing over there?!?! After you’ve piped the outline of your heart, we’re gonna let it sit for about 5 minutes to harden, before we fill it in. It’s kind of creating a fence, to hold all of the icing. So I’m gonna sit it off to the side. And, ice some more! I’m gonna be icing my cookies all of the colors that I have up here, except for red, we’re gonna be using red to write on the actual conversations. Alright now we’ve got our cookies all outlined and we’re gonna fill them in with icing! Which, is called flooding, there’s a little bit of baking terminology! Now we’re gonna flood our cookies! Flood them with icing! Which is the yummiest kind of flood. And I do Zig-zags back and forth, bew-bew-bew-bew-beeewwww! And then I like to take a little toothpick, move the icing around, fill it in. Just make sure it all touches! This is why I like to use royal icing on cookies, because you get a very smooth finish once it’s set. And then you’re gonna do this to the rest of your cookies. Now it’s time to use our red royal icing, I’ve made the red royal icing a little bit more thick by adding a little bit more powdered sugar. I do this because when you’re piping on letters, I really want them to be firm and hold their shape. They’re a little bit more detail oriented. Now I’m gonna pipe some popular conversations, I was thinking of some while these were drying. And the first one that came to mind was BAE! Gotta give a cookie to your BAE! Alright, here’s our first 1, it says BAE! Next I’m gonna pipe ILYSM, I Love You So Much! Now I’m gonna pipe the rest of my cookies and come up with some fun conversations. I really like this idea because if you have any inside jokes with your friends, or family members, or a special someone, you can pipe some of those little words on here too! Ta-da! Here are all the Conversation Heart Sugar Cookies that we made today! It was a very fun twist on a traditional Valentines Day Candy! We’ve got: Text Me, Senpai, Relationship Goals, Ship It, Yes Queen, I love you so much, On fleek, or it could be eyebrows on fleek, up to you, up to you! Swipe right, for all my girlfriends using Tinder. Keepers to the right, creepers to the left! My squad, Pizza? BAE, DM Me, and Netflix and Chill, which is probably how I’m gonna be spending my Valentines Day! And, let me know in the comments down below what you would put on a Conversation Heart Cookie, because I’m probably missing some things. I hope you guys enjoyed them, this is a very fun, last minute Valentines Day gift idea, and I hope you have a good Valentines Day, bye-bye!♪ (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ DOLORES ABERNATHY: Look at this world.

(lively music) Okay guys, Valentine's Day is approaching and one of the most popular candies during Valentine's Day is these Conversation Hearts. Like they say, oh, a bunch of different messages on them. Dream big. Crazy for you. Like and subscribe. Give me a hug. Anyway, they're cool because they have cute little messages on them. Let's start making our giant Conversation Heart using this pan and these ingredients. This is what you're going to need, two sticks of butter, going to use my trusty spatula. There we go. 3/4 cup of white sugar. 3/4 cup of brown sugar. Now we're going to beat it 'til it's nice and fluffy, like a cloud. All right, it's nice and fluffy. Now we are going to add one teaspoon of vanilla. This is the stuff that makes it smell really good. Ah! Now we are going to add two eggs. Make sure you're not mixing so that if you accidentally drop a shell in there, it won't get lost in the dough. And mix it up some more. (lively music) All the stuff that we just put in here are considered wet ingredients. Now we're going to move on to the dry ingredients. Right here we have two and 1/4 cup of flour. We're going to add in one teaspoon of baking soda and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. And we're going to mix our dry ingredients together. Now we are going to slowly pour our dry ingredients in our wet ingredients. If you add the ingredients slowly, it will mix together really good. Now for my favorite part, the chocolate chips. I'm using milk chocolate. Comment down below which one you like better, milk chocolate or dark chocolate. Milk chocolate all the way. Now we are going to put the dough in the pan. It doesn't have to be really thick, 'cause it's going to get bigger in the oven. Oh yeah, FYI, I already sprayed my pan. That way it won't stick. All right, into the oven we go, 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Check it out! Oh, this looks so good. Okay, guys, here we go. I'm going to flip it. Sweet, this is the biggest chocolate chip cookie I've ever seen. Whoa! Time to frost it. I'm going to use pink frosting. Guys, after we're done frosting this, we're going to write some words on it. What should be on our giant Conversation Heart? Comment down below. I heart you, you melt my heart, love bug, cutie pie, XOXO? There we go. All right, now we are going to use our white frosting and pipe some words on there. Hmm, what do you think we should put? (lively music) I heart you tube. (twinkling flourish) We made a second heart shaped cookie. I'm going to make this one purple. Oh wow, this looks delicious. Now let's pipe some words on there. What should we say this time? What about BFF? (lively music) These look like cute little flowers. Guys, look how cute this is. Best friends forever. I heart YouTube, boom boom, boom boom. Guys, I made some mini chocolate chip versions, using these cookie cutters. I made a big huge cookie and then used the cookie cutters to cut them out. This one says cutie pie, 'cause you're a cutie pie. Call me baby. I heart you. And this one says sweet pea. Time for a taste test. So as you can see, there's chocolate chip cookies underneath and frosting on the top. Oh that's so good. (applauding) Hits the stop.

grain finish and we're gonna cut our cookies try to get as many as you can on their and we're gonna freeze them my cookies have been in the freezer they're nice and firm here's a chocolate one all I'm doing is I'm cutting the center part I'm keeping the center part I want to bake these and I'm replacing it with vanilla cookie gently put it in those are gonna bake together and i'm taking my little tiny pink hearts that I made earlier and I'm placing those in this opening here and then I'm gonna bake these and there's the cookie I hope you enjoyed the video and that you'll give these cookies a try they're really easy I know sometimes people say it's easy and it's not easy this is really easy and no matter who your making them for I'm sure they're going to love them I'll have the recipes under this video as well as all the supplies that I use closing musicopening music I've got some royal icing here that I've added a little bit of gold color to and I diluted it and now I'm covering my surface of my cookie in this royal icing very thin amount it is just to give a nice finish to the cookies surface it will be exposed from the decoration im gonna be cutting a hole in the fondant gonna start by adding the wood element to the cookie here's the cookie ready with a layer of royal icing dry on there and now I'm rolling out some marbled brown fondant and I marbled for another project and if you want to see that video I show how to marble the fondant you can look in the links below alright now I've got this textured mat a nice wood grain position your fondant where you'd like it to get if you want some knots such on your fondant there we go now we're gonna peal that off now I have two crutters the cutter that was the size of the cookie which is this one here im cutting remove your excess and now I have the center cutter place that in the middle cut your hole but leave the fondant there that will help maintain this shape of the fondant or else it will warp if you pick up just a the outer perimeter like that it'll all get weird and misshapen just leave it upside down like that now we're going to take our cookie and we're gonna put it upside down on the fondant position yourself look on the other side make sure its centred press on the edges where it's gotta be glued so that it adheres onto the cookie and then you can flip it now here you can gently push it to the edge fondant has elasticity we're not using this and then you can just rub it on and it doesn't matter if the the inner heart is a little bit warped we want this to look like you know when you see those hearts dug out of a tree that's what we wanna look we want to look so it doesn't have to be perfect the next step here I created a a heart around the heart in kinda branches added a little bit of sprinkles to look like baby's breath and then some fondant flowers here are my flowes I made in in advance using seven for each cookie hear I've got some brown royal icing in a three tip and now I'm creating a jagged heart I want it to look like branches don't use royal icing thats too stiff or it'll pop off your fondant it won't stick now im gonna put this in my bead tray and I'm just going to sprinkle it with the sprinkles here while it's wet so they stick I just wanna add a bit of detail to it its quite brown but its a less girly version of a Valentine cookie alright now that that is done and the royal icing is still wet we're gonna add our little flowers we're pressing them into the wet royal icing we wanna do this while the royal icing is wet so that it squishes and not breaks the pink is a necessary there for the design design or else it's not very pretty you can make the flowers any color you want just something to brighten it up yellow would be nice as well i don't know if you can see here the remnants of my work but I didn't like how it lined up and so with a brush i kind of rubbed off the royal icing and I'm gonna start again I wanted a question mark and so I think it works better if you work from the bottom backwards you write your message backwards and here is the question mark and then mine and then you here and then the wood and this way I can fit in as opposed to this one I have the question mark now for the last element of this cookie the leaves I have electric green here and you can do a leaf tip where the leaf is a little bit kind of up but you will inevitably get breakage and so I'm opting for a runnier icing and im piping a dot that I'm pulling and it'll make a more kinda sturdy design should you perhaps be shipping this or bagging them and this is a two tip at the flower im just doing a dot and pulling and thats it add as many as you like rotate your cookie to facilitate doing it try to get them to rest on the cookie like I say if you want to avoid breakage you could certainly make these leaves out of fondant but it is more time consuming than working in royal icing often these little kinds of touches if you do them in royal icing it doesn't really affect the taste if you don't like royal icing but you really can crank them out much quicker and here is the finished cookie a little kind of shabby chic country look closing musictoday's theme is tattoo inspired this cookie I made a while back and I've had many requests as to how I did it so today's tutorial I'm going to show you how incredibly easy this design was to make in the approximate center of this cookie we're going to paint some icing get a base coat here's my template which you will find on my blog okay now what I did is I cut out the center and we're going to be using this to create the shading we're gonna start by first creating the keyhole on the cookie and we're just doing that with a marker now we're going to be outlining this cookie about you know half a centimeter from the edge in red and so we're gonna find the center which is about here and we're gonna do a circle in black you can go about like here and there's our keyhole and that's it if you have trouble getting really dark colours you might want to try this product it is the rainbow dust food gel and they're the ones that two ended marker you know with the two size tips I added you know a small squirt and look at how deep the colour is this is the claret and so yeah you might want to give this a shot for red and black so you don't have to add too too much all right next step of the project were outlining about 3/8 of an inch or half a centimeter from the edge in your center colour you don't have to make it in red whatever colour you want ok now I'm outlining the key hole and I'm flooding right away and so by colouring on the keyhole I didn't have to mix in mix up a black batch of icing and I created my outline I just brushed on the white coloured it in let's do the other side now we're gonna wait for this to dry say about an hour just so we can handle it safely without damaging the surface I'm really liking this colour and a shake to get the ripples out and we're gonna let that dry we're going to start by shading the red area before alright I've got black in here and I'm hitting right on the stencil here don't pull up too high your gonna get your cookie all black here we go and now when we lift this off we have the line to pipe on the templates going to be on my blog and the link to the air brush that I use is under this video now we're going to be working on the outer perimeter of the cookie and when you're doing gold it's important to have some base colour before you do your luster dust if you just add gold luster dust to white icing you're not going to get a very deep gold colour so you better to add some gold or yellow to your royal icing just to get a base color some background so that when you apply your luster dust it's it's not too flat by airbrushing with that stencil you see we created a line to follow and so now oh I hit there we're gonna outline the cookie with gold and a 1.5 tip the line is very easy to see hit right on there we go this cookie is really not complicated so and now the whole outer perimeter of the cookie and then we're gonna flood the gold area there's the flooded cookie we're just gonna flood the yellow area or gold area I should say if you have several of these to make you could very well stop right here it's going to be very nice once it's painted gold keep it simple but if you want to you can add a few lines to the gold to make it look a little bit more like an authentic locket here is the gold you just painted on I'm running low so I'm gonna mix up a little bit more I've got a wide flat brush and you can just go quickly on the areas that aren't really close to your other colour and then you can come back in with a smaller brush for the detail here here are the cookies and you can see here with the little bit of added detail and this one does not have it but it's all about time and how much time you have to put on the design the people who look at it will not know that this was an option they only see this and they're gonna think it's perfect so it's up to you if you feel you wanna go that extra little bit Thanks for watching and see you next time!opening music I've got

Valentine's Day is coming up and I wanted to make some themed recipes. Today, we're gonna be making three Valentine's Day breakfast ideas. I really love these ideas not only for Valentine's Day, but because they're all heart-shaped. You can also make these for Father's Day, or Mother's Day. Or, if you have an anniversary with "bae." Or, just because! If you wanted to make something sweet, or do something kind for a sibling. I don't know! Also, if you aren't that into breakfast, you just don't like to eat a big meal early on in the day, you can always have breakfast for dinner. I've done that! Alright, let's get started. The first recipe that we're gonna be making are these homemade heart pancakes. The things you'll need to make these homemade heart pancakes will be: 1½ cups of milk, 1½ cups of all-purpose flour, 1 egg, 3 tablespoons of butter, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, a large heart cookie cutter, and a small heart cookie cutter. The first step to making our pancakes is making our pancake batter. In a medium-sized bowl, we're gonna whisk together our dry ingredients: Our flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Then, whisk together until well-combined. Our dry ingredients are ready, and now we're gonna add our wet ingredients: Our milk, our butter―I've melted it in the microwave, vanilla extract, and our egg. Remember, you want to add the whole egg. Then again, whisk together until well-combined. Our batter is ready, and now we're gonna take it, a non-stick frying pan, a little bit of butter, 1/4 measuring cup, some tongs, a spatula, and a heart-shaped cookie cutter over to the stove! Turn heat to medium-low and grease your pan -- I'm using some butter. Once the butter is completely melted, Put the greased cookie cutter into the centre of the pan. Pour 1/4 scoop of batter into the cookie cutter and spread it evenly around. Cook until little bubbles begin to rise to the top. This usually takes about 1 minute. Then, gently remove the cookie cutter -- I'm using some tongs -- and flip your pancake over with the spatula. Cook until golden-brown, which usually takes about another minute. Then remove from the pan. Make as many pancakes as you want! Da doo~! All of our heart pancakes are ready and now it is time for my favourite part. It is time to decorate, and one of the things that I really love about this recipe is it's totally customizable. However you like to eat your pancakes, you can get creative with it. For example: using the small heart cookie cutter, cut out a small, little heart into the butter, and then place it right on top and pop it out, and then drizzle a little maple syrup on top. Look at that! So cute! Another idea: I've used the small heart cookie cutter to cut out a bunch of fresh fruit. Over here I've got strawberries, we got these little heart strawberries. And you can place those on top with some powdered sugar. You can also do the same thing with a banana! You just open it up, cut up some pennies -- Boop! Boop! and then, cut out some hearts. Da doo~! And there you have it. Homemade heart pancakes. I've decorated this one using some of my favourite fruit, but you can use whatever you'd like. The next thing that we're gonna be making is: "I love you" avocado toast. To make this "I love you" avocado toast The things you'll need will be: some slices of your favourite bread, -- I'm using a wheat bread fresh arugula, eggs, lemon, an avocado, salt and pepper to taste, and a heart-shaped silicone mould. The first step to making our "I love you" avocado toast is making our avocado spread. I love avocado toast, and there are hundreds of ways to make an avocado spread, there are so many different things you can do. But I'm just gonna show you what I like to do. It's very, very simple. In front of me I've got a cutting board and a ripe avocado To cut an avocado, you're just gonna cut all the way around, twist open, to get this out I just like to go "Boop!" and give a little twist, then use a spoon to scoop all of the fresh avocado into a small bowl. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum! Then, squeeze some fresh lemon juice into the bowl. You can use as much lemon juice as you like. Next a little salt and pepper to taste. Now mash together using a fork, get all of the ingredients work together. This recipe makes 4 pieces of avocado toast, or 2 if you really love avocado. [Whispers] Like me. Now pop a couple of slices of bread into the toaster I'm gonna be setting mine on a medium, golden-brown setting, that's how I like my toast, and wait for it to toast! [Singing] Your love is a one-in-a-million. It goes on, and on, and on. [Stops singing] Now that our toast is ready, we can put our avocado spread on top. Just scoop up a little, spread over the top. An important step is not to eat it right now, which is what I want to do. I'm hol- I'm h- HUH Then I like to add a few sprigs of arugula. I love fresh arugula, it's so yummy. *sniffs* Ahh! Yum, yum, yum. Oop! [Singing quietly] Your loooove is a one-in-a-million. Oh this has holes in it. I like arugula. [Whispers] I like it a lot. [Singing] Dooo~ Oh that's... dumb, that one's dumb. Get out of h- oh that one's dumb too. Not that a plant can be dumb, but. There! Toast is ready, now I'm gonna quickly cook up some eggs on the stove, sunny side up. We are gonna take over some eggs, a heart-shaped silicone mould, some butter, a non-stick pan, and a spatula. Over to the stove! Turn your heat to medium-low and grease your pan, I'm using some butter. Once the butter is completely melted, put the greased silicone heart mould in the centre of your pan. Crack the whole egg into the mould and allow it to cook for a few minutes. Once the whites of the egg have set, carefully remove the silicone heart and take your egg back to the baking station. Last step. Place your egg on top of the toast and then they're ready to serve! Da doo~! Here is the "I love you" avocado toast. The next thing that we're gonna be making are heart-shaped cinnamon rolls. To make these heart-shaped cinnamon rolls, the things you'll need will be: ready-to-bake cinnamon rolls, I'm using Pillsbury Grands!, an 8 inch round cake pan, white glaze icing, and some heart sprinkles to decorate. The first step to making our heart-shaped cinnamon rolls is to open our ready-to-bake canister. The one I'm using is by Pillsbury, called "Grands!". I really like this one because the strips are longer and a little larger and the other ones I found at the store were a little too small for what we're doing today. Opening these is really easy, you just peel and pop. So you find the little beginning right here, and then peel, peel, peel. *Quick tearing* Then give it a pop! *Thud* Just like that. Da doo~! Get off of there, get off of there! *Rattling* Now I'm using a ready-to-bake cinnamon recipe because I wanted to save a little bit of time. But! If you have the time and you want to make a from-scratch, amazing cinnamon roll recipe, I have a good one. I'm gonna put it down below in the description so you can check it out down there. In front of me I've got a piece of parchment paper which my cinnamon rolls are on, and I'm gonna show you how to shape these. What we're gonna do is make them look like hearts so we are going to unroll, and we're gonna roll the ends. Roll, roll, roll, roll! Until they look about even, then you're gonna bring down the middle. Stick 'em together so they look like a heart! Then place it into an 8 inch round, greased, and lined cake pan. We've got all of our heart cinnamon rolls lined up in the pan they are ready to bake. I really love this idea because if you have anyone who loves cinnamon rolls, this is such a fun twist on a traditional breakfast treat. Now turn your oven onto 350 degrees and bake for about 15 to 17 minutes. Our cinnamon rolls are fresh out of the oven, I popped them onto a plate to make decoration a little bit easier. This part is totally optional, but it makes 'em pretty cute. I took the white icing that these cinnamon rolls came with and put it into a piping bag with a number 6 tip at the top for a little bit more control. For decoration just drizzle on top, and then sprinkle on some heart sprinkles. Now our heart-shaped cinnamon rolls are ready to serve. Da doo~! Nahh! It's a little heart! Ta daa~! Here are the 3 Valentine's day breakfast ideas that we made today. We made homemade heart pancakes, "I love you" avocado toast, and heart-shaped cinnamon rolls.

I thought I would make a quick video because I am making some edible Valentines Day Treats for my friends. And I thought, maybe some of you might need a last minute Valentines Day Gift Idea. I’m basically making cookies with Cookie! She’s been stuck to my side all morning! I don’t really know why, she just always wants to sit with me today. Cookie, do you want to be my valentine, is that what’s going on? Today I’m gonna be taking a traditional Valentines Day Conversation Candy, and giving it a modern twist. I’m gonna be making sugar cookies that look like the candies. I love all the pastel colors. But we’re gonna be writing more modern, popular sayings. Because these conversations, they’re cute, they’re classic! Let’s Kiss, Crazy For You. XOXO, they’re just not as modern as I like, so let’s get started! To start off, you’ll need to make sugar cookie dough, I used the almond sugar cookie recipe from my Nerdy Nummies Cookbook, but you can use whatever recipe you like. The reason I use this one is because it holds shape of cookies very well while it bakes, I love this recipe. I’ll put a link down below to where I’ve made it before. The things you’ll need to make this dough will be: 3 cups of all purpose flour, 1-1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon of sugar, 3/4 cup almond meal, 2 sticks of salted butter at room temperature, 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/8 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 a teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg, 1-1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract. The first thing that you’re gonna do is roll your sugar cookie dough to be about 1/4 of an inch thick, lightly flour the top, so that our cookie cutter doesn’t stick. And now you’re gonna take a heart shaped cookie cutter and we’re gonna cut a bunch of little hearts. I’ve done a lot of baking on this table, I like to hang out here and decorate! Sometimes Mo and I watch movies while I’m decorating little cake pops. It’s so comfy Cookie fell asleep already! She’s like, wake me up when the cookies are done! Remove the excess dough, I’m just balling it over here and then I’m gonna re-roll it and make some more cookies. I’ve got a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper, and you’re gonna transfer all of your cookies over here. And what I really like about this recipe is that they don’t expand too much. They really do hold their shape! This is why its 1 of my favorites. Once you’ve got your cookies on the sheet, what I’m gonna do is pop these cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes, this will help the sugar cookie hold its shape while they’re baking, just a fun tip! After they’re chilled in the freezer you’re gonna pop ‘em into the oven and bake ‘em at 350 for about 12 minutes. You’ll just want to take them out before they start to brown! Cookie, you’ve been so patient that I’m gonna give you a little heart shaped dog treat! Yeah, I found those at the store! Good girl! Once your cookies have baked and had plenty of time to cool, you want to make sure that they’re not hot anymore, because we’re gonna be icing them! If the cookies are still hot, it will melt the icing, you don’t want that! This is the fun part! It’s time to decorate! I like want to have a cookie party right now because look at all these colors! This looks so fun! That would be a fun idea for Valentines Day! You could invite a bunch of friends over and have a cookie decorating party! You can come if you want. I get a lot of questions about what type of icing I use, and this is a royal icing, I made this from scratch, it’s super easy, all you’ll need is 5 egg whites, 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 4 cups of powdered sugar. You just mix it up, and then dye it the colors you want. I used a bunch of different food colorings to make them look like the pastel colors of the conversation hearts, and ta-da! We’ve got the rainbow! Alright, so what you’re gonna do is you’re just gonna take a sugar cookie, and ooh let’s start with purple! Look at this you guys! I’m living, I’m learning, these are little rubber covers that go on top of the tip so that your icing doesn’t dry out! And then here, I just scooped a bunch of my royal icing into a plastic baggie, I put a number 4 tip at the end, for just a little bit more control. You don’t have to do this, you can just use a ziplock baggie and just cut a small little hole at the end. Cookie! You’re supposed to be helping me! These are really easy to ice. The first thing that you’re gonna do to decorate is outline all of your cookies. 1 thing to look out for is if your icing starts to run off the side of the cookie, the icing is just a little bit too thin, so just add a little bit more powdered sugar, to thicken it up! And on the other end of the spectrum, if you’re having a really hard time piping, you can add a little bit of water. You can ice them all the way to the edge, but I like to leave a little bit of room, showing my friends that these are some fresh sugar cookies! Henny, what are you doing over there?!?! After you’ve piped the outline of your heart, we’re gonna let it sit for about 5 minutes to harden, before we fill it in. It’s kind of creating a fence, to hold all of the icing. So I’m gonna sit it off to the side. And, ice some more! I’m gonna be icing my cookies all of the colors that I have up here, except for red, we’re gonna be using red to write on the actual conversations. Alright now we’ve got our cookies all outlined and we’re gonna fill them in with icing! Which, is called flooding, there’s a little bit of baking terminology! Now we’re gonna flood our cookies! Flood them with icing! Which is the yummiest kind of flood. And I do Zig-zags back and forth, bew-bew-bew-bew-beeewwww! And then I like to take a little toothpick, move the icing around, fill it in. Just make sure it all touches! This is why I like to use royal icing on cookies, because you get a very smooth finish once it’s set. And then you’re gonna do this to the rest of your cookies. Now it’s time to use our red royal icing, I’ve made the red royal icing a little bit more thick by adding a little bit more powdered sugar. I do this because when you’re piping on letters, I really want them to be firm and hold their shape. They’re a little bit more detail oriented. Now I’m gonna pipe some popular conversations, I was thinking of some while these were drying. And the first one that came to mind was BAE! Gotta give a cookie to your BAE! Alright, here’s our first 1, it says BAE! Next I’m gonna pipe ILYSM, I Love You So Much! Now I’m gonna pipe the rest of my cookies and come up with some fun conversations. I really like this idea because if you have any inside jokes with your friends, or family members, or a special someone, you can pipe some of those little words on here too! Ta-da! Here are all the Conversation Heart Sugar Cookies that we made today! It was a very fun twist on a traditional Valentines Day Candy! We’ve got: Text Me, Senpai, Relationship Goals, Ship It, Yes Queen, I love you so much, On fleek, or it could be eyebrows on fleek, up to you, up to you! Swipe right, for all my girlfriends using Tinder. Keepers to the right, creepers to the left! My squad, Pizza? BAE, DM Me, and Netflix and Chill, which is probably how I’m gonna be spending my Valentines Day! And, let me know in the comments down below what you would put on a Conversation Heart Cookie, because I’m probably missing some things. I hope you guys enjoyed them, this is a very fun, last minute Valentines Day gift idea, and I hope you have a good Valentines Day, bye-bye!Hey everyone, this is Lisa and today we're gonna make the best and easiest valentines day cookies ever!

Don't forget to subscribe to my channel. Music provided by Lovekavi at Lovekavi.com- Hey guys, today I'm gonna share with you a terrific recipe for Valentine's Day that's perfect for gifting. So if you have a special Valentine that you wanna bring a sweet treat to, whether that be a boyfriend, girlfriend, or a teacher, or really anybody you love, a linzer heart cookie is a great idea. They're also really simple to make too, and most of it can be made in advance. So let me show you how to make them. Alright, so the first thing we're gonna do is beat up a cup of butter in an electric mixer. Now you're basically just looking for that butter to become pale in color, and basically double the volume. At that point we're going to add the sugar. So for these cookies I really like to use powdered sugar, or confectioners sugar as you may know it, because it's a lighter sugar and will incorporate a bit better into the butter. Because this is a sandwiched cookie where you're dealing with two cookies, you wanna make sure that those cookies are nice and light, and kind of melt in your mouth. Otherwise it can be a bit heavy. You wanna just add it slowly and in stages because it is pretty dusty, and if you put the whole thing in there you're gonna make a big cloudy mess. So just go ahead and take it in probably thirds. And then you're just gonna beat that up until it's nice and incorporated. At that point we're going to add one egg and one egg yolk. The egg yolk is just gonna create a really nice rich flavor to our cookie. At this stage I also like to add two teaspoons of almond extract. You'll find it'll get a really nice subtle almond flavor to these cookies, which I think is such a great flavor combination with the raspberry jam. Then we're gonna prepare our dry ingredients. So in a small bowl you're going to add one and a half cups of almond meal. Now almond meal or almond flour is essentially just ground almonds, so if you can't find it, I'll put some information in the description on how you can actually make your own, but I find, especially if you live in the states, you can find it easily at Trader Joe's. And it's such a time saver. But in fact you should know that it's never near the baking aisle or near the flours, it's always in the nut section. So you can go and find it there and you 'll find a big bag of it. It's great. Then to that we're also going to add two cups of all-purpose flour, half a teaspoon of salt, and a quarter teaspoon of baking powder. Go ahead and just whisk that up until it's all combined, and then we are going to add this flour mixture to our butter mixture just in thirds, beating in between each addition until it's nice and combined. Then we're gonna remove our dough from the bowl and we're going to separate it into two mounds and place it on some wax paper. Then you can flatten it into some discs and wrap it up. And we do need to refrigerate this dough for at least two hours. Overnight is even better. Just because it's gonna be so much easier for us to roll out and cut out our little cookies. So you do wanna plan ahead and make sure that you refrigerate it in advance. Now to make our cookies, it does make it a bit easier if you have a linzer cookie cutter. So you can usually find these at your kitchen stores, or I've also put a link in the description to where you can find them online. And if you like to make these kinds of sandwich cookies, they are a great investment because they usually come with a base and several little inserts that you can swap out to make different cutouts. So we're gonna be using the heart cutout to make our heart shaped cookie. So we're gonna take our first batch of dough, roll it out on a floured surface just to about an eighth of an inch thick. And then we're gonna cut out all of the bottoms. And you'll see it really helps when the dough is nice and cold because it will help us get a nice clean cut. And then once you've done about 12 bottoms you can go ahead and just pop that in the refrigerator while you prepare the tops. I find if the dough becomes too warm it begins to lose its shape as it starts to bake. So it's better that the dough is nice and cold. So at this point we're gonna take the heart insert to our cookie cutter. We're gonna insert it in the center and then we're gonna cut out all the tops. Then you'll see it'll have a beautiful little heart in the center. So you can go ahead and transfer that to a parchment lined cookie sheet as well. And then take the bottoms, pop those in the oven, and we're gonna bake at 350 Fahrenheit for just 10 minutes. You'll know when they're done when they start to just rise up a little bit and become puffed and look like they're set. You actually don't want to take them all the way where they begin to get golden brown because then they'll just get a little too crumbly on you. So just go ahead and take them out. And what we're gonna do is allow them to cool on the cookie sheet. And the benefit of allowing the cookies to kind of continue to cook this way is that the cookies will firm up due to the heat of the cookie sheet, but they won't become extra brown as they would if we'd left them in the oven. Then we're gonna pop the tops in the oven at 350 for just nine minutes. They take less time to bake because they don't have as much surface area as the bottoms because we've done the cutout. So they're a little bit quicker to bake. And then we're gonna allow them to cool the same way, just on our cookie sheet. And this whole stage can be done the day before. So all you have to do is just lightly cover them with foil and allow them to just stay on your counter tops, and they will be all ready to go the next day. Then to assemble, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna dust all the cookies lightly with some powdered sugar. Then we are going to transfer some raspberry jam into a pastry bag. I find that it's really a lot easier to work with the jam when it's in a pastry bag 'cause you'll get a lot more precision that way. But you could just spoon it out too if you didn't have a pastry bag. And then we are going to take the raspberry jam and just create a little dollop in the center of each bottom. Now the cookies are ready for their tops. So we're gonna sandwich them all. And then you'll start to see that beautiful raspberry jam come through the center of that heart cutout. You could take your cookies and place them on a cookie plate or you could package them up in a decorative tin. I find that these are such charming cookies, especially around Valentine's Day. They're not that hard to make and they are so delicious. The combination of that crumbly cookie with that faint almond flavor mixed with the raspberry jam is just the perfect little treat to enjoy on Valentine's Day. I hope you give this to somebody special and catch their attention with these. And I will see you next week for another easy recipe.

Music provided by Lovekavi at Lovekavi.comtoday's theme is tattoo inspired this cookie I made a while back and I've had many requests as to how I did it so today's tutorial I'm going to show you how incredibly easy this design was to make in the approximate center of this cookie we're going to paint some icing get a base coat here's my template which you will find on my blog okay now what I did is I cut out the center and we're going to be using this to create the shading we're gonna start by first creating the keyhole on the cookie and we're just doing that with a marker now we're going to be outlining this cookie about you know half a centimeter from the edge in red and so we're gonna find the center which is about here and we're gonna do a circle in black you can go about like here and there's our keyhole and that's it if you have trouble getting really dark colours you might want to try this product it is the rainbow dust food gel and they're the ones that two ended marker you know with the two size tips I added you know a small squirt and look at how deep the colour is this is the claret and so yeah you might want to give this a shot for red and black so you don't have to add too too much all right next step of the project were outlining about 3/8 of an inch or half a centimeter from the edge in your center colour you don't have to make it in red whatever colour you want ok now I'm outlining the key hole and I'm flooding right away and so by colouring on the keyhole I didn't have to mix in mix up a black batch of icing and I created my outline I just brushed on the white coloured it in let's do the other side now we're gonna wait for this to dry say about an hour just so we can handle it safely without damaging the surface I'm really liking this colour and a shake to get the ripples out and we're gonna let that dry we're going to start by shading the red area before alright I've got black in here and I'm hitting right on the stencil here don't pull up too high your gonna get your cookie all black here we go and now when we lift this off we have the line to pipe on the templates going to be on my blog and the link to the air brush that I use is under this video now we're going to be working on the outer perimeter of the cookie and when you're doing gold it's important to have some base colour before you do your luster dust if you just add gold luster dust to white icing you're not going to get a very deep gold colour so you better to add some gold or yellow to your royal icing just to get a base color some background so that when you apply your luster dust it's it's not too flat by airbrushing with that stencil you see we created a line to follow and so now oh I hit there we're gonna outline the cookie with gold and a 1.5 tip the line is very easy to see hit right on there we go this cookie is really not complicated so and now the whole outer perimeter of the cookie and then we're gonna flood the gold area there's the flooded cookie we're just gonna flood the yellow area or gold area I should say if you have several of these to make you could very well stop right here it's going to be very nice once it's painted gold keep it simple but if you want to you can add a few lines to the gold to make it look a little bit more like an authentic locket here is the gold you just painted on I'm running low so I'm gonna mix up a little bit more I've got a wide flat brush and you can just go quickly on the areas that aren't really close to your other colour and then you can come back in with a smaller brush for the detail here here are the cookies and you can see here with the little bit of added detail and this one does not have it but it's all about time and how much time you have to put on the design the people who look at it will not know that this was an option they only see this and they're gonna think it's perfect so it's up to you if you feel you wanna go that extra little bit Thanks for watching and see you next time!(Music) Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking Fortune Cookies Hi Bold Bakers! For Valentine's Day, I wanted to share with you the perfect recipe to show someone you care. And what could be better than homemade fortune cookies? Also, today is another episode of my Chocolicious series over on the Kin Community Channel so after this video make sure you go over there and check that out because I have another great Valentine's Day dessert ready for you. So let's get baking! You can really get creative with these fortune cookies and even customize your own fortunes so make sure you stay tuned until the very end of this video to find out your fortune. In a large bowl, we're going to add in our room temperature egg whites, vanilla extract, freshly squeezed lemon juice, vegetable oil or a flavorless oil, and water. And then whisk all these together for around 15-20 seconds and you'll see it gets a little bit frothy. The good thing about this recipe is that it can all be done by hand, which is great. To this, we're going to sieve in our dry ingredients: our flour, sugar, corn starch also known as corn flour, and salt because all baking needs salt. It's good to use a sieve because it gets your ingredients nice and fine. Then whisk all these together until you have a smooth batter. It will just take around 10 seconds until you see no more lumps. And that's it, that's your fortune cookie batter. It is that easy. Now I know you're probably thinking not the yummiest ingredients went into this but believe me when it bakes it tastes really good. Now we're going to color this batter. You can color it any color you like but because it's Valentine's Day we're going to add some red into it to make it really pop. I'm going to divide my batter in half. Leave one batch plain color and add red food dye to the other. When adding in your food coloring, less is definitely more. So just add in a little bit, mix it around and see if you've gotten your color. And if you haven't, just add a tiny bit more. Once you color your batter, I like to put it in the fridge for around 20-30 minutes and just let it relax and get nice and cold and it makes it much easier to spread. Now that our batter is cold, it's time to shape and bake our cookies. When making your fortune cookies, it's important to use a nice, thick baking tray--something that doesn't burn very easily. And then on that, we're going to lay some parchment paper. I like to put cookie cutters on the corner of the tray just to hold down the paper. Now measure one tablespoon of your cookie batter. And then gently with the back of your spoon spread it out until it's around 4-1/2 inches wide both ways. So just take your time and go around and around. I know this seems kind of big but believe me when you fold it over it will be perfect size. For the second cookie, stay a few inches away from the original one. These are big cookies and we're actually only going to cook two at a time and I'll show you why soon. These cookies are definitely a labor of love but when you get the hang of it, believe me it will be all worth it especially when you give them to somebody you care about and you see the look on their face. Every fortune can be unique so we're going to do different designs on each one. I'm adding two dots of red batter on opposite sides. Then take a toothpick and run it through the batter to make a lovely heart. You'll see these designs come to life when you bake them. We're going to bake these cookies at 325 degrees F for roughly 12 minutes. While these are baking, we'll continue making cookies. I'm adding dots of white batter to this red one and then making lovely hearts all around the rim. These are going to be so pretty. This Valentine's Day if you're looking for something for the chocolate lovers in your life then head over to the Kin Community Channel where as part of my Chocolicious series I made a simple and decadent Chocolate Soup. And if you like this recipe and you want to see lots more like it then don't forget to subscribe to my channel. You can get just as creative with your fortunes as you did with your fortune cookies. I'm going to put a template of fortunes on my Facebook page but you can use any that you want, even using emoji, personalized messages for the one that you love, pictures, the possibilities are endless! So here's a very important tip to know before your cookies come out of the oven: they harden really fast once they hit the air and that's why we only do 2 so we keep them nice and soft. If one of them goes hard while working with the other one, don't worry about it. Don't throw it away. Put it back in the oven and let it go soft and it will and then you can mold that one. So remember don't throw them out just pop them back in the oven. Another thing is, you have to touch them with your hands and they are very hot to mold them so what you want is a nice clean pair of kitchen gloves and this will protect your hands from the heat and you'll be able to work with the fortune cookies much better and get a nicer shape. I didn't use kitchen gloves because I have years of experience. Also, you'll need a mug of any size and this will help shape your fortune cookie because we're going to mold it over the side of the mug. You'll know when your cookies are ready when they go a little bit brown around the edges and you can tell that the dough is totally cooked. Now you don't want too brown because they will be hard to mold. When your cookies are out of the oven, leave them on the hot tray because this will keep them nice and soft. Run your spatula underneath the cookie to lift it up. Then flop it over put your fortune in the middle and then fold over your fortune cookie. You might have to lift this up to do it. From here, we're going over to the mug and fold the cookie over the mug in half and you'll see it take the shape of a fortune cookie. You're going to hold it here for a few seconds to let it set in the cool air and it will harden. To make sure that it keeps its shape, you can pop it in a cupcake tin and let it go totally cold in there. Look at how beautiful our fortune cookie is. Like I said, they're a lot of work but when they come out looking like this it's well worth it. We're going to make more so we can give them away as gifts for Valentine's Day. Flip over your cookie and add your fortune. Then shape them on your mug. And there you have it, your own personalized fortune cookie. After making these gorgeous cookies, I definitely think we deserve to crack them open and see what our fortune is: Fortune favors the Bold--it sure does! Let's see what this one says: We have lots more No Machine Ice Cream videos to come so get excited guys. That's a tasty message. Yumm!

If you're new to my channel please be sure to subscribe and if you haven't subscribed, hit that subscribe button in the notifications so you'll be notified whenever I have a new video. Today, I'm sharing with you my spin on pancakes done three different ways. This is some cute ideas for a morning breakfast if you are lost for what to do for Valentine's Day. I created the Strawberries &amp; Cream, and I also created a Chocolate Hearts &amp; lace, and lastly, the Chocolate Coco Love. Isn't it cute? (rhythmic, romantic music) So let's head into my kitchen so that we can get all the tools necessary to make these pancakes. The cooking tools, as well as the ingredients, will be linked down below this video so it'd be easy for you guys to actually just snag 'em up. Lindor came through this year for the strawberries and cream Valentine's Day gift. Isn't that adorably cute? It's the main ingredient in the first set of pancakes we're about to make. Now all these tools and stuff, like this gold, I got from Target. I'm so excited. It's so cute. This heart-shaped pancake maker thingy, I think I got that from Target, as well. I'll leave the link down below for you guys. The gold spatula and the gold measuring cups, as well as the measuring spoons, those all came from Target, as well. Target came through. Target was on it. This came Target, as well, too, the little heart-shaped thingy. And this squeeze bottle. You have to have a squeeze bottle because we're gonna actually make pancakes that's gonna require that and it's BPA free so it's not harmful plastic, and it's easy squeeze. And you can also store your pancakes in the refrigerator so yeah, you're gonna need that. But first you're gonna need some pancakes, you guys. So pick out the ones that you feel that you can make on your own. I went with these all natural ones that you can get from your local grocery store. Or the ones that are gluten free that are the almond pancakes. Those work, as well. You're gonna need a frying pan. Any one will do, but I like to use my old school skillet, cast iron, and I like this one 'cause it's really, really, really old, and it has a smooth bottom. The ones that are in the market today generally have a bumpy bottom and I don't really like it or it's painted and I don't like that either. Go ahead and make your pancakes according to the instructions on the box. Mine, I just added some eggs, oil, milk, whipped it up really quick, and made sure it was free of lumps 'cause we're gonna actually put it in this bottle, and we're gonna squeeze it on into our heart-shaped pancake (brief pause) iron thingies. Anyway, these have to be well oiled, you guys. Okay, these were on Amazon. A lot of reviews said that the pancake sticks to it, but the reason being is because you have to oil the actual, I'm gonna call it apparatus. You have to oil the apparatus so that they're easy to come out. Look at that. Isn't that beautiful? They just came out beautiful. I love it when the first set of pancakes actually work. Like, when they just cooperate 'cause generally you have to throw out the first pancake. Isn't that how it works? But this one. Let me show you. Let me show you. Hold on a minute. Hold on. Ah! Look at that. I am super excited. My pancake came out cute. It came out cute. It did. (laughter) Let me stop. But this one wanted to be a little bit stubborn. Uh oh, I'm nervous. I got it, I got it. Okay, I got it. I got it. See. I got it. Aren't they cute? Yes. My pancakes came out cute. Thank you very much. And now I'm just gonna put these over here on this plate. It's the little things, right? Next up, we're gonna add the edible lace that I got from Amazon and we need to add it to the pancake while it's warm because it makes it softer when you actually eat it. It comes in multiple colors, but what I did was I lined up my rose, centered onto the pancake. You can do it on either side if you choose to, but I chose to put it in the middle 'cause it looked the best. I'll definitely leave a link down below the video so you'll know where to get them. Well here is the yummy part. The Lindor strawberries and cream truffles. We have to melt these. It took about three truffles per pancake so just melt that for 30 seconds or however long it's gonna be in your microwave and spread that all over the pancake. Yum, yum, yum. Next up, we are about to poke through some strawberries. This is the O for the love cookie cutter that I showed you earlier and we're just gonna create some fruit to go inside of the pancakes. You can use any fruit. You don't have to use strawberries, but I just thought the strawberries were super cute, especially with the colors and, you know, strawberries and cream, I kept with the theme and then just drizzled.. I melted some more.. Actually, I think this is the same melt and just drizzled it all over the strawberry pancakes and cream. Yum. And finally, after adding the lace to the top of the pancake, be careful. Do not add so much of the cream on the top pancake because the lace will sink right into it and then it'll cover up the lace, and it just looks bad. So just don't add a lot of cream to the bottom, but that cream is addictive. It's so good, you guys, that I just ate it out of the bowl off camera. (laughter) It was so good. I'm embarrassed, but it was really that good. It actually taste better melted. Those little truffles taste better melted. And finally, I added some of the Wilton's red sugar sprinkles to mix in with the strawberries and cream. It really made those pancakes pop. You ready to create some Chocolate &amp; Lace? Well I took some confectioners sugar combined with that coco and made a chocolate heart pancake. I took the lace, centered my rose on top of a warm pancake, and I took my barbecue brush, dipped it into confectioner sugar, and I just dabbed it onto the pancake to create this amazing looking rose. How beautiful is the detail in that? The catch here is you actually have to take oil and kind of brush a light amount of oil over the pancake, not butter 'cause it doesn't work, to actually make it look that deep and detailed if that makes sense because when I tried it with butter it didn't work and I had to start over again, but it looks really good with the oil. And again, your pancake has to be warm when you lay that lace on top of it because it just kind of melts into place, but if it doesn't, you can just always hold it down and then brush your confectioner sugar on it. But it looks really cute, right? It does. It does. I'm very proud of myself for creating this. And if Cupid doesn't shoot you with his arrow, it's okay. We can make our own chocolate love pancakes starting with this Viva Cacao Powder. It is amazing. You guys have to get it. Mix it up with your pancake mix and put it inside your squeeze bottle. L-O-V-E spells love all day, every day. It sure does. Make sure you take the cookie cutters and rub oil onto every part of each metal cookie cutter because it's very important. And then go ahead and squeeze your pancake mix right in as fast as possible. The hardest one to get out was the strawberry one, but the other ones were pretty easy. Just make sure you use a pair of tongs. But before you took them over, take your spatula and kind of loosen them first because it might be a little tough. And then just use a butter knife before you take it out to just kind of line it around and push it down onto the pan before trying to take it out because you might break it and you'll have to start all over, and that would suck. And I know this from experience. (laughter) I had to make over the E. As you can see, I tried to rush to get it out so take your time to get it out, but don't take too long 'cause you don't want it to get cold. But, again, there's that oil in the pan. That's the oil you brush onto the actual pancake when you're adding your confectioner sugar and it will keep the pancakes moist enough for the sugar to stick to it and look really, really pretty. So just take your little barbecue brush and brush on as much confectioner sugar as you want to spoil yourself because that's what I'm doing. I'm eating all of these pancakes all by myself. Yes I am. And, again, there's that Wilton's sprinkles. This time I'm sprinklin' the heart on there, the red and the pink ones, along with some regular sprinkles that you use for ice cream. And just get your syrup or some whipped cream and spray on there with some fruit if you want to, and present it on a nice plate. Get you some mimosas and you can enjoy Valentine's Day by yourself, with your boo thing or with your neighbor or your teddy bear or your dog. Do dogs have Valentine's Day? I don't know, but they should. Get the dog a bone. Happy Valentine's Day, you guys. Thank you so much for watching. Hey, give this video a thumbs up. Subscribe to my channel. I will see you in my next video. Bye!Come on, come on, come on, come on, we gotta’ get out of here. Must go faster! How do you like it now, my friend? Would you like to take it for a test drive? I just did.- Hey guys, it's Desiree. Valentine's Day is coming up, and if you're looking to make something sweet and delicious for your friends, family or your significant other, I have just the thing for you. These dark cocoa hearts are actually filled with this fluffy delicious strawberry champagne filling. It's so easy to make, and they look really impressive and fancy, like they came from a candy shop. All you're going to need are some Candy Melts and three easy ingredients. To get started, you're going to want to pick up one of these silicone molds. It's 12 cavity hearts, and melt down some dark cocoa Candy Melts in a decorating bag. I'm going to start off just filling these heart cavities. You only want to fill these about one-third of the way up the mold. Now that I have my mold filled, I'm going to take a food-safe decorating brush, and I'm going to paint the chocolate up the sides of the mold. Remember, we're putting a filling in these, so we have to create a candy shell to hold it. Once you have the mold completely filled, put it in the freezer for five to 10 minutes or until the candy is set. While my candy is chillin', I'm gonna make my fillin'. I'm going to take 3/4 of a cup of Marshmallow Fluff, a 1/4 cup of strawberry preserves, and a teaspoon of the Treatology Crisp Champagne flavoring. Give this a stir until it's all combined. Nothing says Valentine's Day to me like strawberries and champagne. Now that it's all mixed together, I'm going to put this in a disposable decorating bag. It's going to make it way easier to fill up the candy hearts. I've taken the mold out of the freezer, and you can see that the candy is firm. Now, I'm going to take that strawberry champagne filling, and fill each of these three-quarters of the way up. I'm going to tap this just a bit to let the filling settle before I add the last layer of Candy Melts. Now I'm going to take the rest of my Candy Melts and cover up all of the hearts. Give the mold a good tap to make sure everything is nice and level, and then pop it back in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes so that your hearts completely set. Now these are completely frozen, so I'm going to give the sides a tug here to help loosen the candy from the mold. It'll just make it easier to pop them out. Then I'll put each of them on this baking sheet covered with parchment paper here so that I can decorate them. These turned out awesome. Even I'm impressed with how easy that was and how great they turned out. Now I just have to finish them off with some decorating. I have some Candy Melts candy here that I'm going to just drizzle over the hearts and add some sprinkles. And there you have it, a simple, impressive sweet treat that anyone will love this Valentine's Day. You can gift it to somebody special, or you can have them out for friends and family. I personally host a galentine's party every year with my girlfriends where we get some wine, food, desserts and these will definitely be out this year. All right, I can't resist this any longer. I have to try one. Mmm, this gooey filling is awesome. If you enjoyed this video, give it a like.
