this is a quick valentine's craft based on my pipe cleaner a hearty toriel i'm going to make this spiral heart with pipe cleaners glue them on the foam paper and a piece of foam tip and maybe decorate first I start with spirals and tooth spirals already made one spiral so I'm going to now make another one and show you how it's done I'm working with two spirals pink and glittering white I make a spiral around the barbecue stick pink is first then the glittery one follows that makes the pink be dominant okay I want more of pink damn that's why I tell you move the excess alright so I squeeze it however I want my heart quite big that's why I can squeeze too much let's see so I kind of like play a little bit I want symmetrical and proportional but not too tight not too small okay so here's one and see okay there's room to squeeze I just squeeze perfect so here I have two pipe cleaner spirals I take another pipe cleaner and I go through my spirals somewhere in the middle I Bend then I push my spirals toward the in the middle I shape a heart and don't worry we'll we'll have time to shape it I twist I dream of Texas and ship again and because the spirals are quite form they allow you to M to shape as a stable shape my heart is ready now I have the my hot glue gun and I want to glue the heart on the piece of foam paper let's cut the heart see with the scissors I cut a nice hard shape now look at the back it's almost the perfect heart okay now the only thing is left is to decorate it kind of believe in less is more so I will only decorate it with this add a little flower now if you have any of this letters you know you can you can stick a letter inside or maybe whole world you just don't have enough letters and then maybe you can also decorate it with beads here I have another heart so please notice this heart I made with again two spirals but this bottle has two regular red pipe cleaners and I squeezed it probably too much that's why my heart is quite small once again I want to glue it on the piece of foam and also maybe I will decorate it with this little bead I don't even know if you can see because it's a tiny red flower with tiny red flower and that's it I can cut out the heart what else do you need to know if you want you can take your piece of foam and before you glue your heart you can pinch a hole in the foam that way you will be able to hang it see there's a hole right there and you're done this is what they look like from behind phantom pretty you can even glue together two of this if you want it's a very cute craft enjoy you
