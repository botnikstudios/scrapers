today's theme is tattoo inspired this cookie I made a while back and I've had many requests as to how I did it so today's tutorial I'm going to show you how incredibly easy this design was to make in the approximate center of this cookie we're going to paint some icing get a base coat here's my template which you will find on my blog okay now what I did is I cut out the center and we're going to be using this to create the shading we're gonna start by first creating the keyhole on the cookie and we're just doing that with a marker now we're going to be outlining this cookie about you know half a centimeter from the edge in red and so we're gonna find the center which is about here and we're gonna do a circle in black you can go about like here and there's our keyhole and that's it if you have trouble getting really dark colours you might want to try this product it is the rainbow dust food gel and they're the ones that two ended marker you know with the two size tips I added you know a small squirt and look at how deep the colour is this is the claret and so yeah you might want to give this a shot for red and black so you don't have to add too too much all right next step of the project were outlining about 3/8 of an inch or half a centimeter from the edge in your center colour you don't have to make it in red whatever colour you want ok now I'm outlining the key hole and I'm flooding right away and so by colouring on the keyhole I didn't have to mix in mix up a black batch of icing and I created my outline I just brushed on the white coloured it in let's do the other side now we're gonna wait for this to dry say about an hour just so we can handle it safely without damaging the surface I'm really liking this colour and a shake to get the ripples out and we're gonna let that dry we're going to start by shading the red area before alright I've got black in here and I'm hitting right on the stencil here don't pull up too high your gonna get your cookie all black here we go and now when we lift this off we have the line to pipe on the templates going to be on my blog and the link to the air brush that I use is under this video now we're going to be working on the outer perimeter of the cookie and when you're doing gold it's important to have some base colour before you do your luster dust if you just add gold luster dust to white icing you're not going to get a very deep gold colour so you better to add some gold or yellow to your royal icing just to get a base color some background so that when you apply your luster dust it's it's not too flat by airbrushing with that stencil you see we created a line to follow and so now oh I hit there we're gonna outline the cookie with gold and a 1.5 tip the line is very easy to see hit right on there we go this cookie is really not complicated so and now the whole outer perimeter of the cookie and then we're gonna flood the gold area there's the flooded cookie we're just gonna flood the yellow area or gold area I should say if you have several of these to make you could very well stop right here it's going to be very nice once it's painted gold keep it simple but if you want to you can add a few lines to the gold to make it look a little bit more like an authentic locket here is the gold you just painted on I'm running low so I'm gonna mix up a little bit more I've got a wide flat brush and you can just go quickly on the areas that aren't really close to your other colour and then you can come back in with a smaller brush for the detail here here are the cookies and you can see here with the little bit of added detail and this one does not have it but it's all about time and how much time you have to put on the design the people who look at it will not know that this was an option they only see this and they're gonna think it's perfect so it's up to you if you feel you wanna go that extra little bit Thanks for watching and see you next time!
