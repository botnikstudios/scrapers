hi guys today I'm going to do a Valentine's themed dating video for you all I really loved Valentine's Day I know that some people really have love it or hate it but I just see it as another opportunity to do cute stuff like baking or doing things where I've been single about other when I've been single on Valentine's Day I love to do things like have all of my friends around playing really nice girly sleepover and when I've since I've been with Jim we always try to do something nice but if you stay in and like all the pizza or whether we go do that's a nice and fancy date or go to fit or what is something like that but I always associate Valentine's Day baking I think I bake every single year no matter what I'm doing and I'll just kind of give things to my friends or to Jim what most things are nice thing to do so today I thought I would do some red velvet cake jars so basically what notice I've got these little jars and I bought these from Amazon I will link in the description box where I got to anything from like the string and Lala's actually two things this February from Amazon and but anyway these withdrawals I'm going to do like red velvet cake broken up in there and then some cream cheese like cheesecake mixture then another layer cake fit over there with the cheese sticky stuff and then spring some cake on top and I just think will look really cute and Valentine's E and you can make these with your friends if you were having like a sleepover factor for Valentine's Day or if you're with someone you could make it give it to them I think it'd be really cute little Valentine's gift because we don't like to do that big expensive gifts on Valentine's Day it's nice to just make something for someone works the first thing we need to do is make the red velvet cake I've got my trusty KitchenAid so it's going to be Emma bits because if me such as literally throwing things in and you want to eat your oven I've already got my preheated to 170 degrees Celsius um let's do this so you need a hundred and twenty grams of butter don't where I have watch your hands and use my hands Angele 500 grams of caster sugar I just forgot I do often like to kind of like eat my butter first but try remembers have your buttercream capture as much in business I got that mixing like she was like say like making videos to this question myself okay I'm just gonna walk perhaps amazing that is our butter and sugar cream together I'm not going to add okay I love baking Oh amazing so now you want to get a separate little Bowl and you want to put in it 20 pounds of cocoa powder 1 teaspoon Japanese really cute in a cup a vanilla extract and 40 mils of red food coloring and we're just going to literally combine those three ingredients this is so weird it's like glob jelly oh my goodness - because I've just been writing my baking for a tiny bit for the last like a few months I have just totally run out of adjectives when I was writing it and I had to do all that have like recipe in trays and there's obviously a hundred of them and I had to think of different ways to describe cake and it got to the point where I was like I just have to use a thesaurus for this and there's so many ways you can say that something is nice and sweet and lovely I was having two words like magnificent cupcakes Oh suppose if you don't know I'm doing a baking book and it's very exciting and I'm actually going to the sheet of it after shooting this baking video which is really exciting it's been all of the food shots from done over about three weeks and still got this week and we did a week before I went on my honeymoon and stuff and it's just so fun to be on the shoe like so cool I think I'm going to snap chatting today guys okay so once this is all mixed up it should look like a paste smell we're getting really good at that look she's smart chocolate member and then you just want to add this to your mixture mixing together amazing so now I have 240 mill buttermilk and this is a really important ingredient that you can t miss out red velvet because it gives it up Frank velvet a unique taste I'm going to put in half of this then I'm just going to mix in cozumel then I've got 300 grams of flour and I'm just going to pour in half of that and mix and in the rest of buttermilk make threats the real hour oh we're out a little bit up redness is still going like a moon disastrous and I'm just going to use my spoon to get all of the electrodes with flour from around the edges of the bulb I haven't quite mixed in finally you want to add a teaspoon of salt that's kind of a nice and molten salt and a teaspoon of bicarbonate soda and three teaspoons of white wine vinegar that's another ingredient that's like unique to all of this is oh my god that's nothing really this unique to red velvet cake okay so now all you need to do is divide the mixture equally between three cupcakes or whoever you're going to cook the mixture basically guys we've had a technical disaster and we're not filming for a while so I'm just going to have to fill you in and tell you what happened and luckily you don't miss anything important so basically I have the mixture you saw the whole mixture get completed in the KitchenAid and from there I just popped into two cake tins and make the cakes in the oven for 20 minutes and then I took the cakes out and crumb like broke broken cakes up into pieces like this and I pop them into this bowl that's where our so you haven't missed anything like drastic like actually making anything you just knit missed me putting the cakes in the tins making them in the oven and then taking them out and now that they're cool so they're ready I've broken them all up and I broke them up to a bit cool quicker as well and because this is how we're going to put them jars are broken up um got to level technical disaster okay so now I'm going to make the like creamy cheesecake II kind of icing and I've got 600 grams of icing sugar here and we don't want it to be to either sing like because I think that would be too sickly we need to be more like cheesecake II so I'm using 250 grams of cream cheese but I'm like I'm just going to see how it goes I might use a little bit more I'm not sure so I'm going to put the butter in fasting butter I've got 100 grams of if I try to put it all in at once on my key theater mixer oops it's called 100 grams of butter 600 icing sugar and 250 cream cheese but we'll see how it tastes if it's two sisters whoa why does this always happen to me Oh God right I put a low okay I'm going to put a tea towel around this and almost slightly left icing sugar than planned inside it I can just feel it mixing and come to trust that it's working oh yeah it's mixing up the treats do you think I should wear a suit to the room because I put so much on the table I don't see how we go don't worry until I see looks a bit lumpy because I always find that when I use cream cheese icing that takes a little while is like staring around to get all the lumps out I'm just going to try a little taster of this to see if it's good I think that's really oh definitely is sweet but it's got enough cream cheese in there that it's creamy it doesn't taste like we're just having a mouthful of icing or anything if it's of a clean spoon now not the one that I liked that one is over there to get my cream cheese mixture out and I've got a handful of broken up piece of cake I'm just going to throw these into the water won't even put too many go and I think that's it I'm just going to push them down so look nice like they're filling it oh yeah that's the perfect amount so I guess like the little handfuls what you need to start with it's going to look so cute time to cream cheese and start with just like quite large dollop you know I've made a mess these are going to be trickier than I first oh I was like all of this easy but now I'm just putting them together but making them look in trustworthy is going to be tricky I think ok I'm going to start again but I'm going to just make this one look good off camera in a bit so I'll just set that one aside let's start again I just know put in less cake and let's cream cheese stuff ok so I'm just putting in enough to just kind of cover the bottom this time not too much like that I think should be perfect and with the icing I'm going to try really hard not to hit on the size of the jar so switch to a teaspoon now because the big spoons were just not very practical for getting at these times as your jar so I'm just kind of like spreading it out evenly I think that looks pretty good so I'm just grabbing pieces of cake again I want to make sure I put too much in because we've got to get as she might be nice but overflows a little bit so on the go to town with this cake layer a little warm the other one this cake feels so good guys it feels like I love how dense red velvet cake is so I'm just pushing it down like last times that's really have packed in there okay it was the final layer of cream cheese this one I have to get quite so worried about touching the sides feel like there's a little bit awake rounding off on the top this is really satisfying to do I just have to tell you guys this is great really therapeutic huh give it a nice little like piece on the top which is latrine unnatural and what's the word rustic so like really have that not perfect masterpiece cake smells all that and then the final touch is I'm going to put this down to it I'm just going to sprinkle some cake crumbs I'm so happy with this I think it seriously looks so cute and I love the little prongs on the topping as a pedestal finishing touch but I'm going to add the little strings because I think they do need a bit of decorations so so I'm just going to tie this around do a little bow I'm actually not very good at doing phones this guy's gonna find stuff about me Jim always loves to highlight my shoelaces this is a depart from something yeah how can I get both bits for the bottom I don't know I think that it's really cute now again that is one case jar finished I've now got to do five more or four more and rescue the one that was my first one which is better to laughter but I love this so much I'd be so happy if someone gave me this about Wednesday so a guy sees that on my finished Valentine's cake jars and I think they'd be so cute and I know that they taste amazing because I've been tasting them along the way and if you guys make these at home please tweet me a photo because I would love to see and tweet me a photo of whoever you are enjoying the cake draw with whether it is a boyfriend or husband or some friends and you having a sleepover I'd love to see what you get up to and how you get on making the cake jars oh and don't forget to use the hashtag Tanya bakes and I thought we should just start using it out before the book comes out on June the 30th and I just hope you guys have really happy about sign saying lots of love hi
