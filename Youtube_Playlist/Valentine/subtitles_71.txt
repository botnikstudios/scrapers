opening music I've got some royal icing here that I've added a little bit of gold color to and I diluted it and now I'm covering my surface of my cookie in this royal icing very thin amount it is just to give a nice finish to the cookies surface it will be exposed from the decoration im gonna be cutting a hole in the fondant gonna start by adding the wood element to the cookie here's the cookie ready with a layer of royal icing dry on there and now I'm rolling out some marbled brown fondant and I marbled for another project and if you want to see that video I show how to marble the fondant you can look in the links below alright now I've got this textured mat a nice wood grain position your fondant where you'd like it to get if you want some knots such on your fondant there we go now we're gonna peal that off now I have two crutters the cutter that was the size of the cookie which is this one here im cutting remove your excess and now I have the center cutter place that in the middle cut your hole but leave the fondant there that will help maintain this shape of the fondant or else it will warp if you pick up just a the outer perimeter like that it'll all get weird and misshapen just leave it upside down like that now we're going to take our cookie and we're gonna put it upside down on the fondant position yourself look on the other side make sure its centred press on the edges where it's gotta be glued so that it adheres onto the cookie and then you can flip it now here you can gently push it to the edge fondant has elasticity we're not using this and then you can just rub it on and it doesn't matter if the the inner heart is a little bit warped we want this to look like you know when you see those hearts dug out of a tree that's what we wanna look we want to look so it doesn't have to be perfect the next step here I created a a heart around the heart in kinda branches added a little bit of sprinkles to look like baby's breath and then some fondant flowers here are my flowes I made in in advance using seven for each cookie hear I've got some brown royal icing in a three tip and now I'm creating a jagged heart I want it to look like branches don't use royal icing thats too stiff or it'll pop off your fondant it won't stick now im gonna put this in my bead tray and I'm just going to sprinkle it with the sprinkles here while it's wet so they stick I just wanna add a bit of detail to it its quite brown but its a less girly version of a Valentine cookie alright now that that is done and the royal icing is still wet we're gonna add our little flowers we're pressing them into the wet royal icing we wanna do this while the royal icing is wet so that it squishes and not breaks the pink is a necessary there for the design design or else it's not very pretty you can make the flowers any color you want just something to brighten it up yellow would be nice as well i don't know if you can see here the remnants of my work but I didn't like how it lined up and so with a brush i kind of rubbed off the royal icing and I'm gonna start again I wanted a question mark and so I think it works better if you work from the bottom backwards you write your message backwards and here is the question mark and then mine and then you here and then the wood and this way I can fit in as opposed to this one I have the question mark now for the last element of this cookie the leaves I have electric green here and you can do a leaf tip where the leaf is a little bit kind of up but you will inevitably get breakage and so I'm opting for a runnier icing and im piping a dot that I'm pulling and it'll make a more kinda sturdy design should you perhaps be shipping this or bagging them and this is a two tip at the flower im just doing a dot and pulling and thats it add as many as you like rotate your cookie to facilitate doing it try to get them to rest on the cookie like I say if you want to avoid breakage you could certainly make these leaves out of fondant but it is more time consuming than working in royal icing often these little kinds of touches if you do them in royal icing it doesn't really affect the taste if you don't like royal icing but you really can crank them out much quicker and here is the finished cookie a little kind of shabby chic country look closing music
