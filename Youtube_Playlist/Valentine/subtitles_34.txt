[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey yo welcome back in this video I'm gonna show you how to make these really cool candle holders out of items from Hobby Lobby and Walmart I did have a request on Facebook for someone they said that they did not have a Dollar Tree close but they did have Walmart and Michaels in a Hobby Lobby so this is what I came up with I hope you enjoy it the candles on top are just basic candles that I got from the dollar tree and I decorated them with foam hearts if you're gonna do that please do not like them as foam as flammable so use battery powered LED lights if you're going to do that stay tuned and I'll show you how to put them together alrighty so let us get started you're going to need some of these little wooden circle plaques I got these at Hobby Lobby they're the 5 inch ones they were $2.99 and you get them in a 2-pack and all I have done is I have painted them white with some plain white acrylic paint I'll explain these holes here just in a second you're also gonna need some dowel rods I got this pack of eight dowel rods at Walmart they are made of real wood accept no imitations made of real wood you get two of each different diameter and the pack and then I got this pack of a little styrofoam hearts here these came whoa get in the camera dummy this came from Walmart they're like these little hanging styrofoam ornament type deals you get six of them for two dollars and 84 cents they look like that they are so cute you get six for two dollars and 84 cents you're also gonna need some type of glue I suggest wood glue but I can't find my wood glue right now so I'm gonna be using hot glue and I do use gorilla brand glue sticks they are really good for gluing wood together so I'm okay that I don't have actual wood glue I'll just use this if you want to no you don't have to if you trust your your glueing capabilities but for me I drilled a hole and each one of these so if you do that then of course you're gonna need a drill but you will have a drill or you don't want to do that you know - then just glue them down there's not really gonna be a lot of pressure on these you know I mean it was just a candle but anyway I wanted to make mine a little bit more sturdy so I took the dowel rod you know this one was like the quarter inch in diameter dowel rod got a quarter inch drill bit just drilled a hole so that you know this could fit down in there and I'm gonna glue it in as well let's see I think that's all that you need also to trim your dowel rods with of course I use my trusty wire cutters that I use for everything and that is it so basically all that you do is you take a dowel rod and I've already got this one started and you just take your star from hearts and you push them on to the dowel rod so I'm trying to see if I want to do quite red or white and I'm thinking now that I look at it I'm thinking that um it may look better if I do two red and one white so yeah I want to push that up there and a little trick here is because I have made something similar to this before if you've been following my blog for a while I made something similar with other shapes that weren't hearts and as I push them down to the dowel rod it's like the end broke off it cracked and broke off so if you take something I'm just going to use a paintbrush and just go down in the end of it and just kind of pave the way for your dowel rod before you actually press the dowel rod into it it helps a little bit so that of the ends don't go come on you know and and break off and then you know you're sad and you're gonna cry because you know it just didn't work for you but if you do that it helps a little bit so I'm going to slide these to the end and then I just take the heart and then I just slide it onto the dowel rod and you know I don't want to make a video of me you know drilling holes and painting and all that because you know I'm trying to not bore y'all to death so let's just press this and I don't want trying to not put too much pressure see a little bit of it came off but it's okay you can't really see it that looks okay so then I want to take this and I want to put just a little little bit of glue down in this hole here and then I'm going to take the dowel rod just insert that into the hole just like that let's press it down in there hold it for a few seconds this is exciting right watching me glue stuff watching me glue things I just let that sit like that okay I'm sorry for the weird camera angle I'm working on getting some more cameras set up different camera setups here so y'all can see things better and now I'm going to check this in I think that'll be just fine no it's okay maybe I don't so this is what we have went for this glue to get hard before I really go any farther but yeah just like that so I'm looking at this and I'm thinking I need to trim off just a little bit more this whoopsie see like I said I use wire cutters for everything hey they're sharp they work okay so I'm gonna put a little bit of glue into here I'll try to tip this over to the side so you could see it better see and now that is touching the top of that heart there so now I'm just going to well this is what we have so far now I'm just gonna set this up over here and let the glue harden and that's all that you do basically you just run the dowel rod through the center of your hearts you can make it as tall as you want or as short as you want just use one heart if you want to use one or two it doesn't matter run the dowel rod through them glue to your little white centerpiece here and that is what you have so pretty simple although it's not from Dollar Tree you know that someone had had said on Facebook that you know they can't always get to a Dollar Tree but they did have a Walmart close and you know did I have any ideas for any Walmart crafts and you know that's that that's the idea that I had for a Walmart craft so you know I hope it helped you there we are so if you would please give this video a thumbs up click subscribe check me out on other forms of social media I'll put the links to all of those in the description box down below and I hope to see you all next time bye bye
