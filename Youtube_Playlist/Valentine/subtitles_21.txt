hi this is Tracy from gift-basket appeal and today we're gonna be making these super cute paper holders to hold our little candy treats and this is going to be perfect for Valentine's Day so let's get started the nice thing is is that you'll get to use some of your stash and it doesn't cost a lot to make these I got the little candy treats from Dollar Tree they came in a pack so you can make a bunch of these now this paper pack actually is from Mei Mei made it it's called wedding bliss but it had these hard papers in there that I thought were really cute and this is a six by six paper pad and I think it's just super gorgeous look how pretty this is and so for my treats I can pick just about any of these this is the heart paper that we're going to be using the black and the pink and white it's a double sided paper you can do stripes if you want you can use whatever paper you have and when I was looking through this I was thinking you know what these would be nice little party favors or bridal shower favors or you could even do baby shower paper so you can pick whatever paper you have get that paper out of your stash and start using it so for this I'm going to be using this mini score pal but you don't have to have a score pal to do this these are I cut these six inches of course this is six inches so it's already done for you but right here is two and a quarter but I'll make sure I put the measurements below and I'll put all the material that I use for this project also my little Snickers is the measurement I'm going to use now I do have some Twix bars and so depending on the size of your bar is is what size you're going to cut your paper so I wanted to make sure these would fit and so when I first saw this I was like you know what these are too long and I said you know what I can take some tape because you know how as crafters are we like to it to whatever situation we have and so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take this just a tiny piece of scotch tape I'm gonna tape these ends back so that I can have it measure at around two and a quarter inches so I didn't want those sides to be sticking out but it's up to you and you can make a bunch of these you know for Valentine's Day or for an office party it just depends on what you want to do okay so this of course this is another side that I could use but I'm gonna use the side with the heart so look how pretty that is that's gonna actually fit right in between there so once you've measured that out the width of the candy bar that's how are you gonna do this now with my mini score pal this is actually I have a larger one call the score pal this is the score buddy it's a little mini one I'm going to mark my little paper here and so I need it to be at least an inch this part this way it's an inch so I hope I'm being clear on that this way it's going to be measuring an inch and let me secure that a little bit more with my tape here we should be ready to go okay so I'm going to score this at two and a half turn it this way and score it again at two and a half and you don't need a score buddy to do this okay and so this is the part where our candy bar is gonna sit okay so let me just put this aside and you can do a bunch of these you know I'm gonna go ahead and do this one also so I can use an achievement either side but I think what I'm gonna do is I I love the heart so you just want to make sure you know what parts you want facing out two and a half there and two and a half and this all comes together you'll see and guess what they're super fun to make ok so once that's done once this is done like that I'm going to go ahead and fold this up see how easy that is and fold this up alright so you want your candy bar just sitting in here so it's just kind of like a little chair for your candy bar okay and remember I folded down the ends so they wouldn't stick out just like that and it just sits like this okay so all I'm gonna do now is I've got some double-sided tape and I get this tape from Dollar Tree and I do want I don't want my candy bar to slip out so I'm just taking a little bit of this tape putting it right there putting it right in the middle up here and then I'm folding this up and look how adorable that is now I'm going to punch a hole in there and if you want to punch before you can I just decided I'll punch after I can hold it in place but whatever works for you is fine okay I'm going to punch it up there because I'm gonna need to tie this up okay so let me just go ahead and really get a good fold on that okay make sure when I tape is on there yep and then it makes it just really easy to pull this off okay let's see now and this is my first I've made several DS already just for practice and I was just super happy with the way they came out and if I can do this you can too and so always looking for easy ways to give gifts and I thought this was a super easy one so now I'll do it is just pulling my ribbon through here just get some pretty ribbon you can get red for Valentine's Day or if you're making a specific kind of theme then go for it with whatever colors you want for that thing okay so I'm just kind of giving it a little double knot one way and then I'm gonna nod it the other way okay just like that and so that's what you have already so now you get to just do add a little bit of decoration to this so what I'm gonna do is just use my my little hearts that I already have cut out you'll see how fast this is going and I just want to show you what I use to cut this heart out this is one of my stickers it's really super tiny now what I could have done is just stick it on here but I wanted to use this as a template so now I could either do this which to me it doesn't show up as much but when I flip it over like that I added some stitching to it and everything I can do it like that but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just use this right here because I think that pink looks really cute so you just have fun with it and just try different things so I'm just gonna stick it on with either I could use some double-sided tape you have options I just like to show you different options you can use your art glitter glue if you want I'm gonna just use this right here this is my ad tech crafters tape I'm gonna stick it on there and I could be done but I think it needs a nice little ribbon somewhere off to the side and see I just kind of tilted my I don't have to have it straight I just tilted my heart just a little bit and now this is where you can start using some of your thin ribbon so I'm just gonna make a really quick bow here see just about finish this one this is where you can start to use all your little ribbons up here so you'll do it this way so nothing fancy I'm just making a cute little bow but wouldn't it be nice to leave this on a desk for one of your co-workers or your child can leave this on the desk for a teacher super simple doesn't cost much just get a bag of candy and just go to town start creating because I like to find like really easy and fun stuff and you can get fancier and fancier with these it's just up to you but imagine for a bridal shower get your paper packs your cardstock and stuff and just start making some stuff okay so I'm gonna just cut these down cuz it's Anita a little bit too long yeah so you can have fun making all of this awesome stuff you can put little gems on here pearls imagine for a bridal shower or baby shower just put little pearl things on there if you know in advance that it's a girl or a boy you can do that too okay so now I'm gonna take this add a little bit of glue to this just this tiny dot of glue okay and so some of you have mentioned that you having problems with your glue gun and the strings a tip I learned from another youtuber was that she took the glue gun and when she saw the strings come she just kind of twirled it around and the strings went away because I know those little glue strings could be kind of aggravating so that was a nice tip so now I can just put this on here like that and now I've got a cute little bow look how adorable that is and I can keep adding different things to this I don't have to leave it like that but if you want you can leave it like that or if you if you want here's another idea I have all of these why am i saving all of these hearts get all of your stash out and start doing these little hearts I think this will be nice for a teen party also that's just just me thinking outside the box here now I can take one of these hearts and maybe put one off to the side you use my art glitter glue here so you can make a ton of these and you not just sending them up on the table so that each person can have a little favor to take for coming to the party or whatever a celebration you're having I can also take my gel pen um like I did here on this heart I just took my red gel pen and just went around the sides here so you all you have to do is just measure it just like how I did um if you want to come longer on the top you can I'm thinking I could possibly stack some of these but then you'll have to kind of measure the height to be longer you'll have to use maybe a 12 by 12 paper and kind of cut it down to fit but that would work too so I mean you can stack these so you see how that looks on the inside there I'm thinking stacking some of these candies on top of each other just putting some double-sided tape and stacking them and then you can have kind of a more than one basically so you can do as many as you want so let me show you the other ones that I did look how cute that is aren't those just the most adorable things here's another one just using your scraps of paper to create the hearts and just mix and match them so I hope this helped you I had so much fun making this and I know this was a short video but I just wanted to show you how super easy these were so you go ahead and get your scraps out and don't forget to join us over in our
