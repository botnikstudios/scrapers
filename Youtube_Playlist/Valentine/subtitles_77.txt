Hey everyone, this is Lisa and today we're gonna make the best and easiest valentines day cookies ever! So here we go! You will need 4 tablespoons coconut flour, 4 tablespoons tapioca flour, 1/8 teaspoon baking soda, a pinch of salt, 1 tablespoon oil of your choice, 12 drops of red food colouring, and 2 tablespoon honey. Add in the egg, vanilla extract, honey, oil, food colouring and mix them all well. Grab your cookie cutter and place in a spoonful of the mixture. Use a toothpick to mould the shape properly. And if there anything sticking out after you take out the cookie cutter, use a toothpick to fix any bumps or frays. For full baking instructions, click on the link below in the description box.
