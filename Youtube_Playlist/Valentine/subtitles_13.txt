hello it's me Gemma and I'm here at the crumbs and doilies shop in Soho and we're getting really excited about Valentine's Day and I'm sure you are as well and if you were wondering what to make your Valentines for Valentine's Day why don't you make little vanilla cupcakes for the secret heart baked inside I'm just about to make some so why don't you follow me in I'll show you how it's done right the first thing I'm gonna do is bake some pink sponge which is gonna be the heart that goes inside the cupcake for that I've started by greasing and flowering two eight-inch tins I'm probably not gonna need all of these but I can't really split this mixture any further so I've got my mixer here and to that I'm gonna add 200 grams of caster sugar and 200 grams of softened unsalted butter and then just whack your paddle in and you want to beat that for a few minutes until it's really pale on white and fluffy right it's gone really pale and fluffy so it's now time to add the eggs as you can see it's completely changed color so I'm going to pop that back on on a medium speed and crack in my three large free-range eggs mixing quite well between each one okay my back is starting to take shape and it's all silky smooth and the eggs all mixed in it's looking really good and now I need to add the flour and I've got 150 grams of plain flour and 50 grams of self-raising flour and I'm going to just sift that straight into the bowl and then I just want to mix that really gently or fold it you can do it by hand but I've got a handy setting online mixer which folds it in really carefully and slowly right that's folded in really gently I don't want to overmix it because I don't want to knock out all the air and then lastly I've got a tablespoon of whole milk and I've put a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract in there mix it really well now I need to make that pink so I've got my food color paste here it's a claret that's the color of it and I will be quite generous with it so I'm going to take a kind of pea-sized blob and mix it really well into that milk so once that's all mixed in you just need to add that to the batter and again fold it really slowly you can do this by hand if you're worried that's almost mixed through I'm just gonna finish that by hand so I'm going to scrape all that batter off the paddle and then give it a really careful but fora mix around scraping the sides and once it's all really thoroughly mixed you need to put an even amount into each tin and then level it with a palette knife once these a nice and level you just need to bake them at 160 degrees C for about 20 minutes or until they're cooked all the way through all right my cakes are out of the oven and I'm gonna leave them to cool and they're gonna come back in about 20 minutes my cake came out the other notes they've cooled down now and I'm just gonna take one of them and using a cake leveler which is this I'm gonna level off the top by taking that crusty bit off the top you can use a serrated knife for this just make sure it's nice and long and make sure you did it really evenly so you can see it's all lovely and pink inside that sponge and I've got our little heart cutter here and I'm just going to cut out 12 hearts from the middle of my cake they're just gonna leave those to do their thing just sittin there and meanwhile we're gonna mix some cupcake batter so I'm gonna just use it a simple vanilla cupcake first of all I'm going to sieve 125 grams of self-raising flour and then add a quarter of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda 125 grams of caster sugar sift that all through and then to that add 125 grams of softened unsalted and then I've got two large free-range eggs I'm going to crack those in and get it mixing I'm starting on a slow speed and then increasing it until it's beating quite well beat it for about one minute it's been beating for about a minute now so I'm just gonna knock it down to the minimum speed and I've got one and a half tablespoons of whole milk in this little jug and I'm gonna add a quarter of a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just stir that around and then I'm gonna pour that in while it's still going and then increase the speed and mix it for about 30 seconds all right I've had about enough of mixing now so I'm just gonna scrape all the batter off my paddle give it a little stir around just to make sure that everything's mixed really well and then using a spoon I like to do scoop an even amount into each case of your cupcake tin here I've got 12 but once you've done that then you to put your secret heart right into the middle of your cupcake so grab your heart and just push it right into the middle of the cake batter all the way down to the bottom but once they're all in we need to pay them but first of all just you probably notice that put them all in the same direction so that's so that you know because once it bakes and once you covered it in icing you're not going to know which around these hearts are so when you cut into it could be any which way so keep them all in the same line and we'll ice them all in the same line and that way you'll know so now we need to bake them at 170 degrees C for 18 to 20 minutes depending on your oven or until they're completely cooked all the way through so my cakes are out of the oven and they're completely cool and meanwhile I made some vanilla buttercream and if you want to learn how to make vanilla buttercream then click on the link now I've put my buttercream into a big piping bag with a nice big fat round nozzle on the end and I'm just going gum with icing them now you'll notice that I've kept all my cakes pointing in the same direction so the hearts are all kind of lined up vertically and that's so that I don't lose track of where the heart is because I'm going to cover them up in a sexy and I've also made some little red sugar paste hearts I just rolled out some sugar paste and cut them using my tiny little heart cutter and I'm going to put two on the top of each cake and that way you're going to know if you cut through the middle of your hearts so there they are little vanilla cupcakes with a hidden surprise inside and all the remains now in the big reveal look at that work perfectly little hidden vanilla a surprise inside this delicious vanilla cupcake one half for you one half for your loved
