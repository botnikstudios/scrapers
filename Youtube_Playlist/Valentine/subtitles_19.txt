over my head through last Phineas sick so Chris maybe you it doesn't roses so I'm wearing a heart sweater so obviously that means that this is another Valentine's Day themed video because Valentine's Day is coming up so I decided to show you guys a bunch of really cool and easy Valentine's Day treats that you can also turn into really cute Valentine's Day gifts for your friends your family your boyfriend cuz we all know that guys love food then again I like really love food probably more than guys so I'm not ashamed oh and this is my little unicorn she's soaked and I have been bouncing off the walls all day today because I couldn't wait to tell you guys about a really really exciting announcement so I am so excited to tell you guys that I'm actually going to be coming out with a spring clothing line of air pistol which actually launches February 2nd like what February 2nd that's like a week but if you guys want to see some of the clothes that are in the line before even comes out then you guys know to do just tweet hashtag more Moda and if we get enough people to tweet the hashtag then we can unlock some of the looks before the line is out oh and one more thing so the necklace that I'm wearing right now actually says motivator on it and throughout the day if I happen to see it in the mirror or something it just makes me really happy so I've been wearing this non-stop and I thought it'd be really cool if you guys got one too so they can be like our friendship necklaces so we are actually going to be giving out free motivator necklaces with any purchase that you make from my spring clothing line at Aeropostale and they're only available while supplies last you won't be able to buy it it's only gift with purchase so if you guys get anything from the spring line then look forward to getting a motivated necklace and then we can just rock them together and without further ado we're going to go ahead and get into the Valentine's Day treats and gift idea so let's get started so for the macaroons you are going to need three egg whites two cups powdered sugar one cup almond flour 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar so I'm starting off by pouring my powdered sugar in a bowl and mixing that with my almond flour you're going to want to put this in a sifter because you want this mixture to be as thin and powdery as possible next pour your three egg whites into a mixer and keep mixing that until it gets really thick and fluffy then I'm just pouring in my cream of tarter mixing that in and then you're going to slowly add in your sugar now you can add any food coloring that you would like to depending on the color you want of course I'm going with pink now combine your almond flour mixture with your egg white mixture but instead of stirring it you want to kind of fold it together just to get the perfect consistency and once it's kind of dripping off of your spatula it is ready to put in a piping bag and pipe it onto a baking sheet so I'm using this weird thing that kind of looks like a whoopee cushion and I'm just creating little dollops of the batter you can also get these really cool template things to get the perfect macaroon really depends on your preference but before you put it in the oven you want to tap it on the counter to get rid of air bubbles and then wait 30 minutes before putting them in the oven this allows them to kind of harden and get their shape then you can go ahead and put them on in to make a quick filling for the macaroons take 7 tablespoons of butter and mash that up in a bowl then we're just going to whisk two egg yolks and add in 1/4 cup of sugar then add 3 and 1/2 tablespoons of milk I put the mixture in a tiny little saucepan and put it on low heat and kept stirring it until I got kind of a pudding consistency now remember that butter we mashed up earlier well now we're just going to take it and add it to our egg mixture and then take one teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir that in now you can dye your buttercream frosting any color that your heart desires and then just put it in a piping bag and now we are ready to finish our macaroon so I'm just putting a little bit of the buttercream frosting on one of them and then putting another little patty I guess you could call it on top and they look like little hamburgers but they're not for a gift you can put these in a cute little v day box and give them to your friends or your family or you know you could just eat them all I mean that's what I would do yes you read that right Nutella brownies can we just ah you are going to need a teaspoon of vanilla a cup of Nutella half cup of sugar two eggs 1/3 cup butter and 3/4 cup flour start off by mixing your sugar and butter add the eggs your vanilla we cannot forget the Nutella get in my rubber and the last ingredient to add in is the flour now take a greased brownie pan and you're just going to spread your mix into the pan make sure it's evenly distributed and then we're going to pop it in the oven now when you take them out you should have delicious gooey Nutella brownies I'm telling you guys these are amazing you might not want to share but to get into the Valentine's Day spirit I cut mine now in cute little shapes and then I decorated them with sprinkles and frosting so you can definitely get super creative with this part and we're finished they are delicious but one out so this is a great Valentine's Day gift it's kind of a play on words because it's popcorn that says you're poppin get it so you're going to need popcorn some red and pink candy melts and some Valentine's Day M&amp;Ms so I started off with taking this cookie sheet with wax paper and spread out my popcorn and next you just want to melt your colored chocolate once it's melted just take a spoon and drizzle it all over your popcorn I joined the club and as you guys can tell I did the same thing with the red chocolate but you can use any colors that you prefer there's something about hanging out but so it can stick and while the chocolate is still melted you just want to throw on some M&amp;Ms and you're finished so once it is completely hardened you can put it in some little cups or for a gift idea you could put it in a mason jar and then decorate the mason jar with some little duct tape or whatever you can find and then of course you cannot forget that you're poppin gift tag which totally goes with the theme of this and I'm warning guys right now this popcorn is actually addicting it is so good so I definitely think whoever receives this will love it talk nerdy to me don't ever okay I'll stop so this is one of my favorite gift ideas just because it is adorable so you are going to need Valentine's Day nerds some cute glasses gift tags some twine and a sharpie so the steps for this one are pretty self-explanatory you're just going to pick a little vase and fill it up with some nerds and I chose some really cool shaped ones that I got at Michaels and because this is a little play on words I got this little gift tag and I wrote talk nerdy to me on it get it okay maybe not anyway I drew some little glasses and remote controllers just to kind of get in the theme of it and then you just want to tie that on to your little jar and we are finished with that gift idea so this one's really cute because it kind of resembles an arrow you know bow and arrow for Valentine's Day so I found these little popsicle things at Michaels and what I did is I just filled them up with different kinds of candy so whoever you're giving it to you could just fill it up with whatever their favorite candy is I chose some Valentine's Day themed candy of course then I found some sticker glittery fell at a craft store and I just drew out a little triangle cut it out and I put it on the tip of our little cake pop holder then I cut out these small little rectangles and I put those on the bottom of it so that it looks like an arrow and then you can just get really creative you could add ribbon stickers whatever you want to then we have a really yummy and festive Valentine's Day gift to make a red velvet milkshake you're going to need vanilla ice cream milk some vanilla extract and some red velvet cake mix and of course a blender so I'm starting off by putting 1 cup of vanilla ice cream into my blender and then adding half a cup of milk and 3 tablespoons of my red velvet cake mix then pour in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix it up Boober oh and you got to have a milkshake dance doll then just pour it into a glass and you can decorate it with whipped cream sprinkles whatever you prefer this is perfect if you're having a Valentine's Day party or if you're just obsessed with red velvet cake like me and the last one Valentine's Day floats okay so all you really need is some type of soda and some sorbet or anything like that so I found this raspberry sorbet and I put it into a cup then I just poured in some strawberry soda and that's about it these are honestly so good I can't even explain to you guys and I can't believe they're so easy to make you could also use ginger ale or just any carbonated drink and they are adorable and amazing so that's about it for this video hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll talk to you later I I just waved my laptop weirdo at least I think I do oh we got that real this from Baja is one cross
