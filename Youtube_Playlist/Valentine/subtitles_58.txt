- The one place I could always find comfort was in food. And so I just kept eating. I was 684 pounds. I didn't understand how limited I was back then. I didn't know any better. I literally could not walk from my front door to the end of my driveway. That's how bad it was. I lost over 300 pounds, but when I first started my journey with Ideal Protein, I just did not want to do it. Now I look back and I wish I would have started it six months sooner. (laughs) I couldn't enjoy life at 684 pounds. I was living, but I wasn't alive. Now, I'm living and I'm enjoying life. And I'm making the most of it. I want to make up for all the years I've missed. And I want to be able to enjoy my life again. And I can do that because of Ideal Protein. (dramatic music)
