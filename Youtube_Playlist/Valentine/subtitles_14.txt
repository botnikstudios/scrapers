hey guys it's kawaii sweet world and today we're making these really yummy Valentine's Day cake pops these are so delicious and they're really cute as well for Valentine's Day so let's get started here I have a pre baked yellow cake this is just a box mixed cake and I'm going to go ahead and cut it into quarters then I'm going to crumble this cake into a bowl so just rub the cake back and forth and then break it up with your fingers until you get nice little small pieces and now I'm adding in another cake quarter so that makes for a total of half a cake that I crumbled up now I'm adding in some vanilla frosting I ended up adding in about a third of a cup to get it to the right consistency so go ahead and mix it around you want it to be just moist enough so that you can pack it into a ball in your hands here I'm using an ice cream scoop to start forming the cake balls and I'm just going to go ahead and pack it a little bit and then roll it into a bowl you want these to be about one inch in diameter and then just place these on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper to make a heart-shaped cake pop go ahead and take a cake ball and flatten it out a little bit and then pinch the end into a v-shape then use one of your fingers to make a little indent in the top and I should have a cute little heart shape and here's all of our finished cake balls place this in the fridge for about 20 minutes now for the decorating you need some sprinkles along with some candy melts I'm using the Bolton brand here place these into a microwave-safe glass and I'm just going to melt these on a low power setting make sure you stir them every 20 seconds or so when it comes out it should look something like this nice and smooth now take some lollipop sticks and insert them into the candy melts about 1/2 an inch and then place this into your chilled cake ball here I'm doing the pink and the red some people like to refrigerate their cake pops at this time but I found that if you dip them when they're too cold your candy melts are going to crack and you don't want that and to make really thin even coating I found this Wilton easy thins product and it's really nice it's kind of like paramount crystal and it's really going to help thin out your candy coating you could also choose to use some vegetable oil or shortening but here I'm going to use the easy thins go ahead and add this into your candy coating well it's still warm and just stir it around to melt this is going to make your candy coating nice and smooth and thin now we're ready to dip our cake bucks here I'm doing the white candy coating and then just tap off the excess and then for this one I'm adding a little heart sprinkle you can see how adorable this looks or you could choose to cover your entire cake cup with sprinkles this is one of my favorite looks because I think it looks so fun and festive for Valentine's Day and here's of the finished product will look like and here I'm doing some of my red cake pops you may have to remelt your candy coating a little bit but just make sure you do this on a low power and I'm adding on a sprinkle for this one too I have this really nice cake pop stand that I got from Target you could also use a styrofoam block to place your cake pops in to dry and here I'm doing the Hart cake pop you might have to rock it around in the candy coating a little bit to get it all coated but just be gentle when you're doing this and you can see these are really adorable as well and here I'm just going to drizzle it with some melted candy coating make sure you add in some canola oil to thin this out though as you can see I got some really thick lines it looks almost like a zebra print but I think it's so cute and if you want to add an extra touch go ahead and add a plastic treat bag I got mine at Michaels and just go ahead and tie it off with a bow I think that this makes it a really cute gift for a friend and that's it these cake pops are really easy to make and if you've never had cake pops before they just taste like a really moist cake so I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to share your creations with me on my Facebook page and I'll see you guys next time happy Valentine's Day
