hi everyone today I'm making Rose cake pops for Valentine's Day make this you'll need 200 grams of chocolate cake and 2 to 3 tablespoons of chocolate buttercream now I just bought my cake from the supermarket just to save some time rumble the cake between your fingers until it resembles crumbs and add the butter cream and mix with a wooden spoon until it comes together in one bump a little bit off and then roll it up into a ball you then try and roll it into a cone shape once you're done place this in the fridge for around 20 minutes well fetch chilling you can make the red buttercream so start by softening 100 grams of unsalted butter to this add 200 grams of icing she'll get in two batches and add a teaspoon of vanilla and give it another mixer then put a small amount of the buttercream in another Bowl and you'll need to dye this green for the leaves under the rose and go ahead and add your red food color need to add quite a lot for this amount of buttercream once the cake is chilled dip your sticks in either candy melts or melted chocolate push the stick right up to the top so it's nice and secure then place these back in the fridge for another 20 minutes then you'll need to fill a piping bag with your red Britta cream lay 104 petal tip and you'll need to position the nozzle and at the wide end is at the bottom ring around the bottom and then another ring around the top then build up the rows by doing sweeping motions open over whilst turning the cake cloth once you finished building up your rows you for tall loops around the bottom this might look a little messy around the bottom but you can tidy this up with your finger now the last thing to do is add the leaves to the bottom and this will also help to cover up any seeds you'll need to fill a piping bag with tip number 67 to make these leaves start at the bottom and apply pressure and slowly release the pressure as you pull up so there you have it how to make a rose cake pop for Valentine's Day you enjoyed this video remember to give it a thumbs up and if you haven't already check out my cheesecake Rose bite tutorial I'm going to share the video and come back soon see you next time
