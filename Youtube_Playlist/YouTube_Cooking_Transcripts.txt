[Music] I'm building a barn in my garden with a working kitchen and I love my architect I wanted to say thank you to his whole team and I thought what better way than to make them a wonderful lunch Miguel is doing the table for me it's gonna be amazing I think we have the blueprint for a perfect lunch for place cards and making short bread cookies in the shape of hammers with everyone's name on it and they're going to do double duty as dessert and a big lobster paella that's so easy to make I'm serving it with a refreshing grapefruit and avocado salad and to drink a lemony California iced tea I love when a good plan comes together [Music] so I've got a terrific blueprint for this meal I'm gonna have the entire lunch on the table when we sit down including dessert and dessert is gonna do double duty as place cards for the guests so what I'm gonna make first is I'm gonna make shortbread cookies in the shape of a hammer they're really cool and then I will write everybody's name on it so first I have to make the shortbread I need 3/4 of a pound of butter 1 cup of sugar butter has to be at room temperature so it's really soft and that means sometimes leaving it out overnight I'm just gonna put it on very low speed I don't want to whip it a lot I just wanted to mix together I just use the paddle attachment on my mixer you can also use a hand mixer once you spoon a good vanilla and then just mix it together until the butter and the sugar are combined I fainted meantime I'm gonna get the flour ready and it's going to have cups of flour I'm gonna put it in a sifter 1/4 teaspoon of salt just sift them together okay now I'm just gonna add it slowly to the butter and sugar mixture so these are gonna be both desert and the place cards it just starts to come together in a sec I'm gonna kill this for about 30 minutes until gets firm enough to roll out okay now that does just pull together which is perfect I'm gonna clear the jacks a little bit of flour this is really my favorite cookie I make all different kinds of ways can make it with almonds in it or cut toasted coconut this makes a lot of cookies but you can always save the dough I actually like to cut them out and freeze them okay just pull the dough together Pat it out a nice desk it's gonna roll it up in a little plastic wrap put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes that lets the dough relax it's much easier to roll out and it'll chill the butter just a little bit not too much perfect now I think I'm gonna find out when Miguel's up to why do I think it's gonna be just fabulous what a great idea so this Mike a block of wood and yes also voices on a block of wood they're gonna love this which we covered on um canvas I wish like painters drop cloth yeah exactly fantastic then I had some photo book is made of being over your blueprint yeah that's gonna be do I was a placemat skip - classic and what it is your scores those are fabric samples which I'm going to cut out and make them look like fabric sample yeah we're gonna hang there in the pergola that's just amazing cake it'll help your architects like they're gonna love it okay after my California is tea are you wearing your own yep okay go he'll see you later okay California is T is half ice tea and half fresh lemonade so first I'm gonna start with iced tea so I'm going to take four teabags good English tea I like to make a lot of it and then I pour four cups of boiling water on top and just let that steep oke I'm just gonna set that aside okay now for the lemonade fresh lemons got to do it so the first thing I need is freshly squeezed lemon juice I need one cup depending on the size of the lemons about five or six lemons [Music] apparently California is a really popular drink word has it that only Palmer drinks them and so now everybody there drinks it smells delicious these are big lemons so I got one cup of lemon juice out of about four or five lemons next I need 3/4 of a cup of superfine sugar are you super fun because it dissolves better and four cups of water [Music] okay give it a stir I'm going to take the teabags out of the ice tea okay pour that in okay I think I'll slice a few lemon slices and put it in I was like when it looks like exactly what it is perfect I'm gonna chill it I'm gonna serve it over ice that should serve about six to eight people it could be delicious so while this chills I'm gonna cut up my shortbread cookie place-cards and then I'm gonna make easy lobster paella I've been planning to ask the architect for lunch and when I went to a store and saw this cookie cutter in the shape of a hammer I thought that's perfect so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna roll out cookies and cut them in that shape and then put each person's name on it so they have a place card and a cookie to eat I'm just gonna roll the dough out I chilled it for about 30 minutes it just allows the dough to relax it's much easier to roll out I just want to keep the board floured you don't want to roll out the cookies and then you can't get them off the board I'm rolling it out to between a quarter and a half inch thick okay so that should be just about the right thickness so I'm gonna cut out eight cookies seven for everybody in one just in case and how great is there I put them on the parchment paper so they don't stick to the pan [Music] these are great cuz you really let the cut out cookies sitting there frigerator for a week and then bake them before you need them this is too much fun [Music] seven and eight I like to have a little bit of a shine on the cookies a little sprinkle of granulated sugar on the top does that cool okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 25 minutes - they're ever so slightly browned and then later I'm gonna write everybody's name on them and then Miguel will have them for the table setting mmm I love the smell of shortbread cookies those are gonna look great with people's names on them okay for lobster paella I'm gonna turn it up to 425 and I want to show you how I make really easy paella I actually used to avoid this because it was so complicated I thought why am I gonna bother making a big pot of things we have to cook everything individually so I decided I was gonna make it with lots of things I've already cooked and I'll show you how easy it is so first a quarter of a cup of oil and I'm gonna chop up some onions I don't wanted to have cups of onions so the first thing I did was I started on the cooktop but then I do most of the cooking in the oven so I'm not always standing over a hot pot and the second thing is instead of cooking each individual thing differently it has shrimp it has chicken it has sausage I decided I'm gonna use all things that are cooked like cook cabassa cooked lobster I decide to make it really special I imagine pan was the classic Spanish dish where you used up all the leftovers okay no saute those for about five minutes the meantime I'm going to cut up some red peppers so in order to julienne peppers so they're really nice-looking I'm just gonna cut straight down and then save that later for snacks and then just julienne about half inch strips this is a great dish to make when you're serving a crowd it's great to make it more quantities and you don't have to serve it the minute it gets out of the oven okay how the onions doing they're just starting to get a little translucent and put the peppers in and let them cook for about five minutes I just want to get the most flavor out of what you put in this is all gonna flavor the rice and then later I'm gonna add all kinds of delicious things to it put it in the oven okay the next thing is garlic I like lots of garlic so I'm gonna use like four or five cloves of garlic this can actually be a very inexpensive dish to make if you make it with cooked mussels and clams but I'm gonna make a special one today for the architects with lobster okay so about two tablespoons of garlic just put it in cook this for about a minute so the garlic doesn't burn okay next is the rice two cups of rice traditionally the Spanish use a short grain rice or a medium grain rice for this I like basmati rice I think it's really firm it's that great flavor so two cups of basmati rice and five cups of chicken stock you can use canned stock but I really prefer homemade okay now some great spices 1/2 teaspoon of saffron which is actually amazingly the stamens of crocuses keen vision collecting them and it's going to season it and it's gonna give a great yellow color 1/2 a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes give it a little heat not too so much that you can't taste the rest of the ingredients 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper okay just give it a big stir let it come to a simmer put the lid on put the whole thing in the oven for 25 for 15 minutes and then I'm gonna make an avocado and grape fruit salad me delicious [Music] you so the players cook for 15 minutes with the lid on and now I'm just gonna take the lid off oh that's a lot of pie just gonna give it a stir okay it's gonna be wonderful and I'm gonna cook it for another 15 minutes with the lid off and that way the stock gets absorbed and the pie a really cooks gets a little dry and then I'm gonna add Lobster and lots of good things so the shortbread cookies have cooled and now I'm gonna make them into place cards I just think it's nice for everybody to have their name on something so we make something that I can write with which is confectioner sugar and a quarter of a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice so that was a pound of confectioner's sugar a little bit of lemon juice just stir it in I want this to be thick writing consistency this looks like a lot of confectioner sugar but it ends up being very little okay it's slowly getting there it just takes a second for it to dissolve okay and here's the trick I'm gonna add a quarter cup of corn syrup which will make sure that it's free-flowing so it's easy to push through the pastry bag okay just mix that in okay that's it so this pastry bag I know it looks daunting but it's really not and it's got a coupling on it so that you can try different nozzles this is a small one but I think it's big enough to get the icing sugar through so just gonna put some I see in there okay so have to start with Frank Greenwald the architect Frank just do it slowly so you make sure you get it right Laura Joe like my short names and we go so the girls gonna join us like y'all this is amazing that's what you were doing with fabric and that's amazing these are place cards they're cooking in the shape of a hammer so can I leave in with you I'll read miss Alex good to go with the lobster pie I thought it'd be really nice to have something very refreshing like a grapefruit and avocado salad when I'm making something with avocado I always make a lemon vinaigrette because the lemon juice keeps the avocado from turning brown quarter of a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice tablespoon of mustard 1/2 just goes of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper when you whisk it together I'm gonna have a cup of olive oil so now while I'm whisking it was so much for the hours alone the mustard actually is an emulsifier kind of like an egg yolk so it makes the vinaigrette nice and thick okay so this is a Haas avocado it's brown when it's ripe I prefer them to the big green California avocados I think they have more flavor it's more concentrated they're from California but look how beautiful that is so just take the seed out just run your finger right along the inside of it [Music] and should pop right out just like that okay so I'm just gonna slice these lengthwise I find it's very hard to find ripe ones in the market so what I do is I buy them maybe three days before I'm actually going to use them and then they're perfectly ripe just like this okay and then I'm just going to dip them into the vinaigrette so they don't turn brown so we'll just make sure that avocado has some vinaigrette on all sides so it doesn't turn brown wallets sitting just arrange it nicely doesn't have to be so perfect what's about for house avocados it's good messy so the grapefruit so when it cut the peel off the grapefruit and I want to make sure that I get all of the white pith cuz it's really bitter and then because I don't like completel their membranes in the middle of the grapefruit I just like to cut the segment's out just put them in a big pile right in the middle it smells delicious okay we're just going to squeeze the rest of the grapefruit juice maybe a little cracked pepper on top so it's clear that its savory little drizzle of lemon vinaigrette and we have grapefruit and avocado salad all I have to do now is finish the paella oh my goodness that's a lot of Paia it's all the rice and the saffron and peppers and onions garlic just gonna be fantastic I just have a few things I want to add to it the first thing is some pear know which is anise flavored wine will occur and it's just gonna give it a nice fennel flavor so I need 1/3 of a cup just gonna turn the heat on a little bit mmm so all the liquids absorbed and it can really smell the saffron and garlic fantastic and this is the trick for really easy paella things that are already cooked so the first thing I have is one and a half pounds of cooked lobster meat I'm just going to big chunky pieces if the paella heat [Music] a little more expensive to buy it already cooked but certainly a huge difference in time I'm just gonna turn the heat off so the lobster doesn't cook anymore just steams and then I always like to do some kind of sausage but since Cabasa is already cooked Oh easy is that you can really find Cabasa and any kind of a really traditional Italian or its Polish sausage but any kind of it Adelie I'm gonna put in a pound of kielbasa just nice big slices so you can really see it okay that goes in okay and now another secret is frozen peas so all I'm gonna do really is put them in the hot rice and they're gonna defrost that's one 10 ounce package of frozen peas I'm just gonna mix it all in this looks amazing all the saffron rice and lobster kielbasa peppers mmm just going to fabulous and put the lid on and steam it for about 15 minutes and then I'm gonna serve it with lots of parsley and big chunks of lemon and lunch is ready [Music] all right Frank I have one question one's life aren't gonna be done I think it depends on whether we're gonna have lunch share everything so if I'm making lunch it's gonna take a longer time see all right you're done okay you can have your lunch record cheers huge difference in time I'm just gonna turn the heat off so the lobster doesn't cook anymore just steams and then I always like to do some kind of sausage but since koba's has already cooked always use that you can really find Cabasa and any kind of a really traditional Italian or it's Polish sausage but any kind of it Adelie I'm gonna put in a pound of kielbasa just nice big slices so you can really see it okay that goes in okay and now another secret is frozen peas so all I'm gonna do really is put them in the hot rice and they're gonna defrost that's one 10 ounce package of frozen peas I'm just gonna mix it all in this looks amazing all the saffron rice and lobster kielbasa peppers mmm system into fabulous I'm gonna put the lid on and steam it for about 15 minutes and then I'm gonna serve it with lots of parsley and big chunks of lemon and lunch is ready [Music] all right Frank I have one question one life aren't gonna be done I think it depends on whether we're gonna have lunch every day so if I'm making lunch it's gonna take a longer oops and then because I don't like communal their membranes in the middle of the grapefruit I just like to cut the segment's out just gonna put them in a big pile right in the middle it smells delicious okay I'm just gonna squeeze the rest of the grapefruit juice maybe a little cracked pepper on top so it's clear that it's savory little drizzle of lemon vinaigrette and we have grapefruit and avocado salad all I have to do now is finish the paella oh my goodness that's a lot of paia it's all the rice and the saffron and peppers and onions garlic just gonna be fantastic I just have a few things I want to add to it the first thing is some Perrineau which is anise flavored wine will occur it's just gonna give it a nice fennel flavor so I need 1/3 of a cup just gonna turn the heat on a little bit so all the liquids absorbed and it can really smell the saffron and garlic fantastic and this is the trick for really easy pea things that are already cooked so the first thing I have is one and a half pounds of cooked lobster meat person's name on it so they have a place card and a cookie to eat I'm just gonna roll the dough out I chilled it for about 30 minutes it just allows the dough to relax it's much easier to roll out I just want to keep the board flour I didn't want to roll out the cookies and then you can't get them off the board I'm rolling it out to between a quarter and a half inch thick okay so that should be just about the right thickness so I'm gonna

cutout cookies sitting there refrigerator for a week and then bake them before you need them this is too much fun [Music] at 7 &amp; 8 I like to have a little bit of a shine on the cookies a little sprinkle of granulated sugar on the top does that cool okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 25 minutes into there ever so slightly browned and then later I'm gonna write mmm I love the smell shortbread cookies those are gonna look great with people's names on them okay for lobster paella I'm gonna turn it up to 425 and I want to show you how I make really easy pea I actually used to avoid

Greenwald the architect friend just do it slowly so you make sure you get it right Laura Joe like for my short names and we go so the girls gonna join us like y'all this is amazing that's what you were doing of the fabric and that's amazing these are placed cards there's cookies in the shape of a hammer so can I leave him with you I run the salad good to go with the lobster pie I thought it'd be really nice to have something very refreshing like a grapefruit and avocado salad when I'm making something with avocado I always make a lemon vinaigrette because the lemon juice keeps the avocado from turning brown put of a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice tablespoon of mustard 1/2 dispose of salt half a teaspoon of pepper when you whisk it together I'm gonna have a cup of olive oil so now

all the saffron rice and lobster kielbasa peppers we just kind of fabulous and put the lid on and steam it for about 15 minutes and then I'm gonna serve it with lots of parsley and big chunks of lemon and lunch is ready [Music] you [Music] all right Frank I have one question one's life aren't gonna be done I think it depends on whether we're gonna have lunch here every day so if I'm making lunch it's gonna take a longer okay all right you're done for you okay you can have your lunch [Music] I'm building a barn in my garden with a working kitchen and I love my architect I wanted to say thank you to his whole team and I thought what better way than to make them a wonderful lunch Miguel is doing the table for me it's gonna be amazing I think we have the blueprint for a perfect lunch for place cards and making shortbread cookies in the shape of hammers with everyone's name on it and they're gonna do double duty as dessert and a big lobster paella that's so easy to make I'm serving it with a refreshing grapefruit and avocado salad and to drink a lemony California iced tea I love when a good plan comes together [Music] so I've got a terrific blueprint for this meal I'm gonna have the entire lunch on the table when we sit down including dessert and dessert is gonna do double duty as place cards for the guests so what I'm gonna make first is I'm gonna make shortbread cookies in the shape of a hammer they're really cool and then we write everybody's name on it so first I have to make the shortbread I need 3/4 of a pound of butter 1 cup of sugar butter has to be at room temperature so it's really soft and that means sometimes leaving it out overnight I'm just gonna put it on very low speed I don't want to whip it a lot I just wanted to mix together I just use the paddle attachment on that mixer you can also use a hand mixer once you spoon a good vanilla and then just mix it together until the butter and the sugar are combined I think the meantime I get that flour ready and it's going to have cups of flour I'm gonna put it in a sifter a quarter teaspoon of salt just sift them together okay now I'm just gonna add it slowly to the butter and sugar mixture so these are going to be both desert and the place cards it just starts to come together in a sec so I'm gonna chill this for about 30 minutes until gets firm enough to roll out okay now that does just pull together which is perfect I'm gonna clear the decks a little bit of flour this is really my favorite cookie and make it all different kinds of ways can make it with almonds in it or cook toasted coconut this makes a lot of cookies but you can always save the dough I actually like to cut them out and freeze them okay just pull the dough together Pat it out a nice disc it's gonna roll it up in a little plastic wrap put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes that lets the dough relax it's much easier to roll out and it'll chill the butter chest a little bit not too much perfect now I think I'm gonna find it when Miguel is up - why do I think it's gonna be just fabulous great what a great idea so this is like a block of wood and yes also horses on a block of wood they're gonna love this which we covered on um canvas oh it's like a painter's drop cloth exactly fantastic then I had some photocopies made of the of your blueprint like that yeah that's gonna do I would get the placemats exact and what it is yours works those are fabric samples which I'm going to cut out and make them look like fabric sample yeah we're gonna the pergola that's just amazing click it I hope you like you take tonight yeah they're gonna love it okay after my California is tea are you reading your own yep okay go see you later okay California is T is half ice tea and half fresh lemonade so first I'm gonna start with iced tea so we'll take 40 bags good English tea I like to make a lot of it and then report four cups of boiling water on top and just let that steep oke I'm just gonna set that aside okay now for the lemonade fresh lemons got to do it so the first thing I need is freshly squeezed lemon juice I need one cup depending on the size of the lemons about five or six lemons apparently at California this is a really popular drink the word has it that all the Palmer drinks them and so now everybody there drinks it [Applause] it smells delicious these are big lemons so I got one cup of lemon juice out of about four or five lemons next I need 3/4 of a cup of superfine sugar are you super fun because it dissolves better and four cups of water [Music] okay give it a stir I'm going to take the teabags out of the ice tea okay pour that in okay I think I'll slice a few lemon slices and put it in I was like when it looks like exactly what it is perfect I'm gonna chill it I'm gonna serve it over ice that should serve about six to eight people it could be delicious so while this chills I'm gonna cut up my shortbread cookie place cards and then I'm gonna make easy lobster paella I've been planning to ask the architects for lunch and when I went to a store and saw this cookie cutter in the shape of a hammer I thought that's perfect so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna roll out cookies and cut them in that shape and then put each person's name on it so they have a place card and a cookie to eat I'm just gonna roll the dough out I chilled it for about 30 minutes it just allows the dough to relax it's much easier to roll out I just want to keep the board flour I didn't want to roll out the cookies and then you can't get them off the board I'm rolling it out to between a quarter and a half inch thick okay so that should be just about the right thickness so I'm gonna cut out eight cookies seven for everybody and one just in case and how great is that I put them on the parchment paper so they don't stick to the pan [Music] you [Music] these are great cuz you really let the cut out cookies sitting there frigerator for a week and then bake them before you need them this is too much fun [Music] at 7 &amp; 8 I like to have a little bit of a shine on the cookies a little sprinkle of granulated sugar on the top does that cool okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 25 minutes into there ever so slightly browned and then later I'm gonna write everybody's name on them and then Miguel will have them for the table setting I love the smell of shortbread cookies those are gonna look great with people's names on them okay for lobster paella I'm gonna turn it up to 425 and I want to show you how I make really easy paella I actually used to avoid this because it was so complicated I thought why am I gonna bother making a big pot of things we have to cook everything individually so I decided I was gonna make it with lots of things I've already cooked and I'll show you how easy it is so first a quarter of a cup of oil and I'm gonna chop up some onions that wanted to have cups of onions so the first thing I did was I started on the cooktop but then I do most of the cooking in the oven so I'm not always standing over a hot pot and the second thing is instead of cooking each individual thing differently it has shrimp it has chicken it has sausage I decided I'm gonna use all things that are cooked like cook kielbasa cooked lobster I decide to make it really special I imagine pan was the classic Spanish dish where you used up all the leftovers okay no saute those for about five minutes meantime I'm gonna cut up some red peppers so in order to julienne peppers so they're really nice-looking I'm just gonna cut straight down and then save that later for snacks and then just julienne about half inch strips this is a great dish to make when you're serving a crowd it's great to make in large quantities and you don't have to serve it the minute it gets out of the oven okay how the onions doing they're just starting to get a little translucent and put the peppers in and let them cook for about five minutes just want to get the most flavor out of what you put in this is all gonna flavor the rice and then later I'm gonna add all competent
[Music] I'm going to make some time he has to go with coffee Tommy eggs are made with puff pastry and believe me if you had to make it yourself you would never make Tommy eggs but fortunately they can froze in the freezer department of your grocery store I'll show you what it is it's actually layers of dough and butter and it makes really really flaky cookies what you want to do is defrost it in the refrigerator so it stays really cold so I'm going to combine two cups of sugar and I know this is going to sound strange but an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and it really makes a difference in how it tastes so it's just like a big pinch of salt so I'll take a cup of sugar and for them you can do it on a board on a marble whatever you have just like that so you pull these guys apart it's folded in three I'm going to sprinkle the top with sugar stick rolling pin and just lightly roll it out just so the sugar adheres to the pastry okay now animalism just fold it kind of like folding a letter I'm going to fold it like that I'm going to fold it to the middle fold this to the middle and then fold it over itself just like that press it lightly and now I'm just going to slice it what's great is when they bake they're going to puff out and they're going to be all kind of swirled sort of like elephant ears or Tommy ace just like that just slice them about a half an inch thick you can really keep these in the freezer and if you want to bake off one or two with a cup of tea in the afternoon - not half bad and put these in a plastic bag and then they can be in a freezer until I need to bake them off so these guys came right out of the freezer and they can be baked frozen these are all covered in sugar so they'll be beautiful caramelized while they bake so there are only three of us so I don't think you need that many less few extras okay that's great so into the oven 450 degrees for about eight minutes and I'm going to turn them halfway through so they caramelize on both sides I can't thank you okay I'll wipe it on my jeans neck tomorrow darling Thank You incessant nobody is really rarely on the sugar so all my life it hasn't just it's just sweet it doesn't have any serve like a round flavor ever yeah it's good yeah and I help my secret is safe with you as long as were invited back you're invited back

[Music] okay so two tablespoons of freshly minced parsley I need about a half a cup of grated Parmesan cheese I think it's unusual and with meatballs but I think gives it lots of flavor [Music] one egg all these ingredients are designed to either flavor it or hold it together I'm just going to leave it a little bit pour it on top now some seasoning quarter of a teaspoon of nutmeg two teaspoons of salt half a teaspoon of pepper and here's the surprising part warm water 3/4 of a cup I shall learn this trick from Rao's that famous Italian restaurant in New York and it keeps the meatballs so moist you wouldn't believe in okay clean ham cooks best tool and you want to do this really lightly you don't want to sort of compact that you want to fluff it up and still mix them together it smells so good [Music] I'm just going to make my 15 really good seismic boss it's perfect for my guess [Music] I've got a quarter of inch of oil 1/2 olive oil and half vegetable oil since for the saute these and just keep turning them so they Brown evenly on all sides I'm doing them in two batches but I don't want to overcrowd them so they Brown nicely so the second batch of new salted gun comes from ten minutes people the nice and brown and then the finished cooking them in aitikaf okay I'm kind of poor up all the oil that I use for cooking the meat balls from the same pans got all that great flavor from in these walls scissors fresh on time once I'm up I'm in one or two onions depending on everything there's an eclipse of 10 minutes and so they're really tender and flavorful and now I need some wine for the sauce okay one and a half teaspoons of garlic I do the garlic at the end because it burns really quickly mmm you can smell the garlic immediately wonderful okay half a cup of red wine deglaze the pan get all those really crusty bits from the meatballs really flavors this off it cleans the pan so one 28-ounce can of tomatoes okay great that type of parsley learn a 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoons of pepper cook that together for a minute ok now what I'm going to do is take the meatballs and just put them right back into the sauce and they're going to cook for about 25 to 30 minutes [Music] we have to put them all in [Music] nice tomato sauce to you it's punch of basil right in the middle big spoon can't wait to see the faces
[Music] appearances the Paris attack yes [Music] so there are two secrets to make a really good omelet the first one is cook it over a very low flame so it doesn't get tough which they did and the second one is to undercook it just a little bit so it's really delicious and moist and I'd say they know how to make a good omelet they know how to make it almost on one approaches your omelet with the highest anyone like something like this at home maybe with baked eggs instead of online so that sounds delicious [Laughter] tell them to curb begged x4 differently watch how easy this is great so we mixed together a quarter of a teaspoon of fresh thyme right in this bowl quarter of teaspoon of fresh rosemary it's all kinds of French herbs want to use it judiciously because it's such a stronger and be sure that you chop it really well [Music] in both quarter teaspoon of fresh garlic this has all kinds of Provence all flavors in it one tablespoon of chopped parsley you can either use flat leaf or curly parsley kind of like a rough chop turns out to be too finely chopped 1 tablespoon of parsley and 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese just be sure to use good fresh Parmesan cheese okay so these are the gratin dishes that the eggs are going to go into and I'm going to crack 3 eggs into each Bowl 1 do it really carefully say don't break the yolks so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a little bit of butter put it in the gratin dish a little bit of cream just wrong what until they going to tray and it's a little piece of tough from the surface of the egg when I put these in the broiler for about three minutes so the fish gets really hot and the butter is nice and bubbly and then when it exits obstructive the comedian the creamy butter for the eggs I'll be done perfect it's nice and hot and bubbly I'm going to carefully slide the eggs into each one so don't break the yolk mmm just start to cook immediately the dish is really hot and then then put on my mixture of thyme garlic rosemary parsley and Parmesan I'll very Provence all salt and pepper into the broiler for about five minutes until it's hot and bubbly and delicious so that's very comfortable sitting there let's bring my French is fire flower you got it I had baked eggs the premises are lovely and then later the way the French have a salad after the meal I mean I have an andhis done with blue cheese and whole that is just delicious
[Music] since my husband Jeffrey is away during the week we try to make the most of our weekends one of his favorite things to do is go to the beach offseason so today I thought we take a nice long walk and then bringing hot soup and then we're going to come home for luxurious lunch with wine something tells me there's going to be an app to follow first I'll make French onion soup with grier croutons to take to the beach and the thermos when we get home there will be delicious goat cheese tart with garlic and herbs served with heirloom tomato and fennel salad and a lemony vinaigrette and for dessert an outrageous chocolate orange mousse and the best part is everything will be made in advance so when we get home there's nothing more difficult to do than get the sand out of our shoes okay my putting you in charge of some wine for long yeah that's okay hope you know what you get yeah okay great so happen upon me to the beach of an hour so okay okay then I'm gonna go finish lunch okay bye sweetie I hope it doesn't get creme de menthe but why do I think there's gonna be a cookie involved [Music] he's so adorable so I wanted to make a dessert for Jeffrey that he'd really love and he loves chocolate mousse I don't know any guy that doesn't so I'm gonna make a chocolate mousse with orange Grand Marnier and orange zest so first thing I want to do is melt six ounces of semi-sweet chocolate choose good chocolate just putting this in a double boiler you don't need a formal double boiler just any kind of a heat proof ball that can sit over simmering water is perfect and I'm all seven here's two ounces of bittersweet chocolate real chocolate lovers love bittersweet chocolate but I just think it's too bitter it's as sort of to me a little bit of a chalky taste so I like to combine the two so semi-sweet chocolate with a little bit of bitter gives it a sort of a round or flavor so that's the chocolate quarter of a cup of water this is my favorite ingredient quart of a cup of Grand Marnier which is orange liqueur because it's so much flavor mmm love the smell of that 1 teaspoon of good vanilla extract it's a really important flavor for chocolate and one teaspoon of grated orange zest which is gonna really heighten the orange flavor actually the orange is really interesting because the Grand Marnier makes the chocolate a little sweeter and the zest makes it a little bitter so it's kind of like adding the semi-sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate together so we'll just let this melt you gonna stir it a little bit then I'm going to turn off the heat let it cool a little bit and add the orange zest that make good chocolate most of that lots of eggs so the egg yolks go into the mixture and then the whites lighten it so I need eight eggs separated you know in France when you get chocolate mousse they very often serve a family-style they bring you a huge bowl of chocolate mousse and you're supposed to take one portion my husband Jeffrey didn't know that one time when he was very young and went to France on his own they brought him a huge bowl of chocolate mousse and he helped himself to some and then he thought I think I'll take a little more it was really good and then he had a little more and boy did he regret it the next day and I can imagine the proprietor thinking he ate the whole thing oops like a little egg yolk in here this is the way to get egg yolk out of egg whites take the shell and just dip it right in and you'll see the egg yolk goes right into the shell if you try and do it with a spoon it'll never work this is great the chocolates melted take it off the heat I'm just going to let that sit until it cools and then later I'll add the orange zest but first I'm going to beat the egg yolks and sugar okay eight egg yolks I have a cup of sugar so I'm gonna whip this for about four minutes until it's pale yellow and very dense and it sort of falls back on itself in a ribbon and now back to the profit that's a flavor to the chocolate one teaspoon of a grated orange zest and I need butter and it has to be room temperature butter this is why it's really important for the chocolate to be room temperature and the butter because I need to mix them in without the butter melted so one and a half sticks of butter remember this makes a lot of chocolate mousse gonna whisk these together just mix that in however you need to do with a spoon or a whisk just important that it's a creamy texture when it's done egg yolks are perfect if you lift the beater what falls back into the ball falls back in a perfect ribbon so it's really thick and light yellow perfect for the chocolate so we'll turn it on low and then add the chocolate this grace when you have Jefferies getting on at the wine shop hope you bring some a bottle of wine knowing Jeffery could come home with scotch look I'm in a high state attention here okay um ein is sent me for some wine only and I don't know what kind she wants I'm gonna rely on you sure okay what do you guys uh we're having a goat cheese tart no cheese thyme right so what do you suggest um you know what just let's do a simple good crispy Grigio uh 12 bucks great look it looks terrific yeah the great bottom line for the price okay are you really sure right I'm very sure okay time to finish the chocolate mousse so this is the chocolate semi-sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate orange zest and Grand Marnier and now I'm going to lighten it with egg whites and beaten cream this is one cup of egg whites tablespoon of sugar and a little bit of salt they're stiff but not firm and dry so just whisk this in lighten it I think I'm gonna have a very happy hubby loves chocolate mousse okay that's Whiston and you don't want to tap this out of the ball because anything that deflates the egg whites makes the chocolate mousse dancer don't want to do that and now just take the rest of it and just fold it in this is perfect folding technique if you take your rubber spatula and a dent right down in the middle and then fold it from the side and you'll deflate the egg whites as little as possible and really mix it in just keep turning the bowl and fold it in okay a little bit of whip cream give it the richness you can add cream to bowl that has egg whites in it but you can't do the reverse because the fat and the cream won't allow the egg whites to be so I did the egg whites first and now the cream so half a cup of cream take the spoon of sugar just whip that until it's dead cold cream lips better perfect so I'm just gonna fold the cream in you see really makes a difference just adds a little bit of richness which gives the chocolate much more flavor and again I'm gonna fold this in right down through the middle up through the side just folding it over until it's incorporated mmm I can smell the chocolate and orange together it's actually one of my favorite combinations to fill these little cups then later I'm going to decorate them with whipped cream in mandarin oranges who wouldn't want that for dessert [Music] oh thank you um I'd love one of these cookies they look so great [Music] I promised Jeffrey a nice romantic walk on the beach before lunch today but I don't know the weather report looks cold and rainy so I thought maybe I'd make some hot french onion soup and we'll go to the beach but maybe we'll eat it in the car so what I've done is I've sautéed that two and a half pounds of yellow onions and some butter and a bay leaf until they're really nice and caramelized and browned so now I'm getting to things some sherry and some cognac but half a cup of each and what that's gonna do is it's gonna deglaze the pan from the onions but it's also gonna add lots of great flavor half a cup of sherry it's medium dry sherry you don't want too sweet sherry because you want sweet onions and half a cup of cognac you can also use brandy cognac is brandy from the cognac region of France and just let that cook for about five minutes get all those brown crusty bits off the pan let the flavors get into the onions so one and a half cups of a dry white wine it's a Chardonnay which is really good this is just gonna cook for about 15 minutes in the meantime I think I'll make a goat cheese tart while Geoffrey's away I wonder what he's up to oh this looks great but if I have a bite of it I'm I'm gonna ruin my appetite maybe I just have a little bit just a little [Music] this is goat cheese I need an 11 ounce piece I chose the Leatherman half ounces and it usually comes in this size package sometimes called Montrachet and I get it with garlic and herbs I'm very creamy there's a lot of flavor and it's wonderful for this tart so when do to make the filling just put 11 a half ounces of garlic and herb goat cheese 1 cup of cream 3 eggs pour of a cup of fresh basil about 1/4 teaspoon of salt eighth of a teaspoon of pepper you puree [Music] I've already typed a tart shell and I sauteed some shallots a little bit of butter in a whale and put that on the bottom I'm gonna pour the filling over gorgeous is thick right so it's gonna bake 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until it begins to set the way custard would it's gonna be really good for lunch so French onion soup last thing I want to do is put in four cups of chicken stock and four cups of beef stock now I make chicken stock myself and I buy beef stock in a cam you can do whatever you like but it really makes a different step good stock just mix that together it's beginning to look like French onion soup tablespoon of salt depending on how salty the stocks are half a teaspoon of pepper you can use white pepper black pepper but I really prefer black just stir it around [Music] so we let that simmer away for about 20 minutes all the flavors are just going to be wonderful and while that happens I think I'll make tomato and fennel salad and then I'll make Geoffrey of the beach with French onion soup you have to have croutons so since we're taking it to the beach I thought I'd make them separately and we'll have those crackers so what I did is I just took slices of French bread olive oil salt and pepper and then shredded Gruyere on the top and baked it for a few minutes until it's nice and crisp and they're gonna be delicious with a French onion soup and I think the goat cheese tart smells like it's ready [Music] how pretty is that so let that cool it's best served at room temperature and now I'm gonna make a tomato and fennel salad so with the goat cheese tart I thought it'd be really nice to have tomato in fennel salad I'm gonna make it with a lemon vinaigrette this is fennel I love it it has an anise flavor and this is the bulb of the fennel and this is the fronds and I'm gonna use both of them in the salad so just take the fronds off and reserve them for later it's cut they look like deal and then just cut off the stalks don't really want to eat them they're very tough and you left with the bulb so just take the bowl cut it in half cut out the little core I sometimes make this with an orange vinaigrette but today I pop fennel and lemon would be perfectly great I'm just gonna slice this very thinly across fennel has a fairly strong flavor when it's raw when it's cooked it's just wonderful okay so that's the fennel these are great heirloom tomatoes there are they come in all different colors and flavors with a dish this simple you want to be sure that you're using really good ingredients just Tomatoes fennel and a little vinaigrette [Music] be sure you don't put tomatoes in the refrigerator they're really best when they left at room temperature and then I have these wonderful little cherry tomatoes all different colors I would have the small ones and quarter the bigger ones okay that should do it and then I'm going to take the fennel and just stir them across the top of it now I'm gonna make a vinaigrette two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice [Applause] two tablespoons of good olive oil one tablespoon of cider vinegar it will sweep salt [Music] just whisk it together I just pour it right on top [Music] and then just as a Cornish who's going to take these fennel fronds just chop them up let's can just sit at room temperature it's gonna be delicious with a goat cheese tart hmm French onion soup looks great just gorgeous so this is the thermos so we can take it to the beach it's a messy job but worthwhile our croutons isn't cold like little bags with soot on each of us three are croutons two mugs thermos of French onion soup and I'm off to the beach that looks great okay that's enough is it cold enough for you at the beach but accrue time to go at it cool we got a four-course meal here thank you oh great soup bed huh put your French onion soup visit sure I think we should go for walk on the beach before it gets even colder this sounds like a good idea let's go I'm gonna finish this chocolate mousse I love to decorate something with the ingredients that are in it so you know exactly what it is so I'm going to decorate with whipped cream and a little bit of orange this is just casual heavy cream a little bit of sugar - in vanilla high-speed that's it usually what I do is pipe it on with a pastry tube but you know I think this should just be casual just a dollop ream a mandarin orange it's simple it's delicious he's gonna be very handsome and will have a lot more for later if anybody comes to visit and two for Jeffrey and me just getting everything ready for lunch so the first thing I have is the goat cheese tart hope it's good [Music] I can smell the goat cheese and the garlic and arms [Music] and the tomato and fennel salad level of flavors in this lemon and fennel tomatoes perfect [Music] okay some bread and chocolate mousse [Music] a little white wine nice Pinot Grigio it's a nice nap and the best thing is Jeffrey's gonna think I'm really smart that I can get lunch ready five minutes after the beach only will know the truth leaf until they're really nice and caramelized and browned so now I'm gonna to think some sherry and some kind yak about half a cup of each and what that's gonna do is it's gonna deglaze the pan from the onions but it's also gonna add lots of great flavor half a cup of sherry its medium dry sherry you don't want too sweet sherry because I don't want sweet onions and half a cup of cognac you can also use brandy cognac is brandy from the cognac region of France and just let that cook for about five minutes get all those brown crusty bits off the pan let the flavors get into the onions so why don't have cups of a dry white wine it's a Chardonnay which is really good this is just gonna cook for about 15 minutes in the meantime I think I make a goat cheese tart while Jeffrey's away I wonder what he's up to oh this looks great but if I have a bite of it I'm I'm gonna ruin my appetite maybe I just have a little bit just a little [Music] this is goat cheese I need an 11 ounce piece actually it's 11 1/2 ounces and it usually comes in this size package sometimes called Montrachet and I'd our croutons isn't cold and like little bags with soot on each of us three are croutons two mugs thermos of

tart smells like it's ready [Music] pretty is that so let that cool it's best served at room temperature and now I'm going to make a tomato and fennel salad [Music] so with the goat cheese tart I thought it'd be really nice to have a tomato on fennel salad I'm gonna make it with a lemon vinaigrette this is fennel I love it it has an anise flavor and this is the bulb of the fennel and this is the fronds and I'm gonna use both of them in the salad so just take the fronds off and reserve them for later it's cut they look like deal and then just cut off the stalks don't really want to eat them they're very tough and you left with the bulb so just take the bowl cut it in half cut out the little core sometimes make this with an orange vinaigrette but today I felt fennel and lemon would be perfectly great I'm just gonna slice this very thinly across fennel has a fairly strong flavor when it's raw when it's cooked it's just wonderful okay so that's the fennel it doesn't so I'm gonna make a chocolate mousse with orange with Grand Marnier and orange zest the first thing I want to do is melt 6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate choose good chocolate just putting this in a double boiler

that make good chocolate most of that lots of eggs so the egg yolks go into the mixture and then the whites lighten it so I need eight eggs separated you know in France when you get chocolate mousse they very often serve a family style they bring you a huge bowl of chocolate mousse and you're supposed to take one portion my husband Jeffrey didn't know that one time when he was very young and went to France on his own they brought him a huge bowl of chocolate mousse and he helped himself to some and then he thought I think I'll take a little more it was really good and then he had a little more and boy did he regret it the next day and I can imagine the proprietor thinking he ate the whole thing oops like a little egg yolk in here this is the way to get egg yolk out of egg whites take the shell and just dip it right in and you'll see the egg yolk goes right into the shell if you try and do it with a spoon it'll never work this is great chocolates melted take it off the heat I'm just gonna let that sit until it cools and then later I'll add the orange zest but first I'm gonna beat the egg yolks and sugar okay and egg yolks I have a cup of sugar so I'm gonna whip this for about four minutes until it's pale yellow and very dense and it sort of falls back on itself in a ribbon and now back to the chocolate that's a flavor to the chocolate one teaspoon of the grated orange zest and I need butter and it has to be room temperature butter this is why it's really worth half a cup of sherry it's medium dry sherry you don't want too sweet sherry because I don't want sweet onions and half a cup of cognac you can also use brandy Tanaka's brandy from the cognac region of France and just let that cook for about five minutes get all those brown crusty bits off the pan let the flavors get into the onions so one and a half cups of a dry white wine it's a Chardonnay which is really good this is just gonna cook for about 15 minutes in the meantime I think I'll make a goat cheese tart while Geoffrey's away I wonder what he's up to [Applause] oh this looks great but if I have a bite of it I'm I'm gonna ruin my appetite maybe I just have a little bit just a little [Music] this is goat cheese I need an 11 ounce piece actually stiletto 1/2 ounces and it usually comes in this size package sometimes call Montrachet and I get it with garlic and herbs I'm very creamy there's a lot of flavor and it's wonderful for this tart so mundu to make the filling just put 11 1/2 ounces of garlic and herb goat cheese 1 cup of cream 3 eggs pour of a cup of fresh basil about 1/4 teaspoon of salt eighth of a teaspoon of pepper OOP you're right [Music] I've already been to tart shell and I saw tape some shallots a little bit of butter in oil I'm gonna put that on the bottom I'm gonna pour the filling over scourge isn't sick right so it's gonna bake 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until it begins to set the way custard would it's gonna be really good for lunch so French onion soup last thing I want to do is put in 4 cups of chicken stock and four cups of beef stock I make chicken stock myself and I buy beef stock in a cam you can do whatever you like but it really makes a different step good stock just mix that together it's beginning to look like French bean soup tablespoon of salt depending on how salty the stocks are half a teaspoon of pepper you can use white pepper black pepper but I really prefer black just stir it around so let that simmer away for about twenty minutes all the flavors are just gonna be wonderful and while that happens I think I'll make tomato and fennel salad then I'll make Geoffrey of the beach with French onion soup you have to have croutons so since we're taking it to the beach I thought I'd make them separately and we'll have these crackers so what I did is I just took slices of French bread olive oil salt and pepper and then shredded Gruyere on the top and baked it for a few minutes until it's nice and crisp and they're gonna be delicious with a French onion soup and I think the goat cheese tart smells like it's ready [Music] pretty is that so let that cool it's best served at room temperature and now I'm gonna make a tomato and fennel salad [Music] so with the goat cheese turn I thought it'd be really nice to have a tomato in fennel salad I'm gonna make it with a lemon vinaigrette this is fennel I love it it has an anise flavor and this is the bulb of the fennel and this is the fronds and I'm going to use both of them in the salad so just take the fronds off and reserve them for later it's cut they look like deal and then just cut off the stalks don't really want to eat them they're very tough and you left with the ball so just take the bulb cut it in half cut out the little core I sometimes make this with an orange vinaigrette but today I thought the fennel and lemon would be perfectly great I'm just gonna slice this very thinly across then I was a fairly strong favori when it's raw when it's cooked it's just wonderful okay so that's the fennel these are great heirloom tomatoes they're all they come in all different colors and flavors and for the chocolate to be room temperature and the butter because I need to mix them in without the butter melting so one and a half sticks of butter remember this makes a lot of chocolate mousse whisk these together just mix that in however you need to do with a spoon or a whisk just important that it's a creamy texture when it's done egg yolks are perfect if you lift the beater what falls back into the ball falls back in a perfect ribbon so it's really thick and light yellow perfect for the chocolate so we'll turn it on low and then add the chocolate this grace when you have Jefferies getting on at the wine shop hoping brings home a bottle of wine knowing Geoffrey could come home with scotch look I'm in a high state attention here okay um I know sent me for some wine oh boy and I don't know what kind you want so I'm gonna rely on you sure okay what do you guys uh we're having a goat cheese tart dough cheese tongue right so what do you suggest um you know what just let's do a simple good crispy Grigio so twelve bucks great look it looks terrific yeah it's a great ball the line for the price okay are you really sure right I'm very sure okay time to finish the chocolate mousse so this is a chocolate semi-sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate orange zest and Grand Marnier and now I'm going to lighten it with egg whites and beaten cream this is one cup of egg whites tablespoon of sugar and a little bit of salt they're stiff but not firm and dry so just whisk this in lighten it I think I'm gonna have a very happy hubby loves chocolate mousse okay that's Whiston and you don't want to tap this out of the ball because anything that deflates the egg whites makes the chocolate mousse dancer don't want to do that and now just take the rest of it and just fold it in this is perfect folding technique if you take your rubber spatula and go down right down in the middle and then fold it from the side and you'll deflate the egg whites a little as possible and really mix it in just keep turning the bowl and fold it in okay a little bit of whip cream give it two richness you can add cream to bowl that has egg whites in it but you can't do the reverse because the fat and the cream won't allow the egg whites to beat so I did the egg whites first and now the cream so half a cup of cream take a spoon of sugar just whip that until it's dead cold cream lips better perfect so just got full the cream in you see really makes a difference just adds a little bit of richness which gives the chocolate much more flavor and again I'm going to fold this in right down through the middle up through the side just folding it over until it's incorporated and I can smell the chocolate and orange together it's actually one of my favorite combinations let's fill these little cups then later I'm going to decorate them with whipped cream and mandarin oranges who wouldn't want that for dessert [Music] thank you um I'd love one of these cookies they look so great [Music] I promised Jeffrey a nice romantic walk on the beach before lunch today but I don't know the weather report looks cold and rainy so I thought maybe I'd make some hot french onion soup and we'll go to the beach but maybe we'll eat it in the car so what I've done is I've sautéed that two and a half pounds of yellow onions and some butter and a bay leaf until they're really nice and caramelized and browned so now I'm gonna add two things some sherry and some kind yak but half a cup of each and what that's gonna do is it's gonna deglaze the pan from the onions but it's also gonna add lots of great flavor with the dish this simple you want to be sure that you're using really good ingredients just tomatoes fennel and a little vinaigrette [Music] be sure you're not put Tomatoes in the refrigerator they're really best when they left at room temperature and then I have these wonderful little cherry tomatoes all different colors I would have the small ones and quarter the bigger ones okay that should do it and then I'm going to take the fennel and just strewn across the top of it now I'm gonna make a vinaigrette two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice [Applause] two tablespoons of good olive oil one tablespoon of cider vinegar it was sweet salt ever just whisk it together I just pour it right on top [Music] and then just as a Cornish who's gonna take these fennel fronds just chop them up let's can just sit at room temperature that's gonna be delicious with a goat cheese tart hmm French onion soup looks great just gorgeous so isn't the thermos so we can take it to the beach it's a messy job but worthwhile our croutons isn't cold like little bags of soot on each of us three are croutons two mugs thermos of French onion soup and I'm off to the beach that looks great okay that's enough is it cold enough for you at the beach but a crew time to go in that room and we got a four-course meal yeah so thank you oh great soup bed huh what's real French onion soup isn't it sure it I think we should go for a walk on the beach before it gets even colder it sounds like a good idea let's go I'm gonna finish this chocolate mousse I love to decorate something with the ingredients that are in it so you know exactly what it is so I'm going to decorate with whipped cream and a little bit of orange this is just casual heavy cream a little bit of sugar - and vanilla high-speed that's it usually what I do is pipe it on with a pastry tube but you know I think this should just be casual just a dollop ream a mandarin orange it's simple it's delicious he's gonna be various and we'll have a lot more for later if anybody comes to visit and two for Jeffrey and me just getting everything ready for lunch the first thing I have is the goat cheese tart just hope it's good [Music] I can smell the goat cheese in the garlic in arms [Music] and the tomato and fennel salad level of flavors in this lemon and fennel Tomatoes perfect [Music] okay some bread and chocolate mousse [Music] a little white wine I spin Alicia it's a nice napkins and the best thing is Jackie's gonna think I'm really smart that I can get lunch ready five minutes after the beach only will know the truth leaf until they're really nice and caramelized and browned so now I'm gonna two things some sherry and some cognac but half a cup of each and what that's gonna do is it's gonna deglaze the pan from the onions but it's also gonna add lots of great flavor half a cup of sherry it's medium dry sherry you don't want too sweet sherry because you want sweet onions and half a cup of cognac you can also use brandy Tanaka's brandy from the cognac region of France and just let that cook for about five minutes get all those brown crusty bits off the pan let the flavors get into the onions so why don't have cups of a dry white wine it's a Chardonnay which is really good this is just gonna cook for about 15 minutes in the meantime I think I'll make a goat cheese tart while Geoffrey's away I wonder what he's up to oh this looks great but if I have a bite of it I'm I'm gonna ruin my appetite maybe I just have a little bit just a little [Music] this is goat cheese I need an 11 ounce piece actually it's 11 1/2 ounces and it usually comes in this size package sometimes called Montrachet and I thought our croutons isn't cold they're like little bags with two times each of us three are croutons two mugs thermos of French onion soup and I'm off to the beach that looks great okay that's enough is it cold enough for you at the beach but a crew time to go with it no we got a four-course meal yeah like it oh great soup huh what's wrong French onion soup isn't it sure I think we should go for a walk on the beach before it gets even colder this sounds like a good idea let's go I'm gonna finish the chocolate mousse I love to decorate something with the ingredients that are in it so you know exactly what it is so I'm gonna decorate it with whipped cream and a little bit of orange this is just casual heavy cream pepper and then shredded Gruyere on the top and baked it for a few minutes until it's nice and crisp and they're gonna be delicious with a French onion soup and I think the goat cheese tart smells like it's ready pretty is that so I'm gonna let that cool it's best served at room temperature and now I'm gonna make a tomato and fennel salad [Music] so with the goat cheese tart I thought it'd be really nice to have a tomato on fennel salad I'm gonna make it with a lemon vinaigrette this is fennel I love it it has an anise flavor and this is the bulb of the fennel and this is the fronds and I'm going to use both of them in the salad so just take the front ones off and reserve them for later it's cut they look like deal and then just cut off the stalks don't really want to eat them they're very tough and you left with the bulb so just take the bulb cut it in half cut out the little core I sometimes make this with an orange vinaigrette but today I thought the fennel and lemon would be perfectly great I'm just gonna slice this very thinly across then was a fairly strong favour when it's raw when it's cooked it's just wonderful okay so that's the fennel it doesn't so I'm gonna make a chocolate mousse with orange Grand Marnier and orange zest the first thing I want to do is melt 6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate choose good chocolate just putting this in a double boiler you don't need a formal double boiler just any kind of a heat proof ball that can sit over
[Music] when the sun's out the last place I want to be is in the kitchen I'd love to jump in the car put the top down drive around and let local ingredients inspire my menu I stopped at a specialty food store and buy something I can serve as is I have a friend coming for lunch Jeffrey's coming for dinner and I'm gonna be cool and relaxed when they arrive on the menu shrimp linguini a delicious dish of shrimp and lemon with parsley and garlic for dessert store-bought meringues and raspberries with deceased whipped cream and then Jeff would be home just in time for a moonlit snack in the garden they'll get to sample the winner of my little cocktail contest the contenders are classic Manhattan a mai tai and the unbelievably strong Long Island iced tea and then we'll have his favorite smoked salmon spread with toasted baguette followed by fresh peaches and sputtering I think you'll love it perfect summer food [Music] Jeffery's is coming for a short time this weekend so I want to make every minute count so I'm gonna make a few things ahead and in addition to that I'm having a party tomorrow so I really want to have everything done so I can be out of the kitchen I'm gonna make smoked Salmons bread and peaches and Sauternes it's gonna be delicious since it only has two ingredients peaches and Saturn you want to make sure they're both really good and the only way to tell whether peach is good is if it smells like a peach I'm gonna dunk them in boiling water just to take the skins off what you don't want to do is go to the store and squeeze it because wherever you squeeze that you're gonna leave a brown spot so depending on how soft the peaches are it's gonna take between 30 seconds and maybe two minutes for the skins to come off easily and the only way to know is just try one okay they should be done now just test it put it nice water and then just see the peel comes right off what you don't want to do is cook the peaches so we're gonna take them all out now okay this one's peeling beautifully see how the skin just sort of falls right off when it's right [Music] look at that one can see perfect okay [Music] okay smells so good it's our fresh summer piece now great so so I turn which is that sweet dessert wine that's so wonderful I'm just going to pour it over it so that's right enough so it marinates in it a little bit of sugar really depends on how sweet the pages are these are pretty sweet so I don't need too much and a splash of Grand Marnier just to give it a little depth of flavor so I'm gonna make a little snack for Jeffrey when he comes home tomorrow night smoked salmon spread and then we'll have some fresh peaches and Sauternes afterwards that's not a bad snack but the cream cheese out at room temperature I'm just gonna put it in the mixer eight ounces of cream cheese got a half a cup of sour cream this is great as a dip with crudité but it's also good as a spread on what slices of baguette and about a tablespoon of lemon juice freshly squeezed lemon juice and then from lots of flavor some fresh dill would be really nice and just chop it up big rough chop okay that tablespoon of fresh dill right into the mixer and a little bit of salt and pepper and teaspoon horseradish forget grating your own horseradish it makes me cry right into the mixer and finally smoked salmon can of smoked salmon dip with that smoked salmon I tend to like Ural region salmon because it's a little drier and not quite so salty okay four ounces of smoked salmon right into the dip turn the mixer on mix it up that's not salmon dip done and to a nice ball just because it's just a snack for Jeffrey doesn't mean it can't be gorgeous okay into the fridge I've got a really busy day tomorrow so I've got to get my beauty sleep [Music] my god it's always yeah berries from the Rings I think these raspberries gonna be perfect you're gonna put these on my charge I don't need a bag like that thanks so much good to see you [Music] shop with some amazing as always right now what I need is one bed gap for my smoked salmon spread all right nice and crack I know they're always nice and fresh hot out of the oven Oh fantastic and I need some meringues I'm gonna do whipped cream and berries in it okay hello of us yeah this is so good thank you so much will you charge it for me sure yes thank you it's gonna be delicious I'll call you for dinner soon thank you [Music] my philosophy is you don't always need to make something to have a fabulous dessert so I've gotten meringues from loaves and fishes and they just gorgeous the fresh raspberries from the farm stand I'm just gonna whip up a little whipped cream to fill them how bad can that be so I'm just gonna put some heavy cream in it ball and I've got the mixer fitted with a whisk attachment what really cold cream a little sugar everybody likes to flavor whipped cream with vanilla but I like to try different things like rub or this is cassis it's a currant liqueur and wait to see turns mole and the good news is you have to taste it to make sure it's the right combination it's so good it's like berry flavored whipped cream who wouldn't want that done so now I'm just gonna assemble them I love a combination of whipped cream because it's creamy and the meringues which are sort of dry and crisp top with really sweet berries was that for dessert that's pretty great isn't it I can't wait for dessert I think I hear the bell and Michael incredible for attempted florist these are everything look at these own a sweet person fabulous so are you in charge of arranging the flowers I'm in charge of flowers I'm making dinner fabulous you need anything buzz the nurse we're right in the kitchen I'm making linguine with shrimp scampi it's a great summer dish I can't oil the pasta pot so that the pasta doesn't stick together and salt for flavor okay that's gonna cook for seven to ten minutes according to the directions on the package so I'm making a set of these with hydrangeas I use a knife because a scissor will seal the stem and we want as much water in the flowers as possible [Music] okay that the three tablespoons of olive oil about three tablespoons of butter I do the olive oil because it is a high burning temperature and the butter because there's lots of flavor I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce of the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than the flavor of garlic so one minute while I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is a peeled and deveined shrimp bluefish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein it yourself I'm gonna add the pound of shrimp you just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor of the garlic is gonna get into the shrimp so first thing I do a salt and pepper the shrimp I'm going to have lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also it's a really strongly flavored just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides it's so good all that garlic and butter and oil how bad can that be Michaels so great with flowers I can't wait to see what he's doing at the table [Music] it looks good I hope Anna likes it so just rain from the drain the water from it and then it's gonna go right into that pan with the shrimp and the garlic and butter and oil it's gonna bizarre ball that great flavor okay just like that two spoons just toss it all together essentially great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and the sauce together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredient so lemon zest lemon juice I like a little bit of heat so just a sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and then have two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to you can't really see the lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people aren't gonna eat them but they'll they'll see that it's lemon so I'm gonna add a few slices of lemon to the whole thing before I finish it's tossing this really great summer lunch I think Michaels gonna [Music] [Music] we never customers who once is in at six o'clock in the morning yeah so that hurt houseguests feel and think that she has done all these flowers buyers so save room for dessert so it's meringue with whipped cream and fifties and fresh raspberries I mean how summary is that cheers every Friday night when Trevor comes home and make him a scotch and the roast chicken well it's time to shake things up a little bit I thought wouldn't it be great when he walks through the front door to have some cocktail for him so I'm gonna try three different cocktails first a Long Island iced tea and it has nothing to do with - okay so here goes ice cubes into the glass now the liquor lots of it all in the same quantity start with gin quarter of a cup quarter of a cup of vodka and a quarter of a cup of white rum and there's still more next a quarter of a cup of tequila and a quarter of a cup of Cointreau the orange flavored liqueur from France you don't want to drive after you drink this and you want to make sure you guess now how strong it is next time lemon juice 1/2 a cup and a teaspoon of sugar syrup give it a stir drop in some ice cubes in a long tall glass and then pour the Long Island iced tea over the rocks tap the glass with a splash of Cola and a slice of lemon on the rim can't wait to try it imagine this on a hot summer day okay so far so good my next experiment is a my time which is that summery cocktail you have in the Caribbean on vacation you know the one that's all loaded up with pineapples and maraschino cherries I do draw the line at those little paper umbrellas though okay here goes so lightly beaten egg white and pour it into a flat plate and then dip the rim of the glass in the egg and then into the sugar my ties make me feel like it's summer on a beach looks great already doesn't it okay the liquor white rum half a cup into the shaker next a quarter of a cup of triple sec it's another delicious orange flavored liqueur and then some fresh orange juice at a quarter of a cup and for the zing quarter of a cup of fresh lime juice now some ice cubes about six okay now the energetic part starts shaking and then pour the might I enjoy glass over ice and now the decoration it's a little old fashioned but it's required drop the cherries right into the cocktail then a juicy chunk of pineapple on the rim and some orange so there it is strictly for summer and very tropical I can't wait to taste it one more cocktail to go and it's a classic it's a Manhattan always reminds me of the roaring 20s it's made from bourbon and sweet vermouth how bad can that be okay so for the Manhattan start with the ice cubes next remove quarter of a cup and bourbon a whole Cup and give it all a stir so chill glasses make this perfect just chill them in the freezer for that 15 minutes and then a maraschino cherry the crowning glory no wonder people have been drinking this cocktail for more than 100 years now comes the fun part I have to taste these cocktails first minute hat looks great doesn't it [Music] whoa that's lethal Jeff you'll never make it through dinner if I serve him that hmm then the Long Island iced tea looks like iced tea actually tastes like iced tea which is amazing and the last one is a mai tai it actually really looks like the Caribbean isn't it that's it it's a really good it tastes like fruit juice it's a little more lethal than that but it's gonna feel like a vacation to Geoffrey and it's gonna be a great weekend [Music] we could do the sweet peas but I think is her color she never seems to find yeah that's nice that's nice what else have or if we can do the pinky oh yeah nice big arm yeah that sounds great the sliced has left over Baghdad and make croutons out of it to see what easy this is someone take the bread just line it up on a sheet pan a little bit of olive oil just a brush each one on the top with olive oil it's gonna Brown it and it gives it lots of flavor lots of salt you want to have really good flavor pepper and into the oven 400 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes I'm gonna have nice crisp baguette slices Geoffrey should be home any minute [Music] coffee machines I think that I think this is this is exactly what she would love oh these toys look great nice and crispy I've got lots of flavor wait I think I hear Geoffrey any sweetie I'm back oh you're gonna make me a person maybe later okay but right now come with me okay I brought look what I caught you have no idea how many drinks I had to try in order to get these mai tais it's a tough job but somebody has to do it I hope you like it hmmm delicious so what's in it [Music] so I also made just a little smoked salmon dip already fresh peaches and Saturn so what's in it smoked salmon sound a little girl few other things so why actually don't we the garden I don't know but you know every time if you bring this stuff here you'll be in the car [Laughter] [Music]
[Music] I live in East Hampton New York and my husband Jeffrey works in Connecticut so every Friday night he has to drive home and I love to have a roast chicken and a tiramisu waiting for him when he gets home the house smells like growth's chicken and hey who wouldn't want to come home to that tara misu incentive 90s wood pasta pesto west of the 80 it was done done and over done and we all stopped making it and in fact it's one of those really delicious and easy things to make someone make it today for my husband Jeffrey so I need six egg yolks if you want to really be squishy and messy about this it's the best way to separate eggs it's just do it in your hand and the whites fall right through your fingers and the yolk goes right into the bowl and it's gone I'm going to add a quarter of a cup of sugar and now I'm going to whisk these for about five minutes until they're really light and you'll see they change completely so while that's going I'm going to put the other ingredients together the first one is I need really good rum dark rum is so wonderful because it's got really great depth of flavor is it not that so I need a quarter of a cup of dark rum and a quarter of a cup of espresso and then the less ingredient I need is mascarpone I'll show you what it is this is a really lovely ingredient it's really Italian cream cheese it's very thick at the triple creme and it's so Restless in the dessert position well the eggs look done so I'll show you this is just the way they want to look it's light and when you hold it up it falls back on itself in a ribbon so now a medium speed I'm just going to add the combination of the espresso and the rung so I can smell the Roman espresso what it hits the egg that's wonderful I'm just going to add the mascarpone I would put it at 16 ounces of mascarpone it's either one large or two small containers so that's the cream mixture and now we're going to go to assembling it this is the secret to making really good cheer masu they're called Sol you already and you get them in the Italian specialty store or possibly even in the grocery store they're ladyfingers but unlike American ladyfingers they're really crisp they're graham they're wrong and what I'm going to do is dip them in a mixture of rum and coffee and then pour the cream over you Steve fantastic the key to the ladyfingers is if you dip them for too long they get very soggy if you dip them for too little time they're going to not absorb enough flavor so we'll just do it like this exactly that amount of time and then put it right into the dish and then the next one on one side on the other side and then lift it out so I'm going to have roast chicken for dinner which is really simple with all the vegetables all in one pan it's a one dish dinner and then I'm going to have the tiramisu as dessert so I've made two things and have the most elegant dinner and now I'm going to take this incredible delicious cream this is the mascarpone and eggs and rum and espresso and pour half of it right over the top of this like that and then we're going to do another layer of espresso rum soaked ladyfingers the good news about this is it's not rocket science all I'm doing basically is assembling this and I didn't have to cook a thing there's no standing the Govan going is it done is it not done and the last layer of cream just smooth it over the top and then just before I serve it I'm going to put shaved chocolate and sometimes a little bit of powdered sugar on the top so it goes in the fridge and it'll sit for about an hour or two but the good news is to consider for two days and you'll see it'll really set up it will be delicious [Music] 31 great saga videos don't bother them just they're also happy only thing you're going to notice triggers the trick thank you mister roast chicken I can do this in my sleep so I want to just check the chicken for any leftover pinfeathers and I'm going to Pat it dry on the outside and I do that so that when brush it with butter and salt and pepper it will stick to it all the giblets have been taken out and safe for another time so I'm just going to stand it up like this and just salt and pepper the inside chicken can sometimes be a little bland and so as much as I can do to give it lots of flavor I'm going to do so salt and pepper inside and then I'll show you my secret and all you need to do is just take this whole lemon cut it in quarters and just stuff it in the middle I'm going to take this entire head of garlic cut it right in half so you can see all that little clove when it's inside the chicken it's going to be just like the hint of garlic and it gets into the juices in the vegetables in the pan it's so delicious and then I some fresh thyme and just stuff it right inside this great chicken now all I have to do is brush of butter on the top salt and pepper and it's ready to go you want to melt the butter but not let it burn but it's actually better for this in olive oil the butter has some milk solids in it that burn a little bit so it makes the chicken nice and brown okay that's good so I'm going to brush the entire outside of this chicken gorgeous little chicken and then season it with salt and pepper I know it seems like a lot of salt but it's really important for the chicken have lots of flavor and that will do it and pepper okay this is gorgeous now the next thing I want to do is trust it which is sort of to tie it up so that it cooks evenly some point of trust saying is if it's little legs are out like this the legs can very easily get burnt the meat can get overcooked so what I want to do is pull it into its body so it cooks really well I'll just all I have to do is tie the legs together and we'll do that you'll see they're all these very complicated ways to trust a chicken but this is a bit as easy as a guess so once you take a length of kitchen twine and just tie these little legs together and I leave long in so it's easy to take the twine off nobody want to eat wine for dinner so just like that and then it's little wings just go under here just tuck them under the whole bird doesn't have to be wrapped in twine I've seen some birds that look like they're in bondage those chickens just the best kind of comfort food and the good news it can be a really simple meal or can be a really elegant one okay that's ready to go and I'm going to make some vegetables all right chicken is ready I love when there are vegetables in the bottom of the chicken and they just soak up all this delicious chicken juices so when I put carrots fennel and onions in the pan when I'm choosing carrots my experience is the top carrots and one of the green tops on them really have more flavor so I was trying to find them when I can so I'm just going to cut these in big chunks like that doesn't really matter how big the chunks are but I don't want them too small because as they cook they sort of shrink a little bit so just make sure they're big chunky because these are cooking for a while it really doesn't matter how how you cut them up you don't want them hugely different but though I'll cook about the same time so you'd be really rough about them I think it gives it a good country look and this is channel I love fennel and I'm going to take all the tops off fennel has this when it's raw not that crazy that it rather it has a very anise kind of flavor it's very sharp but when it's cooked it gets sweet and succulent and delicious so we're going to set this little guy up like this through the middle and sometimes I like to take the core out and then I'm just going to do it big long chunks like that so all these vegetables are going to be seasoned lightly chemically underneath the chicken and I'm going to put onions in later and it'll be just perfect I'm going to skip the bowl the vegetables right in here i season them right in can I just on the roasting pan that's just big enough to hold the chicken and the vegetables loosely but not huge roasting pan so the next thing is a drizzle of olive oil doesn't have to be exact just so that they get a little brown when the ground little salt little pepper I love the way this looks - salt fresh and I'm going to just toss it with olive oil my hands and next is the onions so onions I like to use a some Spanish onions they're much bigger and I figure about one Spanish onions every two regular onions so much as you feel that way there are all kinds of theories about how to stop crying when you peeling onions I haven't found a good one yet just do them quickly I've even tried ski goggles nothing really works let's toss them all together I actually have some time that I picked a few days ago when it's dried it's so much easier to get the leaves off the stems just like that sprinkle it over the top actually you can even just put the whole stem in and then take the stem out afterwards and now I'm going to take my chicken so all the juices from the chicken are going to get into the vegetables and we'll all cook together until be so delicious so into the oven 425 degrees for about an hour and a half of course I could buy herbs at the market but I think it's such a delicious pleasure to come out to the garden and pick fresh parsley when I need it not only don't I have to buy it but I get to go outside in the middle of cooking I come out barefoot in the grass and the Sun and I get to see all my flowers and parsley totally underappreciated and it's got great flavor just good I've lost Josh because I love to use chives and this is my second crop of basil for the summer I've already picked everything and they test don't clear the freezer whose love basil [Music] actually grows several different kinds of time they have little blue flowers in the spring and I just love the way the flowers look but also some of the variety stay green all winter so I can use it all winter and they all have different little lavender flowers so if I have a variety of them also gonna have lavender flowers on them it's all wonderful these are these these potatoes in the world I think I've made more garlic roasted potatoes and every other vegetable combined I start with red potatoes you can really use any kind of thin-skinned potato maybe about 2 pounds if they're big potatoes I'll cut them in quarters if they're small potatoes I'll cut them in half and you can just forget what your mother used to tell you about parboiling and peeling potatoes these work really well it's so much easier ok a little olive oil just drizzle it on coarse salt use kosher salt but you can use sea salt or any kind of stuff that have around lots of fresh pepper give it a little spice jab the secrets of my potatoes really good garlic I was trying to find garlic that's very firm like this doesn't have a big sprout on it you don't want to plant in your potatoes you want a really good garlic and years ago I was I was actually cooking with a very good friend of mine he's a wonderful cook and and I was peeling garlic of the way you would peel an onion and she said no no no what you want to do is hit it with your knife so I just like wound up and said oh no no no she goes you put your knife on the garlic and you go like that and look we have just perfect so I'm going to peel 6 cloves of garlic there's a lot of garlic in this meal but when you cook garlic for a long time it becomes really sweet so it's not going to be too garlicky meal and anyway both of you are eating it anyway I'll have to do is get the garlic in with potatoes into the oven tiramisu Jeffrey's gonna think I've worked all day and it's been really easy ok my chickens in the oven Scholz potatoes are almost ready to go chairman Susan their fridge it's great it's going to mince up the garlic doesn't have to be perfect now the easiest way I find a chopped garlic is to lead the tip of the blade on the board and run that's nice back and forth really let the blade do the work okay lots of garlic smells so good you use my hands I'll mix up the olive oil salt I've already put on at the pepper I'll check into the oven 400 degrees 30 minutes and if you only have one oven just doesn't both in the same temperature doesn't matter once potatoes crisp on the outside and really juicy inside and that worse chickens not so good looks perfectly done it's been in for about an hour and a half and lots of ways to tell the chicken is done and all those delicious juices coming out into the vegetables so the first test just can take this little string off so nobody ends up eating it first technical to shake hands with its leg if it wobbles like that it's perfect the second one is to cut between the leg and the thigh and just make sure the juices are running clear and if they are it's definitely done and so I'm just going to cover it with aluminum foil it's really important when you're roasting meats chicken beef anything to let it rest for about 20 minutes after she's out of the oven just going to keep it covered so it stays nice and warm and all the juices run back into the meat and it makes it so delicious and then I think I'll put those vegetables back in the air gonna let them caramelize a little bit while the chicken wrap [Music] so this looks fabulous all those gooey layers of mascarpone and ROM and espresso and cookies all soaking up the flavor tiramisu is traditionally finished with chocolate and I've got a big block of chocolate this is a bittersweet chocolate but you can really use anything you have in your pantry and I'm going to shave it with a vegetable peeler and what I'm going to do is just heat it up a little bit with my hand and then I'll get longer curls from shaving it this long curls just very relaxed and just sprinkle them on top they look fabulous and they've got two spresso rum and chocolate and the final thing if you have a little confectioners sugar around I like to put a little bit of confectioner sugar around the top I think it just gives it that perfect little finish strainer and just on the side back in the fridge and desserts all ready [Music] we've been resting for that 20 minutes perfect time to carve it so the trick to carving a chicken and I'm going to pull the leg off birth time that easiest so I usually take the legs off first but on my platter and depending on how big the legs of our I'll just carve them a little bit but not too much that's it served and then the wing comes off it's just so juicy inside it's just wonderful a friend of mine said the Chile a child how's that for a teacher showed her how to do this and it's really brilliant I've done it ever since take the entire breasts off in one piece and then slice it directly across like so every serving has a little bit of skin and a little bit of meat and it's frankly I think so much easier whole thing goes on the point when you cook a chicken at high temperature the skin is one of the best parts because it's nice and crisp and now the vegetables going to keep this for later for chicken stock I'm just going to mix it all together all those juices just over and all these carrots and fennel and onions and fresh thyme so I'm going to put it right on the platter with the chicken you can take the stems oh just smell so gorgeous I'm going to take all the juices of the vegetables and the chicken on the bottom and just run them all over the chicken really use everything in that pan just them it's maybe a little sprinkling of good kosher salt over the top who wouldn't want to be home for this do [Music] so leave the garlic roasted potatoes to make our seriously garlic throw crisp on the outside delicious inside it's like a tired kitchen hydrating a little bit good right would you move to my dream is what you've been dreaming up all the way home I loved one and be fabulous and it's sprinkling of parsley on the top how much a week oh it was it was for a celebration that's a better grieving life so I've been cooking away all day and how there is one I need a glass of wine will you feel like your invitation well I'd like to put them over have you never will be and excited some two movies wow that looks wonderful you know usually I put the potatoes into the chicken I don't know but I treat you with that I love those potatoes smells wonderful much fungus smell run up to a window it yeah we have to feel lucky that's just a feel of us to go isn't it is specifc was actually in Pacific ROM and espresso also pony wanted everybody nyla you know obviously breaking the law [Music] everyone has their obsession summer minutes got me and any chicken carcasses [Music]
[Music] my friend TR is incredibly good-looking he's got lots of style needs a little bit of help in the food department so I promised to put together party with him for his friend that will really knock their socks off and I'm gonna share with him my five rules of entertaining hey what are friends for so what I thought we'd do is roasted eggplant spread for when everybody arrives and then for dinner a baked Virginia ham and a big platter of roasted winter vegetables and then for dessert I'm gonna give them a lemon cake from my freezer that's really easy and I'm gonna make lemon curd form so I can pour it over the lemon cake I think it's gonna be really easy for him and his friends are gonna be very impressed okay that's good I'm gonna do it really easily by putting in a food processor with one and a half cups of sugar I'll show you how instead of zesting all these lemons this is a really easy way to do it okay I'm just gonna chop it up really finely in here so I want to make sure the lemon zest is really finely pureed into the sugar just a little bit more you can tell it someone can really smell the lemon oil so that's good okay so I'm gonna put into the mixer a quarter of a pound of butter want it to be room temperature so it's easy to mix so next thing is this wonderful lemon sugar that I've just made it smells great I'm just gonna mix look the butter and sugar mix them together and then with a mixer on low speed I'm gonna add four extra-large eggs one at a time well maybe two at a time the pinch of salt and the last thing is 1/2 a cup of lemon juice great and now I'm just gonna cook it together for like about ten minutes until it gets nice and thick okay I'm just gonna put this on the really low flame for about ten minutes it looks really curdled when it's going in but don't worry it's gonna get very smooth when it cooks so low heat and you don't ever want it to boil otherwise the eggs actually will cook and you'll have lemon scrambled eggs not a good idea [Music] thank you for doing this I'm so happy to do it I needed a little help yeah well you've come to the right place good so get yourself relaxed so I'm making lemon curd for you dessert first absolutely deserve it so we're celebrating your new house that's exciting yeah finally after what how many months of renovations it's really worth it yeah you can even start mmm first rule of entertaining make it really easy the best parties are the ones where the host and hostess are having fun so I really about make very relaxed and having a really good time okay into the fridge right the next rule of Entertainer is making in advance so we're gonna make a roasted eggplant dip choose your weapon first things an eggplant like a medium eggplant you want to cut that in half and I see it's an easy thing is you don't even have it feeling just cut it really up and then maybe right down the middle just like that you know the peeler everything don't even have to peel it and that great right so the next thing is our two red peppers I'll show you a really easy way to do the peppers just run your knife right down side just like oh that's a great idea that it's like two of excellent yeah exactly okay now we need one red onion and then just cut it across there's a wall up and right on the top put it right on top there okay you don't feel garlic really hmm I think I cut off the end kind of like the onion you keep that right maybe take the whole corrode snap just chop it up you know sort of rough chop it's all gonna cook together what we need is some olive oil [Music] salt and pepper you in charge of salt and petrol lots of it I don't how much vegetables really need yeah freshly ground pepper so what how does this what are we doing so what's gonna happens we cook it and the vegetables are get really tender and soft right and then we're gonna put in a food processor and make a really chunky spread out of it with a little bit of tomato paste you'd be surprised how good it is yeah and you're gonna serve it with like feta and olives and some chips to dip how's that sound that's how Spencer how easy is that right alright you're gonna do the messy hand things together yeah this is the fun part it's great perfect I'd say that looks fabulous oh okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 45 minutes until all the vegetables are really tender and delicious and then we'll make the roasted eggplant for it so you've got rule number one is make it really easy rule number two is making an advance and next I'm going to tell you vegetables we smells great the onions and the red peppers okay you want to get the tomato paste or we can finish the roasted eggplant spread so this is the third tip got tomato paste the third tip now I'm not telling you yet so you want to put that what you call this and I'll scoop them in oh cool just use this I can really smell it you can see it's wonderful I love the red onions I think they're really sweeter okay and you try and get all of them in not on the food processor so the next thing is a tablespoon of tomato paste okay so now you're just gonna pulse it a few times so it's you want a really coarse keep going keep going until it's all trucked up that looks perfect okay so yeah I don't anything would be great to serve this with is if you get feta yeah but it right now feta and olives and maybe some chips I think it'd be really great with that what kind of chips like those yellow corn chips would be great it's kind of scoop it you're gonna help with the shopping list right that's the third tip uh-huh is you want to buy as much as you can and just make a few things so I'll help you with a shopping list you want to put that much yes refrigerator and I think it's a gorgeous day we need to do this in the garden so it's come with me [Laughter] [Music] by everything that you can buy no it's really important to just make a few things and shop for everything else your friends won't have more fun if you spent days making this party so alright so you have eggplant spread roasted eggplant right and you're gonna get feta tripe and some olives to go with it what kind of olives I don't know what do you like like kalamata olives those Greek olives or I sometimes like those oil-cured olives with their to prove all their wrinkly ones their wrinkly chips chips yeah chips would be good to scoop them yeah and then this is what I was thinking about for dinner and I thought maybe a big Virginia ham with a glaze like with mustard it's so easy won't believe it and then maybe some roasted winter vegetables you're like butternut squash and carrots and what else would be good sweet potatoes and I'm gonna do parsnips which are like carrots but they're white and they have sort of a carrot like flavor they're really good dessert we did the curd we did the lemon curd and I'm gonna give you the lemon cakes in the freezer and strawberries right servers are great that'd be really nice and I'm gonna make the ham glaze yeah thank you so much okay everybody I will see you okay after your chopping okay bye sweetie I know I have to make the ham glaze but maybe just a minute and this son as much as I'd like to lie around in the garden all day I did promise to you I'd help him with dinner so what I'm gonna do is a spiral cut ham with a glaze that has mustard and chutney it's just wonderful so the first thing is I'm making the glaze is six cloves of garlic right into the food processor the next thing is eight and a half ounces of mango chutney really can use any kind that you can find half a cup of Dijon mustard now these measurements aren't exact if you like mustard you want a little more use it if you want a little less garlic use less and one cup of brown sugar I use light brown sugar but if dark brown sugar works for you it's fine too and orange zest and orange juice my handy dandy zester whenever I use juice I always try and use the zest because frankly I think it has more flavor [Music] hey ready how are you good have you got that out that's my little sake you know oh thank you very much joy have a good one you too [Music] [Music] so just period it until it was really smooth and then when I get to TRS house I'm going to pour it on the ham and bake it off a big brown and crusty and delicious [Music] great black olives [Music] so entertaining rule number four make food that's really familiar and comforting makes people feel great this isn't the time to try and show off and impress your friends with lots of fancy things I like to make things that are just warm and familiar and make people feel really good so in that vein I'm making roasted winter vegetables forty are the key to roasting vegetables as you want to make sure you have big chunks of vegetables because when they roast they sort of shrink down a little bit so I have lots of carrots and we'll mix them all on the sheet pan together this is a butternut squash it's one of my favorite vegetables it's sort of tough you'll see on the inside and what I've done is I've peeled it just like that all the way around and then cut it in half and cut out the seeds and then chopped it in big cubes so I've already got one done which is all I need so that's gonna go right on the sheet pan with the carrots okay the next thing is sweet potatoes somehow sweet potatoes and yams always get confused but what you find here is always sweet potatoes yams are more of a yellow and a little sort of starch here and the next thing is parsnips so if you haven't seen it parsnip this is it looks like a carrot it's not orange obviously it's white but it's really I just think they're really delicious and they're sort of sweet the way carrots are sweet so you can cut them in in half like that in big dices but I've got it already peeled and diced so it's just gonna go on the sheet pan how easy is that just cutting and chopping and now what are we would you I'll get them ready for TR to roast in the oven by pouring olive oil lots of salt remember vegetables really use up the salt say you want make sure it's well seasoned and freshly ground pepper right on top it's a really simple vegetable because there's so many different kinds it's also really flavorful okay and then I'm just gonna toss them together with my hands Sotiris just gonna put this in the oven with a big Virginia ham and I say his friends are gonna be really impressed and I'm the only one that's gonna know how easy it was [Music] [Music] I'm great so how's the shopping successful yeah easy we lucky I do yeah fantastic put the ham in the fridge great I love your pool I'll be swimming in that pool may have to call the police to get me out of here that's huge oh my god you'll be having ham sandwiches for a long time but it's gonna be really good so you won't mind put the ham and the ham in the pan no just that side all right it's perfect actually this is great look how fabulous this is it's already sliced you can see its spiral cut so when you're ready to serve it it's all ready to go isn't it great yeah you just peel each slice right off like but for an hour I could take a card that's it for now we're just gonna pour the I need a spatula all right so what's in the glass the glaze has mustard and honey and chutney and garlic it's so good and you know the hams already cooked it's actually smoked so you just have to make sure it's heated through and then the top is gonna be really brown and crusty really good okay I already smell did you preheat the oven to 350 yes ma'am all right my guy okay into the oven oh my god really heavy 350 for an hour and it's gonna be glazed and gorgeous and delicious so I can open the oven door [Music] next is Rusted winter vegetables that looks great usually I roast them at a high temperature like 425 for about 25 or 30 minutes but since you have one oven and the ham is in there 350 you're gonna roast it at 350 for 45 minutes and they'll be perfect okay so you wanna pop in the oven okay perfect and then I'll show you what else I brought roasted eggplant spread remember we made this yeah not so long ago actually the good thing is you can really make it a few days in advance so so just put it in the dish we only have dessert left right one of my favorite things I'm gonna take a big dollop of lemon curd and put it right on the plate okay great I'm just put the strawberries in the ball okay everything's all ready I feel confident it looks gorgeous great thank you which leads me to rule number five yeah a really good look at the back before your guests arrive thank you so much it was really fun I love you back here [Music] to get numb me so now it happens dim with us is its roasted eggplant spread and now it's eggplant red peppers olive oil garlic onions it's delicious and you made this it's really easy TR this is too good you have to get another house next week's please okay who would like some of my homemade lemon cake that is slaving away all afternoon got here's

can't believe you told them he's so adorable I believe anything he told me
[Music] when I finished my first cookbook I thought I'll never have another idea for a cookbook and I'll never be able to write another recipe well I just finished my fifth cookbook and I feel like celebrating so I've invited some of my dear friends over and I'm making them dinner from recipes in the new book I'm making grilled marinated lamb kabobs with a lemon rosemary sauce I think I'll have my friends help with the grill with an easy Mediterranean tomato and feta salad plus lots of treats from the store home is drizzled with olive oil and toasted pignoli Plus mixed olives and grilled pita bread and for dessert a lighter than air but decadent black and white angel food cake my friend Miguel is coming to help me with the food table this is gonna be a real celebration so it's such a gorgeous day today I thought it'd be really fun to do things that we can cook outside then I'll actually get my friends to do the grilling so for the lamb kebabs I actually chose very interesting cut of meat for the lamb kebabs it's a lamb shoulder I always find that a leg of lamb is kind of odd pieces and of course rack of lamb was too fancy so it's a lamb shoulder and you can cut it in cubes very easily so I want one and a half inch cubes and what I'm going to do is I'm going to marinate this in olive oil red wine fresh herbs it's gonna be just delicious okay so that's the lamb I've got about 40 pieces of lambs about three pounds and now I'm gonna cut up some garlic got a lamb and garlic and rosemary all kinds of Mediterranean spices so it's about five or six cloves of garlic just mince it up I'm gonna let this marinate for a couple of hours but if you can let it marinate overnight or even for a day or two it's even better okay that's the garlic that's a lot of garlic it's a lot of lamb too okay then one about two tablespoons of fresh rosemary take the rosemary and just run your finger down the stem get the leaves off just chop up the rosemary since the lamb kebabs are sort of Mediterranean theme everything's gonna be met attorney in the table setting the wine the garden okay that's the rosemary and now some thyme I love to use fresh thyme I really think spices and in jars sometimes consider round in the store for years and just doesn't have the same flavor as fresh herbs okay right on top okay that's the time now I need 1/2 a cup of olive oil have a cup of red wine it was used something I'm gonna drink for dinner so some kind of an Italian I'm Mediterranean wine just pour it right over that lamb and the herbs and then a splash of red wine vinegar really brings out the flavors it's not a quarter of a cup toss it all together okay just need salt and pepper 2 teaspoons of salt 1 teaspoon of pepper stir it all together I can already smell the rosemary and garlic it smells delicious I'm gonna let it marinate for a few hours in the refrigerator and they're gonna put on skewers with red onion and put it on the grill it's gonna be really fun I can't wait to see what Miguel is up to i nice making lamb kabobs tonight so I thought we'll use rosemary plants as centerpieces at the end when the meal is done we can actually break a few leaves of the plant and sprinkle them on our meat so as long as I was going with a Mediterranean theme I thought tomatoes feta I make a salad out of that so I'm gonna make it tomato feta salad I was trying to choose the tomatoes that taste the best so I choose grape tomatoes they're really just delicious they're grape shaped I have about 4 pints of cherry tomatoes it's gonna put these right into this big bowl and I've chopped up a cup and a half of red onion give it lots of flavor okay next I'm gonna make the vinaigrette so I need about 6 tablespoons of olive oil which is between a quarter and a half a cup 1/4 of a cup of white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar whatever you have that's good about two teaspoons of kosher salt 1 teaspoon of pepper it's gonna mix that up I don't put the feta in last cuz I don't want it to get crumbly I toss it all together okay so the longer this sit than where the flavors get into the tomatoes vinaigrette and the red onion this would be pretty good by itself but I think it's gonna be even better with feta okay so I'm a nice big chunk of feta so this is a Greek feta French feta is very good pick something has great flavor too they want to make cubes rather than have it crumble into the salad otherwise it just looks like a mess this is about one and a half pounds this is great for any kind of party because you serve it at room temperature or garden temperature you have to worry about having it hot or cold or whatever [Music] nice big cubes in the salad I'm just gonna fold it in carefully so I don't break the feta [Music] now the last thing is and chop up some fresh herbs pull them in so fresh basil whatever you have around is great time but I'm gonna use basil and parsley okay just chop this up roughly in goes the basil parsley he's flat leaf parsley I think it is a little more flavor than curly parsley but doesn't matter that much okay they can't fit with fresh parsley I'm gonna toss it together very carefully let the flavors really blend together the feta and the red onion and next I'm gonna make a real treat I'm gonna make lighter-than-air chocolate angel food cake with a chocolate ganache on would be really good so I decided I'm gonna make a chocolate angel food cake it's an angel food cake with chocolate chunks what sort of chocolate flakes and a dark chocolate lace on the top so the first thing I have to do is sift together half a cup of sugar and 100 third cups of cake flour it's actually just regular cake flour it's not self-rising be sure you get the right one I'm just going to sift it together four times just to make sure it's really well combined perfect now this is the key to really good angel food cake is room-temperature eggs I have about one and a half cups which is ten to twelve egg whites okay so I need 3/4 of teaspoon salt one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar so I'm gonna beat these up for about a minute until they get sort of soft peaks and then we're gonna add lots of superfine sugar one and a half cups of superfine sugar [Music] look at it flowing it's gonna get very shiny starting to get really thick and shiny that's in the hold of me see how firm they are that's great that's exactly what we want them so when you take the beater out it stands up all by itself when it holds a peak okay now I just want to add some vanilla then I'll make the rest of the cake one teaspoon of good vanilla [Music] okay that's good for the egg whites okay it's really important not to deflate the egg whites so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put the egg whites into a big bowl and then very carefully fold the flour that's mixed with the sugar into it okay looks like an angel food cake it ready so I'm gonna just stir this in very carefully just take the spatula and go right down in the middle and then fold it over and just keep moving the ball around like that that's really a classic way to fold something it's like when you're doing mooses or angel food cake it disturbs the WIPP thing as little as possible okay this looks like it's nicely folded in don't want to overdo it just enough and now the good part I'm gonna put chocolate in it so I need about 1/2 a cup of grated chocolate this is this good semi-sweet chocolate don't want to use chocolate chips because they have stabilizers in them you just want regular chocolate and you want to do it on the course that's great it's not easy okay that should be about half a cup whoa it's everywhere let's gonna put this right in just fold the chocolate right in it smells good okay just enough so that it's folded in but not so much that you deflate the egg whites okay so I've got an ungreased 10-inch angel food cake pan I'm just gonna pour this whole thing right in just do it really carefully this is a great summer dessert because it's got a lot of flavor but it's really like not a heavy dessert clearly just smooth the top and bake this 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes I'm gonna see what Miguel is up to and when the cakes done I'm gonna go shopping there's rosemary in the lamp oh it's fabulous all right off to the stores I'll be right back I used to think when I was entertaining I had to make everything and I mean everything finally I got a little smarter and I thought I'm just gonna buy a few things assemble them and it's gonna be just delicious hey Larry all right I need some olives baby I'm these French pecially look good and the same one of the French black olives thanks so much Larry have a great day thank you so since we have a Mediterranean theme going I thought hummus would be nice I'll drizzle with olive oil sauteed pignoli it's gonna be delicious Pumas gotta have PETA I think I'll brush it with a little bit of olive oil put it on the grill with the lamb it's gonna be great okay I've got pita i've got hummus olives all i have to do now is go home and glaze the chocolate angel food cake [Music] okay I need something for the top of my chocolate angel food cake I would say chocolate chips is a good place to start so the black and white angel food cake came out pretty good but I'm gonna make it extra good with a drizzle of chocolate ganache on the top so I need about a half a pound of chocolate chips just like that I'm gonna pour some heavy cream on it and melt it and it makes ganache it's not a chocolate drizzle on top just melt it together I'm just taking it so I have a better 1/2 pound of chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate chips and about 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream okay while the chocolates melted I'm gonna get the cake set up so what I've done is I take a little piece of parchment paper and I put them right between the cake and the pedestal and that way when I drizzle the chocolate on they'll keep the pedestal really nice and clean then I can just pull them out beautiful cake and pedestal okay how's this doing and see that's just perfect you want so it's thick enough to stay in the cake and thin enough so it'll drizzle down the side [Music] that doesn't look at that [Music] [Applause] make sure it's nice all the way around it works for me and I'd say we have a nice dessert for the party [Music] time to skewer the lamb kabobs so I've got all the lambs been marinated for a few hours and it's flavored with olive oil red wine rosemary thyme I'm just gonna put a piece on the skewer another piece of onion I've cut up the red onion in quarters and then just pulled a few leaves apart oh there's garlic and olive oil this is gonna be wonderful another piece of onion does that look great no I think I'm gonna have one of my friends actually grill it get them involved I think the more involved your guests are the more fun they have you put zucchini on this anything that will grill quickly is really great it's important that the lamb pieces are all about the same size so they cook evenly if you have small pieces they'll cook too quickly okay I'd say probably one kebab per person with a few extra just in case [Music] three okay last one takes a little time but at least it's not while the guests are here okay and those are ready for the grill okay now I'm just gonna assemble a few things like hummus olives ready for the food table [Music] so store-bought hummus drizzle of olive oil some toasted pignoli nobody for a party [Music] okay guys you two come with me now put your glass and you can't drink and do this project at the same time okay who's in charge here is that the way it goes okay while we do those and we leave a little extra room for Peter Britt you know what I do I brush it with an olive oil just brush one side with olive oil lightly don't you put one Peter Daniels see how that goes yeah perfect okay can we leave you to it sure sure how long do we leave them on say like 10 to 15 minutes and turn them maybe three times while they're cooking okay and when are you coming back I'll be back really soon I'm just gonna make a sauce for the kabobs okay I'm just gonna make a really quick sauce for the lamb kabobs okay I have a cup of chicken stock I'm gonna do 1/2 a cup of olive oil 2 tablespoons of lemon juice I'm just going to let that boil away until it's reduced by that 1/2 just really concentrates the flavor and since it's why I'm gonna have fresh rosemary a couple of tablespoons of minced fresh rosemary so just chop it up this time you want it very fine because you're gonna be eating it raw so you wanted to be really finely minced put the fresh rosemary in just swirl it around a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper that's the sauce put in a sauce boat [Music] it smells great I can smell the olive oil rosemary perfect for the lamb tomatoes with Bennet totally spelled differently along [Music] remember how many times we made this chocolate angel food cake I think we ate every single one of them
it's that time of year when there's a little snap in the air and I'd love to make a really cozy dinner by the fire so I thought I'd make it a roast loin of pork with roasted vegetables and maybe for dessert rum raisin rice pudding I actually use a big Spanish onions there's so much easier to slice and dice okay and next I think I'm going to do some potatoes I'd love to use these Yukon Gold potatoes you'll see the inside they're just this gorgeous yellow color and I just find them the flavor sort of buttering really great but you can use red new potatoes or you can use white ones whatever you can find so the next thing I think I'm going to do is carrots when carrots cook they really cook down they get smaller so just be sure you use really big chunks okay into the pan with a Karin and now for my favorite vegetable general this is what fennel looks like when it's in the bulb because it has big tops on it but you usually buy it like this and you can really find in the grocery store pretty frequently now I want to cut the top off like that these are really sort of tough so you don't want to eat them but interesting thing is when it's raw it has a very strong anise flavor which is good but I'm not that crazy about it but when it's cooked it's sweet and delicious and believe me it's wonderful and then just slice the whole thing in half and you'll see there's a core here which is just fine to eat so I'm just going to cut right through the cord or keep the fennel together when it roasts just cut it in big wedges just like that and now I'm just a season it a little bit of butter a little bit of olive oil lots of salt you'd be surprised how much you need for a big pot of vegetables like this that's a freshly ground black pepper good it ready and then clean hands just toss them all together got a really beautiful loin of pork from the butcher what I'm going to do is I'm gonna make a marinade that's going to go on the top of the pork and all the flavors are going to get into it it'll sit for a little while while I worst the vegetables it's going to be really moist and delicious there's two cloves of garlic tablespoon of salt tablespoon of fresh thyme into the food processor and sumit mince it all up and the last thing I need is a quarter of a cup of mustard mix it all up I'm just going to rub it on the outside of the pork it's really like a rub that you put on top and let it just soak in okay so I'm just going to put this aside for about 30 minutes and let this gorgeous marinade get into the meat and in the meantime I'm going to roast the vegetables they smell so good all the fennel and carrots and potatoes it's really starting to get brown whoo easing two-step pork with it now I'm going to take this whole loin of pork and just put it right on top just like that and they're all going to cook together so it's going to cook at the same temperature 425 for about 30 minutes if the one of pork is this size sometimes they're much bigger something I take about 50 minutes but for this one it's 30 minutes at 425 until the loin of pork is exactly 138 degrees in the middle and it will be perfect [Music] so good so I'll have to just get the cabbage ready and dinner served
[Music] that was a great party I love the holidays but it can be so much work so this year I promised myself I'm gonna make it really easy and I'll show you how [Music] join me on a three-day countdown until the grand finale the holiday meal day one a stress-free cocktail party on the menu melon and prosciutto hot apple cider and decadent potato and caviar pancakes well it is the holidays this year I'm also gonna make my own decorations they're going to be really festive completely organic even edible [Music] day two I'll make a romantic breakfast for my husband Jeffrey scrambled eggs on brioche with caviar and I'll still have time to bake and deliver some homemade gifts to my friends festive Jam thumb prints packed up and ready to go day three main event the holiday meal so elegant it's so easy a heroic standing rib roast melt-in-your-mouth butternut squash and I'm gonna share with you my secret for making popovers rice so high your friends will truly be amazed this year I'm having in front of my own party no getting up at dawn I want to have enough energy to eat dessert well it is raspberry cheesecake it looks festive and it tastes out-of-this-world join me at my home for my three-day holiday countdown [Music] it's the start of the holiday season and some friends are stopping by for a drink I'm gonna make really simple hors d'oeuvres because I didn't want to stress myself out on day one so the first thing I'm gonna make is melon and prosciutto it's really easy all I have to do is assemble it I've cut up a Galia melon which is a really gorgeous it's really fragrant green melon and I'm just gonna wrap each piece and everybody can help themselves it looks good it tastes good it's easy I'm gonna make some hot apple cider and maybe we'll put a little dark rum in it and some very simple orders somebody gave me a gift of caviar wasn't that nice and I had some potato so I thought I'd make potato pancakes and caviar but we'll all do it together so it'll be sort of a shared activity what the prosciutto to be sliced thin enough so it's easy to eat but you want to thick enough so it doesn't sort of shred when you peel it apart [Music] when it's really cold outside there's nothing better than a house that smells like hot apple cider so I always have some bubbling away on the stove but since my friends are coming tonight I thought I'd make some and spiked it mmm so I'm gonna start with good apple cider and this is the time of year for it there's 16 cups or a gallon so it smells good already and then with all kinds of spices in it you can actually get apple cider spices but I'd rather do it myself so the first thing is all this gorgeous orange peel I'm just gonna put it right in and then the juice of the two oranges [Music] already smells good this biggest-ever is so freaking tired day okay juice of two oranges and then lots of spices I love cinnamon so I think that would be just wonderful for cinnamon sticks and clothes are gonna make it really spicy maybe eight cloves and I like star anise it's really licorice so I'm gonna put six in but whatever you like just put it in its wonderful and that's it it's just going to simmer away on the stove and then when my friends get here I thought maybe a little dark rum I mean how bad can that be [Music] I love his Hampton in the snow it's so beautiful during the holidays I'm tempted to do a million things to decorate but at the end of the day it's really so much better to have one big statement like all these branches and I'll show you how I'm going to decorate them so what I've done is I've sliced fruit really thin like oranges and apples and I put them on a rack in the oven overnight at a really low temperature like 170 degrees and in the morning I have dried fruit ornaments like this pear and I just put them on little strings of raffia and they can stay in a closed container for weeks and just decorate the cherry with it so it's edible its organic and it's beautiful [Music] coming up my decadent potato and caviar pancakes and lots of friends to ensure Latham the party will be so stress-free that we'll even have the energy to bake the next morning [Music] Teta pancakes and caviar it's such a great holiday order so I'm grading two pounds of potatoes and then I'm gonna make a batter out of it but first I want to squeeze as much water out of the potatoes as possible just in that kitchen towel it's a little messy but it's really worth doing and just roll it up watch this and then amazing how much water comes out of these at the dryer they are the better the potato pancakes are okay that's a lot of the water out I'm just gonna put them in a bowl so now I'm gonna make the batter I have two eggs then you just mix them in the ball when they're and that six tablespoons of flour two teaspoons of salt what about a half a teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna mix this whole thing up and make the batter when my friends are here I'm gonna make these with creme fraiche and caviar on the top but you can do anything you do applesauce you can do sour cream and caviar or you can just eat them plain but it's gonna be fun because I'm gonna have them cook with me and love candles but I hate really strongly scented ones that compete with the food sort of like having good wine you want it to complement food so since we're having spiced apple cider I thought I would have cloves and cinnamon in the bottom of the candles and then when you light the candle you get all of that scent from the warmth of the candle so I'm just gonna put it right here in this hurricane maybe a few cinnamon sticks at the bottom so it's beautiful and it's holiday-ish but it's not some jasmine candle that's really competing with your food it smells good already [Music] [Music] so Michael you charge your drinks okay hot apple cider and rum for everybody lots of rum for me okay then you cook to help me are you are you available Barbara fantastic I'm gonna put the potato pancakes right there and how would you like to put creme fraiche which is right there and a little bit of caviar on the top perfect that looks great thank you well it's just cuz they have caviar on it right [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] every still asleep it's time to make the cookies first thing is first coffee [Music] instead of spending a fortune on Christmas gifts I think it's so much nicer to bake cookies for people so I'm gonna make my favorite Jam thumb prints so I've got 3/4 of a pound of butter a cup of sugar you need to use butter for good cookies and a teaspoon of vanilla and I just mixed it up I didn't whip it just mix it up and now I'm gonna get the flour ready 3 and a half cups of flour try and get it all over yourself at the same time like I do I'm just gonna put it through a sifter at 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt sift it through see there's always something that you wish you had sifted at the bottom so I always make it a policy to do that ok I'm just gonna turn it on low and just slowly add the flour to the butter and sugar okay mix it up well that's it so I'm just gonna roll it into a ball but first now a lot of people ask me what the paddle attachment is this is actually the beater but it's also called the paddle as opposed to the whisk or the dough hook okay clear the desk here dump it out this dough looks perfect messy but perfect so I'm just gonna roll it into a ball and a disk little plastic wrap put it in the fridge for about a half an hour and they'll be ready to make their cookies but first I better bring Geoffrey some coffee coming up a romantic breakfast for Geoffrey and May and time to spare to bake gifts for my friends I love making Jam thumb prints they're really very old-fashioned cookies but they taste better than you expect very nostalgic for the holidays so let me show you what I'm doing so I'm going to take a piece of the dough it's chilled but not really cold and hard and being obsessive as I am I'm gonna weigh each one and it's great if each one is about an ounce then I'm gonna just put it in an egg wash whether just egg in a little bit of water roll it in the coconut it's great because the coconut gets toasted when you bake it it looks good it tastes good and then just make a little indentation for the jam now I'm gonna fill the middle of each one with a little bit of jam raspberry jam and then when it bakes the jam gets into the cookie it's so good and apricot jam okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes and they're gonna be really golden brown and the coconut will be crisp and flavorful I love these Jam thumb prints it makes lots of jam thumb prints [Music] now I'm just going to get started on the breakfast table no since Geoffrey's missing the holiday dinner I thought at least he should feel like he's had a holiday meal so I'm gonna make breakfast special okay and I had clementines in the fridge and I have these dried pomegranates that I keep around during the holidays they're great cuz they last forever a little spiky doesn't it I think any different kinds of greens will make it look a little softer and the place is your place don't forget me as a gift and I love them.i storage napkin to match the clementines [Music] and if it's a holiday anymore celebrate gotta have champagne I say that stuff great I smell toasted coconut [Music] shortbread coconut and jam who wouldn't like those [Music] I just must serve [Music] so while those cool I'm gonna make some breakfast time to make breakfast but not everyday breakfast I'm gonna make scrambled eggs with leftover caviar on the top the first thing I need to do is get the brioche in the toaster nice big thick slice this is one big slice I'm going to slice it in half into the texture okay toasts in and scramble the eggs I think everybody knows how to make scrambled eggs but these are particularly good for a holiday I'm going to instead of you smell communities a little half-and-half it seems like it's always a holiday here splash of half-and-half so not too much cuz the caviar is salty pepper and I'm gonna cook them on a very low heat you don't want to cook protein on a high heat otherwise it gets tough we first see Jeffrey's ready sweetie wanna come help me okay excellent got reinforcements hi sweetie breakfast is almost ready want to get the drinks ready okay mm-hmm they're glasses right there there's champagne and orange juice in the fridge okay and I'm gonna make scrambled eggs should I get one bottle for you one bottle for me oh that looks good are you gonna wrestle that bottle of champagne to the to the ground until the court let me know who wins okay here goes okay I'm ready ready yeah excellent whoa you gonna drink the champagne yeah exactly I'd say I wanna drink the champagne forget the scrambled eggs and caviar happy holidays screaming I love you hmm it did an extraordinary job I'm really impressed with my resume little caviar that's great it's just so what exactly are you going to work we haven't figured that out I think you don't me as a lot of work so I think we need to restructure I'd say you're gonna miss a really good party keep some leftovers okay no time to feel sad about Jeffrey's leaving port guy has to work tomorrow I've got gifts to pack and deliver and I'll need to start the raspberry cheesecake for tomorrow's holiday meal [Music] definitely something bubbly for the holidays Prosecco it's an Italian sparkling wine it's less expensive than champagne I think I'll mix it with cassis and make kir Royale that's gonna be good [Music] for my holiday meal tomorrow I'm gonna make a very traditional rib roast for dinner and a slightly less traditional cheesecake for dessert it's really good so I'm gonna start the cheesecake first the crust I'm gonna up 3/4 of a stick of butter why does every recipe start with butter but for a holiday meal it has to be that way so I'm gonna make a graham cracker crust for the cheesecake it's so much easier than pastry crust I'm going to take 10 graham crackers and just grind [Music] if you don't have a food processor you can also do it with a rolling pin just roll it out and crumble them so graham crackers tablespoon of sugar and now for the butter traditional American cheesecake tends to be very dense kind of like a block of cream cheese with that red cherry stuff on the top a little too red so what I'm gonna make is a cheesecake that's much lighter and has lemon and vanilla in it so it has lots of flavor and fresh raspberries on top it's really good okay that's ready and I love anything that doesn't have a pastry crust graham cracker crust so much easier [Music] okay this is ready it's gonna press it in just do it evenly around this is a wonderful thing to make for the holidays because in fact it's better if you make it in advance okay into the oven 350 degrees for eight minutes it's gonna be so good so now for the thumbprint cookies so I can pack these without eating them last year I gave them to everybody for the holiday and of course this year they're expecting them again there's a metal right away I'm gonna put them in this glass een bag and you get them a party good stores or at art supply stores I just think you can really see the cookies so a few apricot ones two raspberry ones just a pretty white ribbon at the end sharp scissors are better okay just I find if you hold the bag open at the top and then pull it together it comes out really pretty double knot and it's ready to give away as a gift [Music] so I can smell the Cheesecake crust is about ready so I'm just gonna take it out of the oven and then deliver these to my friends I think they'll be happy to see me that looks done gotta go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] happy holidays vertook Jim's son Prince your favorite myself before anybody do you need to have a hot chocolate shit so many errands to do [Music] [Applause] [Music] and now the cheesecake filling I've got two and a half pounds of cream cheese at room temperature and one and a half cups of sugar all mixed up together and I'm gonna add the eggs it's five whole eggs and two egg yolks gotta break some eggs to make good cheesecake I'm gonna scrape it down make sure it's really well mixed already looks like cheese kicked go to the cupboard sour cream and this is what I my steez cake is really good it has lots of flavor a tablespoon of lemon zest and half a tablespoon of good vanilla extract make sure it's really well mixed and that's really the mixture I'm going to pour it into the crust and then after I bake it I'm gonna put fresh raspberries on the top it's gonna be so gorgeous and into the crust this is the crust that I baked for eight minutes and it's just a little cooled and I'm gonna bake it at 450 degrees for 15 minutes and then lower the temperature to 225 and bake it for an hour and 15 minutes and that's my favorite cheesecake just the table to set tonight and I'm ready for the big day I do hope you stay for the party [Music] so the last big thing I have to do tonight is get the dining room ready for dinner tomorrow so just when everybody's expecting me to fill the house of flowers I love to use fruits and vegetables to decorate I'll show you how great it is so I've got lemons and small oranges but I thought artichokes look great sort of like pinecones but better tucked in the greens and that's my favorite holiday table it's a deliverer your brief and I'm gonna make it right down the center of the table it's got gorgeous color texture and actually even scent so in among the branches I'm gonna put all kinds of gorgeous fruit it's really important to have greens that are very flat on the table if they're too bushy oh really sort of lose the impact of the fruit and lines you use clementines or tangelos any kind of really small kind of orange and lemons never kind of beautiful fruit you can find but it should be small not no big things and just tuck them in between the greens and then up to use grapes because it sort of messes it up a little bit right down the middle red grapes green grapes I just wanted to look through a band and very cornucopia like then the last night is really important as candles [Music] they've got a beautiful holiday table and all you had to do is go to the produce market for it plates and verses and I think that [Music] cheesecake's should be done in the oven off oh it looks great so I'm just gonna let it sit in the oven with a door oven for about 30 minutes and when it's cool I'm gonna refrigerate it can't wait for tomorrow my friends are coming for a holiday meal so I better get started first thing we're gonna make is mustard horseradish sauce it's gonna be so good with standing rib roast and I'm making a really easy one so I need 1 and 1/2 cups of mayonnaise another 1/2 third of a cup of sour cream there are sauces that I make where you have to cook for 45 minutes and their sauces I make like this one that take like five minutes so for the holidays I try and keep it simple now for the flavor three tablespoons a good Dijon mustard one an empty spoons of coarse grain mustard which you can always buy in the grocery store it's really great it's you can see the coarse grains of mustard in it so not only does it add flavor but it makes the sauce look like mustard which I really like 1 tablespoon of prepared horseradish forget grading it yourself and 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt whisk it all together I love when something I'm making actually looks like what it is and because of the coarse mustard it really looks like mustard and that's ready all I'm gonna do is put it in gorgeous Bowl to serve him and nobody needs to know and only took five minutes I think nothing makes it feel more like a holiday than a standing rib roast and I've got a gorgeous one so this is a three-way broast isn't that incredible and all I have to do is season it and throw it in the oven so I'm going to use a tablespoon of salt it sounds like a lot but it's a large piece of meat just spread it on the top it's gonna be so good with mustard horseradish sauce mmm and 1/2 tablespoon of pepper rub it all over the top and it's ready for the oven how easy is that I'm gonna roast it at 500 degrees for 45 minutes turn the oven down to 325 for another 30 minutes and then turn it back up to 450 for 30 minutes and it's gonna be really crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside it's gonna be so good for holiday meal with a standing rib roast my all-time favorite vegetable is butternut squash I'm gonna roast it with brown sugar and get it really caramelized so good this is two butternut squash cubed cube them really large I think they look better and they roast better and then I'm gonna add some melted butter it's a holiday so you can use butter brown sugar which caramelizes them lots of salt black pepper and this is the messy part clean hands just toss it all together and that's it I'm gonna rest at a really high temperature 400 degrees for about 45 to 55 minutes and the acid gets really browned and caramelized and the inside is really juicy and sweet it's gonna be really good with a roast coming up popovers to bake and a rib roast a car then it's party time I hope you'll come [Music] so I'm in the homestretch now next thing I want to do is decorate the cheesecake so I'm gonna make raspberry topping for it forget those floppy red cherries that you usually find on the top of a cheesecake I just think it's so much nicer to fresh fruit so I'm going to do a raspberry topping but I've done is melt a cup of red jelly it's red currant jelly but you can use raspberry jelly or strawberry jelly or whatever you like you don't really need any water and it just melt the jelly one more second okay I'm gonna turn off the heat and then I'm gonna put three half pints of fresh raspberries right into the jelly and it's gonna coat them and make them really shiny and I'll show you how great it looks on the Cheesecake I'm just gonna toss these together really gently because I don't want to break the berries and the jelly is gonna coat the raspberries okay and then it's just going to go right on the cheesecake and the key here is to just pile it up you don't want to have any kind of arranged raspberries here and if it drips down the front all the better maybe I'll help it drip down the side and I would say that's a raspberry cheesecake fit for anybody's holiday dinner Rose smells so good [Music] that looks like a party so just make sure the internal temperature is 125 degrees and then I'm gonna cover it with aluminum foil aluminum foil a minute just people used to cooking the middle a little bit so it stays nice and hot and a little let it sit for just 20 minutes and then I'm gonna carve it [Music] so the last thing we're gonna make is popover it's their really old-fashioned and there's so much easier than you think they are first I need to clear the decks a little bit okay I need one and a half cups of milk I'm gonna mix them in this measuring cup so I can just pour them right into the pans and three eggs the good news about this batteries you can make it not only early in the day you can make the day before and leave it in the fridge then just pour it into the popover pans okay three cloves of teaspoon of salt why don't have cups of flour the last thing is wanting to have tablespoons of melted butter now there are two key things about successful popovers first is heat the pans beforehand for exactly two minutes and I'll tell you the second one just fill them about two-thirds full I've greased the pans really well so I make sure they come out no point in making popovers if you can't get them out of the pan well that worked out perfectly okay into the oven 425 for exactly 30 minutes and this is the other secret don't peek right now all I have to do is get myself ready [Music] okay huh needs a little family so now all I have to do is carve the roast and get everyone the table oh my god they're wonderful it's gonna carve a few slices and then finish carving it at the table I think it looks so much more dramatic just got it started and then because I think that I always like to decorate the platter with something in the dish but here we have beef salt and pepper I thought some table decoration would be great and green grapes I thought would be the perfect touch simple elegant and ready for the table [Music] [Music] [Laughter] all right who's first Mike you don't want it ready for cheesecake thank you and honey would you like a little raspberry cheesecake and Cecily [Laughter] [Applause]
[Music] cocktail party 450 sounds done one thing doesn't it I wanted to do a book party for my friend Edwina fun girl but it really didn't want it to cost a fortune so we've asked a friend to bartend Edwina is ordering the rentals and I'm gonna do very easy orders that I can make all by myself wait you see it we this house it's so beautiful and I'm hoping for really gorgeous day [Music] so when I'm doing a really big party of a few rules for myself the first one is I make really easy orders the second one is they make things that I can do in advance and the third one is I don't make too many things so for doing this party I'm gonna make cheddar and chutney sandwiches I'm gonna make some tuna tartare some smoked salmon tea sandwiches and then as everybody leaves they're gonna get a wonderful cupcake with a flower on the top so the first thing I'm gonna make is the smoked salmon tea sandwiches and I have to make herb butter for it so if you need to make our butter you need a lots of butter this is two and a half pounds of butter but it's gonna make probably more than 100 tea sandwiches you want room-temperature butter because I'm gonna mix this with lots of herbs and seasonings and if it's cold you'll never be able to mix it so two and a half pounds of butter yikes I'm gonna put in about a tablespoon of garlic want this to have lots of flavor quarter of a cup of chopped scallions I use the white and the green parts because not only do they both have flavor but I love that the green you can see the green scallion in the butter about a quarter of a cup of fresh dill so just run your knife along the stems like this you learn to pick up every leaf and just chop it up roughly you love the smell of fresh dill and then I'm gonna make cupcakes with a fresh flower on each one since Edwina's book is called fresh cuts about flowers I thought it was totally appropriate and then a quarter of a cup of fresh parsley so this has lots of green herbs and I just think it gives the butter really fresh sort of spicy kind of flavor and it complements the salmon beautifully okay about a quarter of a cup of fresh parsley and we just need some salt and pepper about one and a half tablespoons of salt remember it's a lot of herb butter makes a lot of sandwiches one teaspoon of freshly ground pepper and then the last thing is unusual in butter but I think it really gives it a great flavor is the juice of one lemon I'm just gonna do it through a strainer so I don't end up with any seeds in the butter if I'm doing a lot of lemons I'll use a legit but just for one this is perfect okay get all the lemon juice now I'm just gonna put in the mixer and just compile it until it's next that looks great hey nice sharp bread knife Saturday night really works [Music] [Music] nice big tray I'm just gonna put it on the tray and when the butter is chilled it's gonna be very firm cut off the crust and cut in half two tea sandwiches I'm just gonna keep going and I think edweena's at the rental company now love doing a party with her let's see could we start with the silver platters sure I'm going to need 14 of them right here typical tray that I'm I usually loves so you also need some glasses yes we do glass it all the time glass beautiful we gave you 150 okay thank you you're very welcome and that's the last one okay I'm gonna show you my trick about storing them so you can make them before the party and they'll stay really fresh so I'm gonna take damp paper towels and cover the bread and then wrap the tray really tightly and it keeps the sandwiches really fresh you don't want to wake this don't want the bread wet you just want it damn just enough so you can't wring it out and then unfold it neatly and put it right on top of the top row of bread just like that make sure it's all covered just like yeah okay and I'm gonna wrap it in plastic wrap really tightly to make sure it's completely covered the best way to do that is to have the plastic wrap go completely around the bottom otherwise it really won't stick very well just pull it up on the edges make sure it's completely surrounded plastic wrap sticks to itself better than anything else so this is the way to do it okay and into the fridge and then at the party I'm gonna cut them in triangles and put them on beautiful silver trays they're gonna be really good and now we're gonna make cupcakes [Music] except for the cupcakes I've already got tuna quarter sticks of butter three cups of sugar and three eggs I need three more eggs I always crack eggs into a separate bowl just in case you get shell or bad egg don't ruin the whole batter just add them one at a time so this is gonna make 24 cupcakes and I'm gonna make two batches make sure it's all really well mixed butter the eggs the sugar this is why these cupcakes are so good one cup of sour cream sour cream really makes it moist yes again one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla extract and my favorite smells mix the vanilla in okay now for the dry ingredients the first thing is three cups of flour let's regular all-purpose flour two three third of a cup of cornstarch cornstarch actually lightens the batter it's a little like having cake flour but I find cake flour really hard to find so cornstarch is good teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda this is what's gonna make it rise and then just sift it all together perfect that's the dry ingredients I just run my hands through it make sure it's really well mixed before I put it into the butter and sugar and eggs okay then I'm just gonna put the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients this is the point where you don't want to over mix it so the flour doesn't get tough on low speed just very slowly add all the dry ingredients to the butter and sugar and eggs no lumps okay crash take the beater out I'm just gonna stir it by hand with a spatula and they sure it's really well mixed these are just muffin pans you can buy in the hardware store and I just put paper liners and they're so easy to get out ice cream scoop is great for making cupcakes everyone comes out exactly the same size [Music] so into the oven 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes and then later I'm gonna ice them with cream cheese frosting to find some flowers for the cupcakes and pansies seem like a good idea the icing is white so we have cupcakes you gotta have icing so I'm gonna make a cream cheese frosting for these cupcakes something nice and light so I'm gonna do a pound of butter remember it's a lot of cupcakes found in half of cream cheese you want all the butter and the cream cheese at room temperature I actually leave it out overnight just to make sure it's really room temperature otherwise it's gonna be lumpy nobody need to add the icing this can be enough icing for my first batch of cupcakes 24 then I'm gonna make it again okay pound of confectioner's sugar I actually love to sift the confession of sugar because I don't want little sort of lumps of sugar and the icing it just takes a minute but it really ensures that the icing smooth and creamy okay so while the mixer is on low just putting on the sugar okay and some vanilla got one and a half teaspoons just make sure it's smooth and creamy and it's done ready to ice how do those look just smooth it around with a regular knife [Music] you this is so easy it doesn't even need a recipe hey there's a little brioche Ross that my friend Eli Zabar makes I love them I'm gonna fill them with chutney and a slice of cheddar and that's it and they're so good so I'm gonna put a dollop of chutney on each one and a slice of cheddar put its a little hat back on that's ready for the party this is a mango chutney but any kind of sweet and sour chutney is good how easy is that a love party de brie our sandwiches are done and the last thing to make is fresh tuna tartare what you see this it's great when you go to the fish store to ask for fresh tuna ask for sushi grade tuna you want a center cut piece and it shouldn't have any fishy smell at all so I've sliced the tuna in quarter inch slices and now I'm gonna make quarter inch dice so it's very small pieces but it's not really minced after I've marinated this in the lime juice marinade I'm going to add all kinds of flavorings and seasonings like scallions and chili peppers did a little heat and then I'm going to add diced avocados which gives it great flavor and texture so that's four and a half pounds of fresh tuna so now for the marinade do you want to have cups of good olive oil okay one more in one cup of lime juice don't even think about using the bottle kind is that's of six fresh limes a lot of zest but it's gonna give a lot of flavor a tablespoon of wasabi powder which is really really really hot Japanese horseradish generally don't use the tablespoons this is a lot of marinade next is soy sauce 3 tablespoons of soy sauce which is really the salt in it wanting to have tablespoons of Tabasco which is more heat but remember it's a lot of tuna now okay that's good salt and pepper that's two tablespoons of freshly ground pepper okay I'm just gonna whisk that together it's really just like making a very spicy vinaigrette just gonna pour it over the tuna just mix it together mmm that's pretty good already okay now I'm gonna add some other great things why don't have cups of chopped scallions lots of scallions a quarter of a cup of chili peppers they're really hot but they're good mix those in now I need about six diced avocados right into the tuna just mix it in a little bit just make sure the lime just gets to the avocado to keep it from turning brown about two tablespoons of sesame seeds on top so it's really lots of Asian flavorings and seasonings a little California avocado thrown in and then later after it's marinated at the party I'm gonna serve it on the cracker I'll let it marinate for about an hour in the refrigerator [Music] oK we've got lots of stuff okay what do you have the perfect cheddar and chutney sandwiches smoked salmon sandwiches and how about if you and I come back and get the rest okay Leon's house is so perfect today and these are the pan oh these are gonna be so wonderful on our cupcakes oh I can't wait okay more thing Stan's in the car and since it's your party you get to get dressed okay okay the last thing I have to do is just put everything on trays so my little chutney sandwiches I get a whole stack of silver trays from the rental company just make big trays of things this is a little brioche sandwiches with chutney and cheddar they're gonna be really good no don't think I'm gonna stack them I think they look perfect just like that so those are the four your sandwiches and then we're gonna do the smoked salmon tea sandwiches okay let's see how these guys look it's gonna be wonderful so now what I want to do is just take the crusts off they're nice and cold so they're really firm and easy to cut it's easy to do and I think it really looks nicer and then each squares just gonna be cutting a triangle I just put right down the track so these are vanilla cupcakes with cream cheese icing so I kinda told me and I'm going to put these little panties on that we bought yesterday to look like a meadow so I thought maybe if they appear to sit they have just kind of blown in not too many so these adorable little things are just for decoration they're not to be eaten and then just before everybody gets here and we make the tuna tartare it's amazing how the lime juice keeps the avocado food turning brown and it also cooks the tuna and a few trays outside so people come out enjoy this incredible view a little cheddar and well it's gonna refill some plates we've got friends handing out orders everybody chips friend even Venus is doing the bar I'd say the great things are going to penalties enjoying themselves and that's ready to go out thank you I'm so glad you came Edwin I think we did a great part
[Music] so what I did was I asked the butcher to bone a leg of lamb but just to leave the end of the sort of the shank end in and it just gives it a little better form this is one big leg of lamb really nice and it's trimmed and tied okay now for the marinade so the first thing I'm going to do is have a better tablespoon of fresh rosemary and again you just want to slide your fingers right down the stalk and just take any tough stems out that should be that that should be bad enough remember rosemary is really strongly flavored you don't want too much and that six cloves of garlic that's going to go into it so usually I do this in a food processor I'm not big on specialized equipment but this little mini food processor is so useful for tasks like this so I'm going to put the rosemary and the garlic and tablespoon of salt [Music] teaspoon of pepper and buy two tablespoons of melted butter right into this little processor this is going to puree it can I make a lot of noise too how's that pretty easy okay now we're just going to put this rub it right onto the lamb and it's infuse the land with great flavor and then when it's roasted over the potatoes the flavor the potatoes to that garlic and rosemary I know it seems like a lot of salt and pepper but it has been seasoned the entire lamb and the potato so that's just going to rest on the meat for about thirty minutes while the flavors really get into the lamb this is going to be so good and all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay that's potatoes and this brings a little unusual I'm going to put in six cloves unpeeled garlic so right in with potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes Brown and when I said and then right on top the gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic now I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot and be great and it'll be about now and a quarter to an hour and a half I think the land might be done so what I'm going to do is take it out put it on a platter and just let it rest for about 20 minutes some big way we're just going to cover it with foil to keep it warm and this allows the juices to get back into the land lambs been resting for about 20 minutes so it's perfect and if taking the strings off and now only need to do it Garvin nice thing about that is it's boneless so we can really slice it anyway and to be very good I'm just going to serve on a big platter with all the vegetables together [Music]
[Music] I love a beach picnic but I hate dragging all that stuff to the beach so I'm going to pack my salads and lemon cake and Chinese takeout containers and we have a very good time I having a beach picnics and I'm going to bring shrimp salad pasta pesto and T's and my favorite lemon cake transports really well to the beach so I'm going to show you how to make this if you can make it fun and cake you can make any cake I've got room-temperature butter half a town and two cups of sugar that I've been mixing in the mixer until it's really light and fluffy then I'm going to add four room-temperature eggs I'm going to add the eggs one at a time and just let them get incorporated into the butter and sugar okay the next thing going to put in is a third of a cup of grated lemon zest and that's goes in wonderful okay then I have to put together my dry ingredients and wet ingredients first the wet ingredients I have a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice that I've squeezed buttermilk which is great it's a low-fat milk that's got a culture in it so quarter of a cup of lemon juice plus 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk and the next thing vanilla I love the smell of vanilla I figure out how to put it into almost every big product so teaspoon of vanilla now the dry ingredients so that's three cups of flour half a teaspoon of baking soda has a piece from the baking powder and a teaspoon of salt salt surprisingly important in baking things really brings out the lemon and the lemon cake Adam just in the fifties together sifting really combines it but it also make sure that there's nothing in the bottom so I want to put them in alternately starting and ending with the dry ingredients just until it's mixed and then add the wet ingredients this keeps the batter from getting too thick or too runny and it keeps it really light great thing about this recipe is it's in fact better the next day so if you're having a party it's really great to make it in advance and then the last flour so that's it I've got the dry ingredients the wet ingredients and I'm just going to give it one more mix with a spatula make sure it's really well mixed and all the fresh one wonderful just one more mix with a spatula okay right over here I've got two baking pans that I've greased and floured and a little piece of parchment paper on the bottom so there's no point in making a delicious cake if you can't get it out of the pan divide this up evenly that looks good even right looks good so they're going to bake 350 degrees for about 40 to 45 minutes and after they come out I have a simple syrup made of lemon juice and sugar and then the drizzle on the top and it's soaked in and it just has such a fresh lemon flavor and it keeps it incredibly moist [Music] I'm making a shrimp salad and this little celery is going to be just perfect for it put that lovely I'm going to take two pounds of shrimp they're still in the shell I think they say moister if you cook them in the shell and I'm pouring it into a pot of boiling water that's got lemon and salt in it and that will flavor it while they cook so the key to really good shrimp salad is to make sure that you don't cook the shrimp for more than three minutes it doesn't seem like a long time but if they cook for more than that they will definitely be overcooked what I'm looking for is to know that the shrimp are firm and hot and they're really done so I'm going to take them out and put the nice water stop the cooking immediately see how fast I was that almost wasn't even three minutes okay so now that it's an ice-water I can actually peel them right away so you take off the tail and then take off the shell and there's a little vein that goes right down the back of the shrimp that I want to take out just take it out with your knife that's done excellent so for the sauce it's a mayonnaise sauce but what I'd love to do with mayonnaise is skin it with some kind of flavoring I'm going to start with 1 cup of mayonnaise I don't like that sort of gloppy mayonnaise thick mayonnaise taste so I always send it with something I'm going to do it with white wine just to my head in the fridge just tablespoon or so so that that's good that sort of the texture of it which is so much nicer than manager and then we're going to add all kinds of flavorings let's see how that's a mustard let me have a teaspoon and salt once itself to be really well flavored because the shrimp are fairly bland and you wanted to really season this off nice pepper so we've got lots of fresh dill that I've cut up here just enough about three tablespoons of dill in there I'm just going to taste it and see how the sauce remember it has to be really highly seasoned because it's going to mix with the shrimp it's delicious got lots of flavor okay and then the shrimp I'm going to pour the sauce right over the shrimp mix that all together and then I'm going to add some fresh vegetables just think some celery which is really traditional and some red onion which will give it a little spice are really good I'm going to put on one and a half cups of chopped celery and I'm just going to use half an onion mix it all together so this looks great it's got a nice creamy dressing and all the fresh vegetables the celery and onions and the shrimp with dill I was just perfect just clip it enhance the flavor of the shrimp my friends are going to love it mm-hmm and that that's my lemon cakes now I'm going to make a lemon syrup that's going to soak into the cake 1/2 a cup of lemon juice and then you'd have a cup of sugar this syrup is going to make this cake so moist and also it keeps it for a long time so it will stay moist for days in fact I think it's moister after it sits for a day or two so it allows you to make the cake a day or two before the party which is great I'm just going to cook this long enough so that the sugar dissolves and it becomes a really simple syrup and this'll take about two minutes so while that's happening I'm going to take the cakes out of the pan so these are cool enough so that it starts to pull away from the pan just run my knife around the edge and remember there's parchment paper on the bottom so if I'm lucky they should come out perfectly well and they did peel the parchment off I'm going to leave it I like to leave it upside down on the pan because it soaks in better there and then I'll turn it right-side up later perfect fill the parchment off just put it down on the pan great what you have syrups doing one of the things I believe is that you don't need a million different recipes if you have 10 good recipes that you're really comfortable with and three variations you really have a huge repertoire this lemon cake is one of those things so what I'm doing now is spooning this syrup right over the cake and it's just going to soak in and it's going to have all that flavor of the fresh lemon juice so the acidity of the juice and the sweetness of the sugar will be really delicious so I'm going to do is let the syrup soak into these cakes and then I'm going to make my pasta pesto and peach salad for my picnic a first trick it's frozen peas because I think they're actually delicious and when they're picked they're blanched and then frozen so they're just as good as shelling them yourself which could take forever to pour them into a colander just run them under hot water and just let them sit in to think for a minute so I cook the pasta ready i actually made two different kinds bowties little bow ties and fusilli these but you can use any kind of dried pasta so first thing i'm going to do is make pesto which is wonderful it's just basil and garlic really old-fashioned Italian thing and a little bit of walnuts and the food processor got a quarter of a cup tablespoons pignoli which are pine nuts that's was usually made with one of the other but I like to flavor when you make make it with both next ingredient is garlic with three big pieces of garlic and salt and pepper so lots of pepper I like it really spicy lots of pepper and then one and a half cups of basil jump right in and I'm going to try this and then while that's going on a pour in about 1/3 of a cup of olive oil right through the seafood you so it's basic pesto and then I'm going to add a few more ingredients to make a sauce for some Parmesan cheese I actually add spinach it's frozen chopped spinach that's been defrosted but a half a package and about three quarters of a cup of mayonnaise and squeeze of fresh lemon it's a really great sauce on pasta because it's spicy and it's flavorful there we go nice lemon lemon and the spinach and we keep the pesto from turning brown [Applause] okay so to make sure it's perfect remember the sauce has to be really flavorful the pasta doesn't have much flavor mmm garlic and spicy a little more salt salt so important for pesto really bring out the basil flavor so that's my sauce I'm going to toss it with the pasta and add some final ingredients so that's the pasta and the pesto we toss this together so you can really smell the garlic and you see the spinach has kept the pesto really green so now we have pasta pesto we need peas so I the frozen peas that I defrosted I'm just going to add some on behalf of package and for lots of flavor I'm going to add more Parmesan cheese a little more salt and pepper and the last ingredient is pignoli nuts I think these really add just a great flavor to the salad and they look great so it's green and white so let's make sure this tastes right oh it's got so much flavor parmesan and basil and garlic we love that garlic so that's already all I've left to do is make my tomato feta salad and ice wine lemon cakes also for my beach picnic I already have shrimp salad pasta pesto and peas and now I'm going to glaze these gorgeous lemon cakes and turn them right side up remember they're all infuser that lemon syrup so it's going to be wonderful now I want to make a fresh lemon glaze for the job so the first thing is confectioner sugar dump about two cups in the bowl and more fresh lemon juice so the squeeze it in here so I'll get seeds in the glaze I just love the flavor of the fresh lemon juice and this makes it tart and sweet with the sugar okay that should do it I'm just going to pour enough in so that it makes it runny but not so much that it's too thin it's really a matter of the balance between the lemon juice and sugar you'll see what I mean just keep adding a little bit of lemon juice at a time until it gets thin but still running getting there I'm going to pull this on and as it sits for a little while it gets a little harder and it just so delicious on the top okay that's about right now okay watch this this is a good part just want to just make it so that it drizzles over the edge what does it look great so I'm just going to leave that to set a little bit so that's like gorgeous lemon cakes can't wait to dessert but first I'm going to make a cherry tomato salad I'll show you how easy that is it's the kind of composed salad that you can really just throw together I love the combination of tomatoes and said it's sort of a Greek combination so I thought well why not make a cherry tomato feta salad I always find people don't care with you for dinner they always remember dessert so dinner has to be good okay last tomato and the next thing is the feta Ashley would took my basil at two it's got lots of fresh herbs in it the key to the feta is to slice it but not crumble it so I'm gonna use a slicing knife just kind of slice right through it and cubes I want them about the same size of the cherry tomatoes just for the symmetry of it there are different kinds of SATA and it's really important since there are so few ingredients in this recipe that it's really good setup so there's grease SATA and French feta are really good set it I'm just going to put it right on top now and make the vinaigrette I'm not even going to bother making except religiously pour it right over that three tablespoons of white wine vinegar I use champagne vinegar and olive oils then to give it a little spiciness some red onions I chopped up and then I'm going to add fresh basil and fresh parsley and it'll be all done just toss it together my gourd is so fresh colorful and we hope delicious I'll find out in a second so good those tomatoes are wonderful into the fridge so my beach picnic is ready I'll have to do is pack everything up in Chinese takeout containers and we're ready to go time to pack up and go to the beach got beers pack up my salads so I've got this great Chinese takeout containers I'm going to put the salad in it each one goes so I'll have enough salad so each person I'll have one container of each salad lots of detainers lots of goodies okay that's trim salad I've got pasta pesto and peas I want to take this all in one big bag but it can also make small bags for each person so everybody has their own picnics pasta pesto tomatoes with feta and basil fresh parsley okay that's good next a lemon cake big six slices and take each piece and put it in a piece of parchment paper then I use this gravy you can any kind of straw or strength something natural we like all natural and tie it up like a little gift so everybody has a piece of lemon cake add and and then when they're done they can just throw all this paper ass just like that so I'm going to take these guys and wrap up chopsticks and a nice orange napkin and a big bag pack it all up and off to the beach [Applause] [Music] okay great everybody have it here or break down everybody some would be like a pasta pesto or like pasta pesto and shrimp salad mushroom filler okay and I have tomato salad with feta and everybody just sneak right in how's that oh you're not supposed to point your chopstick to somebody right is it good oh thank you it's just the perfect day on the beach or what it's unbelievably rash is that great with a little racier a little parchment paper which is you might look at a garden it's a lemon syrup it's so thin so it gets incredibly moist and of course fresh lemon juice you know so it's just wonderful we're going to let me make sure I said that in the beginning of the summer we all say oh this summer I'm going to the beach of all summer right you go to the big one and you spread wood and you drag the props in the hibachi and you go is really the way to do it why not right saving
[Music] my friend Carol Barden is coming to stay she builds the most gorgeous houses in Houston Texas she's coming too late for dinner so I'm gonna make her a special treat tonight and then tomorrow morning I've invited some friends for breakfast they're all extraordinary entrepreneurs so I think they'll get along famously when Carol arised I'm going to have a fruit and cheese tray ready this delicious homemade parmesan crackers then in the morning I'm making a decadent breakfast bread pudding with maple roasted bacon delicious roasted garlic and herb tomatoes and a sparkling pomegranate fizz drink I love having guests for breakfast the food is easy everybody's relaxed you can sit in the garden it's a great start to the day so I thought it'd be nice to have something welcoming and delicious for my friend Carol but of course it's too late to have dinner so I'm gonna make some homemade crackers parmesan and thyme crackers and a little fruit and cheese tray and then we can just hang out and catch up so the first thing I need to do for the parmesan crackers is I need 2 cups of grated Parmesan cheese okay I think I have about that it's about 3 ounces that's good enough so I'm starting with is a quarter of a pound of butter at room temperature it's already been mixed in the mixer and I'm just going to add the parmesan and then I need to add one teaspoon of thyme you can really use any kind of herbs you like but I just like the combination of parmesan in time I actually found these crackers when I was in London with a friend and there's a wonderful market called Borough Market that sets up on Saturdays it's like a real farmers market it's just wonderful everybody brings their fresh produce and I saw these crackers in the store and they come in all different kinds of cheese and herb flavors like blue cheese and rosemary and I just left these parmesan in time ones will be perfect for my friend Carol okay that should be it I'm just gonna get and I can chop it all up it's a rough chop at the time okay one teaspoon right into the mixer yeah a half a teaspoon of black pepper [Music] next thing we do is combine one and a quarter cups of flour plus a quarter teaspoon of salt just mix it together and then with the mixer on low I'm just gonna add the flour to the butter mixture let's add it slowly so it's incorporated so just like making shortbread cookies this is gonna make a log and then I'm gonna slice it into crackers and bake it this is perfect good looks beautiful it's very important for the butter to be room temperature otherwise it'll never come together it's gonna make about thirty six crackers okay just a little flour on the board roll out the dough I roll and I took about 12 or 13 inches doesn't matter exactly it really depends on how thick you want the crackers or how big you want them okay perfect I'm just gonna wrap it in plastic wrap and I'm gonna freeze it for about 30 minutes until it's really firm and then I'm gonna cut it and bake it next I'm gonna get the cheese is ready so just gonna make the cheese board now sighs some brie I was like to take the labels off cheese's hate when there's paint on a cheese board and that piece of still good English Stilton I just love so I always like to have some kind of a flat leaf and hydrangea leaves are great I'm in a classic or fig leaves but I can't really find them here in California you can just some kind of I think it really makes everything looks so much fresher and so much livelier unfortunately a hydrangea bushes in the front of my house so just sort of put them randomly it doesn't have to be perfect in fact it shouldn't be perfect it should be just random and then something green is always really important so a big bunch of grapes just right in the middle and some clementines that's important just big spots of color and dates these are really good in the jewel dates I love them I wish I put these guys right there just sort of spilling out then I'm gonna leave it in a space right here for the crackers when they come out of the oven nice knife so we can help ourselves now that can't be any easier countess it's actually great for cheese to eat room temperature so I'm just cleave in at room temperature right now so next thing I need to do is just bake the parmesan in time crackers they've been chili for about 30 minutes good thing about these guys is you can actually make them in advance and keep them in the freezer or the refrigerator and just bake them off whenever you need them I'm just gonna slice them about a quarter of an inch thick it's gonna be great with a fruit and cheese tray that's just nice to make a little something so I'm just gonna put these on a sheet tray these things don't expand like cookies they they pretty much keep their shape when you bake them so you can put them pretty close together on the sheet pan okay into the oven twenty two minutes at 350 degrees and they're gonna be golden brown Parmesan time crackers which is perfect timing because I think carols do just about them [Music] some grapes please so glad you're here I'm so glad I'm here just be able to do a little snack before you go to bed I couldn't have you just arrived and have nothing to you there little parmesan and thyme crackers that I made mmm oh this is so good with thank you nobody cooks like this for me [Music] so Carol's got her coffee I told her it's a vacation stay in bed and read while I start breakfast I'm gonna make a breakfast bread pudding it's so decadent and so delicious it's really like french toast but I'm just gonna bake it in a dish so I'm not standing at the stove making them individually so the first thing I did was cut up a hollow you can use any kind of brioche or egg bread and then I'm gonna make the custard our bread pudding is usually dessert but I'm gonna make a breakfast one with orange zest and not so much sweetness so I have 5 eggs and 2 extra egg yolks I use extra large eggs I'm gonna do two and a half cups of half-and-half that's the decadent part [Music] third of a cup of honey always think about French toast is really bread that's been dipped in a custard and so now I'm just gonna bake it with the custard actually love breakfast parties everybody so much energy in the morning and then you have the whole rest of the day to yourself why don't have teaspoons of good vanilla that's good and you make it takes even more like breakfast I'm gonna do two teaspoons of grated orange zest then I'll choose the oranges for later look I just want some cord in the morning [Music] okay that should be about two teaspoons okay the last thing is 1/2 teaspoon salt basically just making a custard but not a sweet one breakfast one whisk it all together and then while I'm do is layer the collet bread the custard and some white raisins and then I'll serve it with good maple syrup how bad could that be okay ready to assemble it so take some bread just layer it and the pan okay next thing we do is texting bolded raises just put me in between the layers and I want to have the golden raisins on the top because otherwise I'll actually burn in the oven just a handful just a little sort of it's like having raisins with your oatmeal and then we'll pour the custard over the whole thing it's gonna be so much easier than standing at the stove making french toast okay press this down just to make sure it soaks into the bread actually if you have day-old bread it's even better because a little drier it soaks up the custard better just press it down a little bit okay it's gonna learn a baking sheet let's go so for another 15 minutes and then I'm gonna bake at 350 degrees for about 55 to 60 minutes gonna be puffed and golden and gorgeous and now we need some flowers for the table [Music] forget fancy flower arrangements I really like casual ones from the garden and I have to say hydrangeas are my favorite best thing about them is they're always different I sort of start out this wonderful lime green and then they turn white and then this core just sort of hot pink color but I think this would be really gorgeous and casual front breakfast [Music] why don't we make breakfast so complicated I hate standing at the stove flipping french toast and even worse I hate having bacon in the frying pan I feel like I have to clean the kitchen afterwards so what I've devised is a way to do bacon in the oven so you take a sheet pan and a baking rack and just lay the strips of bacon on the baking pan you don't have to turn them you don't have to watch them they come at perfectly flat and I'll wrinkled up the way they do in a frying pan this is thick cut bacon you can use any kind of baked and you like to put it right on the pan okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the bacon and then I'm gonna do something really special with [Music] so with the breakfast bread pudding and the maple roasted bacon I thought I'm gonna do Gerlich and herb tomatoes I'm gonna use these wonderful grape tomatoes and he kind of cherry tomatoes great friends they'll be perfect so first I'm gonna heat up some oil about three tablespoons and chop up some garlic two cloves of garlic make it really garlicky it's kind of an odd combination of flavors but it really works well together so to make the maple a little less sweet a little more savory so one of the keys to this is you only cook the garlic too long because you don't want it to burn it has sort of a bitter taste when it burns so I'm just gonna cook it for about 30 seconds in the olive oil and then add the tomatoes and lots of fresh green herbs right into the oil well that is really fast and the garlic smells just afraid okay next with tomatoes I've two pints of cherry tomatoes these are the grape tomatoes but any kind of small tomatoes like that in the summer a lot of cherry tomatoes taste great but I find the grape tomatoes not as high season always tastes good okay let's go give him a little cross and then lots of fresh green herbs the two tablespoons of parsley [Music] it's not so good smell like garlic everywhere even is curly parsley or flat leaf parsley whatever you happened okay two tablespoons right in two tablespoons of fresh basil leaves [Music] it's going to tick up the leaves Oh get the tomatoes popping it's really nice basil just great for pungent smell so just layer them up do it Julian I think roll it up tight and just slice it [Music] just like that two tablespoons maybe a little more some fresh thyme just hold the stem I think I'll do it right into the tomato about two teaspoons of fresh thyme [Music] okay so that's the time teaspoon salt to put a pepper and this is gonna just saute away for better five to seven minutes just until the tomatoes start to burst a little bit and there's so much flavor you can just see the flavor maybe I'm low heat and that's ready so if you think oven roasted bacon is good enough white teas do this what is it about hot bacon that smells so good mmm so I'm going to take a little bit of maple syrup just put it in a dish it's got to be good maple syrup dark amber grade-a not the stuff that's maple flavored which has nothing to do with maple syrup just brush a little bit of maple syrup on each of the slices of bacon and you've got maple roasted bacon it's so good just a little bit on each one and next I'm making a pomegranate fizz to go with all this really good breakfast treat mmm back into the oven just to crisp it up it's gonna be so good with breakfast bread pudding [Music] I always want to make something special to drink for a party but can't have cocktails for breakfast so I thought I'm gonna make a pomegranate fizz which is so easy to make and so delicious it's also actually good for you so first I have pomegranate juice one of the third cups we're going to pour it all into a pitcher it's just delicious sparkling water two and a half cups we don't really have to measure it you can just pour it right into the jar it's about 1/3 and 2/3 1/3 pomegranate juice 2/3 sparkling water [Music] yeah okay little fresh lime juice about two tablespoons I suppose you could do this with champagne but I think for breakfast this would be great 1 tablespoon superfine sugar simplifying triggers great because it dissolves really quickly it's good for drinks I think I might slice a few limes just for the glasses so everybody knows it flying I just think that nice pomegranate fizz is gonna be good with the maple roasted bacon breakfast bread pudding garlic and herb tomatoes okay so nice slice lines just make sure it tastes good it's so good it's sort of tart and sweet ooh it's gonna be really good with breakfast what's a great color that's the best part I love the color isn't it great okay I skipped breakfast bread pudding out of the oven I'll be right back don't have any fun until I get back Wow that's amazing and it smells good too okay everybody breakfast bread pudding I decided I wanted to make this really decadent so I knew when Carol was coming for the night and these guys get along famously because you're interested in architecture and it's turned out okay right this is my idea of a great way to start the day I think we're all gonna have to go take a nap tomorrow you're invited back I think I'll still be here breakfast in the garden with great friends thank you I didn't Carole needs a little bit [Music]
I'm gonna make my favorite roast turkey dinner oh that's a big turkey I don't understand why our mothers used to get up at five o'clock in the morning to roast a turkey I can't figure it out I think they have this thing about bacteria a 12 pound turkey should roasted about two and a half hours and it'll be moist and delicious oh that's a beautiful bird so the first I'm gonna do is take out the giblets like the neck and the oh it's cold it's wet and I'm gonna save it for stock later and this looks beautiful and then I'm gonna Pat it dry so I'm gonna put some salt in the middle and some freshly ground pepper just make sure it's really well-seasoned we're not gonna do stuffing you know it's enough for the stuffing I'm gonna put all kinds of things in the cavity that are gonna give it lots of flavor so I'm gonna stuff it with onion forget peeling it forget just chop the whole thing up and just put it right into the inside of the turkey great and then they made big sprigs of thyme and then we're gonna have lemon I'll just put big chunks of lemon in just like that it's gonna be so delicious and then maybe the last thing is a big chunk of garlic put a big chunk of it right in the middle of the turkey and then the last thing is I'm gonna just take these little wings and tuck them under just so they're not flapping around in the pan and that they they burned before the turkeys finish cooking you're basically just doing that well the turkey it doesn't mind so I've got about four tablespoons of butter i melted in here just brush it nicely on the outside of the bird and then salt and pepper remember it's a big bird so solved it really well and some pepper in the pan so about two and a half hours at 350 degrees and we're another fabulous turkey oh love it's not look gorgeous so I'm just gonna wrap it up with a woman in foil really makes a difference if you let it rest for about 20 minutes just like the juices get into the meat the whole thing will taste fabulous I carve a turkey the same way I carve a chicken so I'll show you what I do I take the legs off looks perfectly cooked cut the dark meat a little bit okay regard the dark meat first on the side okay and then I'm going to carve the turkey breast I'm going to do is take the whole breast off actually in one piece just the way I do with a chicken it looks perfectly cooked I'm just going to slice it so much easier to do this way and I like when the slices aren't so incredibly thin that they fall apart so just like that okay maybe a sec of hair here doesn't look at that
we make uh cover which is a French chicken and wine with mushrooms and bacon the first thing I need is four ounces of bacon or pancetta I think just good smoked bacon aside put a little splash of olive oil on the pan just going to cook it for about eight to ten minutes until the bacon is really crisped okay while that cooks I'm going to get the chicken ready so what I've done is I've asked the butcher to cut a chicken up in ten pieces I'm salt and pepper it really well on both sides okay so that's salt and pepper and I think the bacon is done perfectly I want it taken out with a slotted spoon and just leave the fat that's left behind for browning the chicken just put on a big plate so the chickens going to go in I want to do it in batches so Brown's really nicely if you put too much in actually ends up steaming rather than browning I'm not cooking it completely I'm just browning it and all the flavors from the Browning we're going to get into the sauce I need half a pound of carrots I actually use really big thick slices one yellow onions two sliced into the pan one clove of garlic minced right in okay next is good stuff quarter of a cup of cognac this is going to give the flavor of the cognacs and it deglazes the pan get all those delicious crusty parts into the sauce okay now I put the chicken and the bacon all back into the pot and all the juices that select on the plate to have a bottle of Burgundy you can use Pinot Noir which is something really good that you would drink cup of chicken stock and the last thing big sprig of fresh thyme don't even pick the leaves off you can just take the stem out after it's done okay into the oven 250 degrees for just about an hour and it's going to be so good so I have a half a pound of mushrooms these are cremini you can use for Cheney the only thing you don't want to use are those sort of button mushrooms that you find the grocery store I don't have a lot of flavor so I'm just going to cook these in a little bit of butter let's get them browned these a big saute pan so they Brown nicely you don't want them to steam you want them to really steer a little bit fantastic now I'm going to the cock event out of the oven oh good okay so now I'm going to make a little bit of a roux which is flour and butter to second out so I need one and a half tablespoons of flour and 1 tablespoon of softened butter just mash it all together and then add it back into the pot and it pickins really nicely I'm just going to thicken the sauce beautifully and the last really important ingredient for cago fat little baby onion so right into the pot I'm going to add the mushrooms in actually leave the mushrooms to the last ingredient so they don't disintegrate and they're really great when they're just quickly sauteed give it a stir cook for about ten minutes so the sauce is nice and thick and take out the stems of the time y'all going to cook together so we're so good this is really this is just delicious
[Music] since we live by the water Geoffrey's always saying let's get a boat I think oh great I'm gonna learn how to sail then I'm gonna be making lunch and at the end I'm gonna be swabbing down the deck I don't think so so when my friends Barbara and Bobby Lieberman invited us on their new tugboat I thought great Oh Mike Lynch so we're starting with fresh lime daiquiris and a spicy eggplant dip with toasted pita triangles then since it's lunch on the water I'm making orzo with roasted shrimp easy to serve and a whole meal in itself and for dessert slices of a barefoot classic coconut cake just the thing for an afternoon on the water this is my idea of boating a delicious lunch with friends and somebody else's both mr. Trump adores I was great dish for crowd best part of it is the longer it sits the better it gets so the first thing to do is roast some shrimp a little olive oil salt and pepper it's actually a surprising way to cook shrimp on a sheet pan in the oven I just find it really gives it more flavor it's 2 pounds of shrimp to about 32 shrimp okay into the oven high temperature 400 degrees for exactly six minutes and they're gonna be really delicious and succulent and I think the orzo is just about ready so I cook 3/4 of a pound of orzo and going salted water with a splash of olive oil good luck whoa okay that's drained this is gonna go right into the big bowl the lemon vinaigrette the first thing you need is 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice the big lemons have a better quarter of a cup each after the other code and I have a cup of olive oil one teaspoon of pepper I just pour it right over the pasta it's gonna seem like a lot of vinaigrette but pasta really absorbs it may gives a great flavor okay I think the shrimp are ready okay so while those are cooling I'm gonna cut up some herbs and vegetables for the salad so the first thing I need is a cup of chopped scallions and then I'm just gonna run my knife right down the middle okay just rough chop the scallions and later red onions are gonna give this lots of sharp flavor right into the salad next thing is a cup of freshly chopped parsley [Music] I use flat leaf parsley I think it has more flavor but you feeling curly parsley it's just fine right it got 1 cup of fresh Dale so I'm gonna chop it roughly no it's really important to use fresh herbs especially when it's a salad like this but if you have some leftover and you want to chop it up just put it in little containers freeze it and then just defrost it when you need it okay one cup of dill right into the salad next thing is cucumbers so just run it down the middle and just do cubes so one seedless cucumber sometimes they're called English cucumbers too but whatever they're called they're delicious right into the salad I have a cup of diced red onion into it I just wanted to flavor the salad okay the next thing is the shrimp I think that perfectly cool [Music] okay all the flavor it just gonna toss it all together and then the last thing it's one of my favorite ingredients good feta and just put it in as gently as possible so it doesn't get all broken up toss it in it's perfect for sitting on the dock watching the boats contemplating life I'm gonna refrigerate it no I think I'm gonna go see if I can find some good ideas for the table I have this idea it might be fun to have a boat flag for a tablecloth and I think I've come to the right place these these look really small though oh this is an American flag why do I think it's not a good idea to put on an American flag here's he shot and said enough that looks like might be perfect I say that looks like a great tablecloth this rope is great I think be fun to tie the napkins I don't know it's a little too earthy not quite the red white and blue theme I have in mind I'll keep looking this looks like it's perfect nice white around a blue napkin I'd say that's perfect I need a few yards interesting contraption well that was an unusual shopping list I've got everything I've got my yacht ensign for tablecloth I've got rope to tie up the napkins and now I have to go home and make that coconut cake I think one of those popular recipes of all times that I've ever written with coconut cupcakes and so many people have emailed me and asked if they can make it into a cake that I rework the recipe a little bit and I'm making coconut cake so I'm gonna do for my friends today start with 3/4 of a pound of unsalted butter at room temperature need 2 cups of sugar I was gonna cream that at medium speed until it's really light and fluffy okay I'm low speed I'm just gonna add these one at a time until they're incorporated okay extra large one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract turn them to low so I'm not wearing the vanilla one and a half teaspoons of pure almond extract okay now for the dry ingredients so first I need three cups of flour just fluff it up first and then carefully scoop it just level it off I always put it through a sifter it combines the leavening ingredients and the flour and salt but it also make sure that there's no little pieces in it one teaspoon baking powder half a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt just dip them all together in a cloud flour okay perfect now what I'm gonna do isn't it for a cup of milk I'm going to add the milk and the dry ingredients ultimately to the batter starting and ending with the flour so about a quarter of the flour a third of the milk this keeps the batter nice and light blend really well another quarter of the flour my friends Barbara and Bobby live about a half an hour away from me very convenient it was like just fold the batter because I think bottom of the bowl never gets as well mixed as the top does I just want to make sure it's well mixed okay four ounces of coconut you can really find it in any grocery store just fold it in carefully I've got two 9-inch cake pans priest and floured and half an H okay let's go slow this out so these are gonna bake 350 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes then I'm gonna do a cream cheese frosting yeah the coconut cakes are cool they smell so good and now it's my cream cheese frosting for it so the first thing I need is a pound of cream cheese it needs to meet room temperature so you can make it nice and smooth have a pound of butter it is frosting after all I'm just gonna mix it together you don't want to whip it just stir it together I'm gonna add a pound of sifted confectioner sugar I've already sifted this just add it slowly yeah okay and then some flavorings 3/4 of a teaspoon of good vanilla extract quarter of a teaspoon of almond extract just a drop and just mix that until it's smooth mmm okay I'm just gonna put it on the cake okay so the two cakes I'm going to do one upside down so we have a flat surface for the second cake let's put some frosting right in the middle it's like one big coconut cupcake okay another second where if you want a cake that's a little old-fashioned I put it right side up so it's a little rounded on the top if you want it more elegant so it's flat you put it bottom side up so it's very flat but this is an old-fashioned cake so I'm gonna do it this way sometimes with the chocolate ganache cake I do it upside down mm-hmm this looks great okay more icing so I'm gonna ice the entire cake and then we're gonna dust the whole outside with coconut okay so I usually do the sides first just easier just do this very gently you don't want any crumbs in the icing but remember the coconuts gonna hide any imperfections now that doesn't look bad at all does it and the last touch is coconut we're gonna take the shredded coconut and just press it on the sides the icing soft enough so it'll hold it about 6 ounces of coconut so all together there's about 4 ounces in the cake and 6 ounces on top so you need about 10 ounces of coconut so that's a coconut cake yes I'm gonna make roasted eggplant dip and we have with drinks on the dock I thought it'd be really great to have some roasted eggplant dip with our daiquiri sitting out on the dock bar burn Bobby I think it's me fantastic so it's a fairly simple process maybe like 1-inch chunks I've already done one this is the second one so two eggplants so the next thing is red onion one red onion also in chunks just dress them all together one red pepper also one inch cubes and this is really rough cuz in the end it's gonna get pureed I just find things have the most flavor when you roast them with olive oil salt and pepper really just gets into the vegetable or whatever it is the meat whatever you're making okay to close the garlic minced right on top Olive Oyl three tablespoons of olive oil why don't have teaspoons of salt a lot depends on how big the eggplants are half a teaspoon of pepper and a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper give it a little heat I thought you want to measure you don't want it too hot okay I'm just gonna clean hands just toss it all together and then I'm gonna roast it at a high temperature 400 degrees for 45 minutes and the onion and the eggplant and the garlic it's all gonna be so sweet and delicious [Music] and people start talking about things like tablescapes it makes me crazy I like a really nice table but it's got to be fairly something simple and something I can do so I'm just gonna take since we're doing the nautical theme although we take a nice basic bright blue napkin and with this great white rope that I got it's sailing rope I'm just gonna make some kind of a knot that's it I'm not much of a sailor so oh that looks like it been sailing that right perfect I'm just gonna cut it off now I know where this good sailing rope it's hard to cut I think that looks great so I need to make six of these so if I can do that again perfect I'm gonna need a curry after this I'll make a sailor out of me yet tips and is already so the vegetables are cool for the rest of eggplant dip I'm just gonna have a few things two tablespoons of lemon juice 2 tablespoons of tahini which is a sesame seed paste has great flavor for this too and I'm just gonna puree it until it's really chunky I don't like it when it's too smooth perfect we're gonna mix it in with some fresh parsley I'm gonna serve it with pita bread who wouldn't like that some fresh parsley me about three tablespoons it just gives it a little fresh color and flavor one of the things I never do it at a party to serve like a million hors d'oeuvres one really nice thing with a drink is all anybody wants okay right in say what a difference it makes it's really nice some kind of Farish herb okay into the ball take maybe a little garnish he said parsley it's gonna be really good with a daiquiri but then what wouldn't be good with a daiquiri I know they're all these fancy drinks between the sheets I never know what they are I like the classics I thought boats the Caribbean it's got to be run based drink why is it most cocktail recipes making one cocktail who drinks one cocktail I'm having a party I'm gonna make a lot of daiquiris so the first thing I need is two cups of rum good dark rum and need lots of fresh lime juice I need one and a half cups right the only other ingredient is sugar syrup and they have 2/3 of a cup of sugar syrup what it is is a cup of sugar and a cup of water that I cooked together until the sugar dissolved it's very often using drinks just mix it all together and then later I'm gonna shake it up with ice really good daiquiris but for transporting to the party right into a quart container whoa just made it okay that's ready to go now I have to just pack up everything else and we have a party all right Barbie you don't get it thank you so much for this gorgeous setting oh my god I can't wait to get on the so tell me what's in this again or should I plant peppers garlic okay okay right there so I'm waiting they're very patient you know one big trouble okay what don't you get I'm just gonna have a really big piece she works it off thinking about India okay everybody take a plate in your spoon Anchors Away I can't wait to start eating but the day doesn't get any better the company doesn't get any better okay Bobby can we keep going how about all the way to Paris we're not coming back
[Music] Barbara why Beth is my assistant and dear friend her daughter Cassandra is not only gorgeous but she's a competitive beach volleyball player I thought it'd be fun for Barbara and me to take a picnic down to the beach and watch them play for Barbara and me I'm making sweet and spicy curry chicken wraps containers of panzanella an Italian vegetable salad with toasted bread cubes and I'm sending Cassandra to the beach with peanut butter and jelly bars for all the volleyball players to give them energy I've never been one for going to the beach and lying in the Sun but for a picnic with Barbara and a volleyball game I'm willing to get a little sand in my shoes at one time or another we've all thought it was a good idea to cook at the beach it's not little gust of wind sand in your food so I'm gonna make a picnic for Barbara and me where everything's made in advance and sauce served at room temperature first thing is courage chicken max first thing I do is roast chicken and what I've got is chicken breast on the bone for the skin still on I've tried it a million different ways it's the best way to make cooked chicken for salad rub a little olive oil on the top whoa got a lot just a little sprinkle with salt and pepper into the oven 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and a semi tender and juicy I wasn't a--make a dessert that tasted like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I thought cookies no peanut butter and jelly bars and I made them and people went crazy so I thought it'd be fun to give to Cassandra to take down to the beach for her friends maybe everyone leftover for Barbara and me so I'll show you how to make the first thing is you need of course I have two kind of butter getting a bad reputation here one and a half cups of sugar but this is like a shortbread with peanut butter in it and jelly in the middle so cream together the butter and sugar be sure to use room-temperature butter it makes all the difference in the world when you're baking I just beat it for a minute until it's light and fluffy and then on a low speed add two eggs one at a time he's gonna vanilla and 18 ounces of peanut butter yikes okay now for the dry ingredients three cups of flour one teaspoon of baking powder and one and a half of salt just sit down all together so it's really as simple as making shortbread okay with a mixer on low just slowly put the dry ingredients into the wet ones or should I say the dry ingredients in the peanut ones Oh in a cloud of flour okay that looks great yeah it's like one big peanut butter cookie clear the decks I'd go ten then I greased and floured I put a little parchment paper on the bottom so I'm gonna take 2/3 of the dough and just Pat it on the bottom the flour has a little bit and just Pat this out into the bottom of the pan and came back with a sham part got 18 absence of jam which is about one and a half cups smells like a PB&amp;J sandwich another six ounces so we have 18 ounces altogether just spread it evenly over the peanut butter shortbread layer and now comes the fun part [Music] peanut butter crumble on the top so take the shortbread and just little pieces of dough just drop them across the top doesn't have to touch when it bakes it all go together just sort of crumble it evenly on top and then we put nuts on top peanuts I'll give it a crunch so it's creamy it's sweet it's peanut e and it's crunchy I think in that bag very casual okay let's sprinkle the top with chopped peanuts salted peanuts are really good these are gonna bake 350 degrees for 45 minutes and you wouldn't believe how good they are [Music] chicken should be done for the curried chicken wraps way you can tell is by pressing if it's really firm to the touch it's done so I'm just going to let this cool I'm gonna go shopping for ingredients for my panzanella what you see this so I've done some cooking in a must to the market to get vegetables my panzanella and the curved chicken rafts nice thing about a small town is markets not so far away so sometimes I come to the produce market it's sort of the equivalent of standing the refrigerator door looking for inspiration just looking for something that would be great I'm making curried chicken wraps in a tortilla and you know I think might be nice a little bit of celery for a crunch would be good and a little scallion for a little bite that'd be good too the next thing on a neck is panzanella which is like a chunky vegetable salad with toasted cubes of bread and vinaigrette all over it it's so good and I'm gonna get some red peppers that looks like a nice firm one some yellow peppers that's a pretty one you want really firm things that if their wrinkly they've been around too long these are gorgeous and the last thing I want is on some cucumbers now you can get these regular cucumbers these are sort of a garden variety cucumbers but they're a little bit bitter and I find that skin very tough the ones I love are called hot house or seedless cucumbers and they're very thin-skinned they're absolutely delicious and they have very little seeds and they're sweet would be so good in the panzanella hi how are you good gorgeous day thanks so much bye that's gonna be great salad peanut-butter-and-jelly bars are baked and cooled what you see them not look amazing Cassandra and her friends are gonna go crazy so glad I'm going to pack them up and send them to the beach and had to be something beachy so I thought I'd wrap them all in parchment and send them in a little beach pail too cute right into the pail there's six of them so we make sure I get six and I think that's the sander perfect timing so y'all ready for the game I'm ready I've got some snacks for you come on through eight so look what I made for you made a beach pail filled with peanut butter bar and jelly bar says what's in there siliceous your little place I done I think we can probably fudge one right here nobody'll ever know so sick peanut butter shortbread with raspberry jam delicious and napkins for the beach and I'll see you the beach thank you can't wait to watch you play volleyball I'll see you there okay bye Cassandra I've never since she was five aren't you incredibly lovely I can't wait to see her play volleyball she's amazing [Music] so the chickens cooked for the chicken curry wraps and I have to make the sauce one and a half cups of mayonnaise use good mayonnaise it makes such a difference third of a cup of white wine that'll thin it and give it a better texture and flavor quarter of a cup of chutney Korean chutney is a classic combination and three tablespoons of good curry powder you know they're all different kinds of curry powder is actually assortment of spices some are spicy or some are sweeter I like a sweet one someone can put three tablespoons in but it depends on what kind of curry powder you use so maybe start with two and then add more 1/2 teaspoons of salt already smells good I love curry and chutney together looks good so now I'm going to show you how I do chicken you can cut it up for chicken sound lots of different ways I can dice it but I find for something like the rafts if you shred the chicken it actually catches more of the sauce it's better in a wrap so I'm just gonna take the skin off and then just with your fingers just pull the meat away from the bone I wanna make sure they're cool enough so you can handle them and then just start shredding it you can see that the chickens really moist makes such a difference instead of boiling chicken for salad to roast it like that really keeps the texture and the flavor I'm gonna pour on the sauce few more ingredients chopped up some two stalks of celery get some crunch and two scallions give it a little heat and a quarter of a cup of raisins these are all the topics that you'd normally have when curry and later I'm gonna add roasted cashews so I'll put this in the fridge until the flavors blend really well and then I'm gonna make panzanella which is this delicious Italian salad with bread - snack I brought some peanut butter and jelly bars strawberry jelly my favorite man is a Campina butter cookie almost we got the peanuts on the top like chunky peanut butter it's good stuff I actually didn't make me buy tomato you guys gonna play another game Esther Leslie mater yeah proof of the beach can be tricky sometimes you want something's really easy to eat that can be served at room temperature my assistant Barbara and I are going to the beach and I'm gonna take panzanella which she loves and I think I'll serve it those Chinese takeout containers first thing we do is heat up some oil and then toast break cubes in it Italians made up the salad to use leftover bread so it's a great way to use it if it's a little bit dry it's even better really sucks up the vinaigrette big chunks the first time Barbara and I tested this recipe we we decided any salad that has bread cubes dipped in vinaigrette was just fine with us I think we actually ate around the vegetables okay oils hot sauce in the bread cubes little salt tell them around they're all a little bit of oil and while those toasts I'm gonna make a nice garlic vinaigrette for the salad can't make garlic vinaigrette with that one clove of garlic I need a bad teaspoon it should be just right okay so about a teaspoon of garlic right into the bowl half a teaspoon of good Dijon mustard three tablespoons if I use champagne vinegar you can use any good white wine vinegar half a cup of good olive oil mustard will actually multiply the vinaigrette which is nice Pepa teaspoon of salt quarter of teaspoon of pepper and that's the vinaigrette so next is getting vegetables ready the first thing is the cucumber I really like seedless cucumbers they're called English or hothouse cucumbers just right off the ends cut it in half and then with a small spoon or a tea spoon just take out the seeds like it's called seedless but it has a few seeds but it's so much less bitter than regular American cucumbers it's just really a knife right down the middle what this a really chunky salad you don't want it finely chopped so I already have red peppers yellow peppers and red onions thinly sliced I got chunky cucumbers this is gonna make a lot of sound and the longer it sits the better it tastes okay that's the cucumbers got tomatoes these are good Israeli tomatoes so big chunky slices of tomato it's a really casual salad okay so into a bowl [Music] my grades so colorful okay then I'm going to add some capers about three tablespoons fresh basil okay comes the good part croutons and it perfectly toasted great warm croutons vinaigrette [Music] don't smell so good on crouton from the vinaigrette are so good together in the vegetables basil capers that's gonna be really good at the beach and Bart was going to be thrilled [Music] the things that I put in the curry salad are things that are traditionally served with curry raisins chutney and caffeine think about cashews is sometimes they've been sitting around in the package for a while so I always like to dry sautee them just for a few minutes to crisp them up a little bit I want salted roasted cashews just heat them in a dry pan until they're warm through wouldn't believe what a difference it hasn't flavor even when I'm just serving cashews with drinks I hate them up like this so when these are done I'm gonna finish the chicken salad put it in the wrap and we're off to the beach so the last thing I have to add to the chicken salad before I put them in the wraps is salted roasted cashews I chopped them up I thought they'd be easier to eat in a wrap this looks pretty good that's a lot here so I'm gonna make a wrap one each for Barbara and me sure how this works just big spoon of chicken sound right in the middle I'm gonna fold the ends in and then roll the whole thing up oh just like that I'm just gonna cut it in half everything's and one more you really do this with any kind of salad just fold the ends in and wrap it up around this chicken salad how great that works hack it up not even the sand can get in there now at panzanella peanut-butter-and-jelly bars stay and we're ready to go to the beach [Music] hi Barbara how are they doing they're doing great who's winning uh well it's kind of going back and forth this is my kind of sport sitting here watching them play really let them jump up and down you want a live one oh I'd love to have a napkin wonderful oh what a pretty color my favorite is that biddeth and their favorite Chinese takeout containers perfect very chicken rounds and delicious that's a pen Camilla lots of bread stuffing vinaigrette oh they look wonderful oh this is good these are the bread right Chloe the breads Oh delicious chef Michael retested this recipe we had all that bread keep it holy I'm the only thing that was lots of the cucumbers and tomatoes and peppers let's try some bisque I'm so glad that you did you think we got enough exercise we can eat the peanut butter and jelly bars yeah so if I'm going to pack them up and send them to the beach it had to be something beachy so I thought I'd wrap them all in parchment and send them in a little beach pail to cute [Music] [Applause] right into the tail are six of us only make sure I get six and I think that's the Sandra perfect so you're ready for the game I'm ready I've got some snacks for you come down through eight so look what I made for you made a beach tail filled with peanut butter bar and jelly bar says what's in there Celeste has one little place I think we can probably fudge one right here nobody'll ever know so sick peanut butter shortbread with raspberry jam it's delicious and napkins for the beach and I'll see you the beach thank you can't wait to watch her play volleyball I'll see you there okay bye Cassandra I've known her since she was five Moochie incredibly lovely I can't wait to see you play volleyball she's amazing so the chickens cooked for the chicken curry wraps and I have to make the sauce once a sudden for something that would be great I'm making curried chicken wraps in a tortilla and no I think might be nice a little bit of celery for crunch would be good and little scallion for a little bite that'll be good too the next thing on the neck is panzanella which is like a chunky vegetable salad with toasted cubes of bread and vinaigrette all over it it's so good and I'm gonna get some red peppers that looks like a nice firm one some yellow peppers that's a pretty one you want really firm things that if their wrinkly they've been around too long these are gorgeous and the last thing I want is on some cucumbers now you can get these regular cucumbers these are sort of a garden variety cucumbers but they're a little bit bitter and I find that skin very tough the ones I love are called hothouse or Cephas cucumbers and they're very thin-skinned they're absolutely delicious and they have very little seeds and they're sweet would be so good in panzanella hi how are you good or just dead make so much by this would be great salad peanut butter and jelly bars are baked and cooled what you see them not look amazing out here so I'm gonna make a wrap one each for Barbara and me sure how this works just big spoon of chicken salad right in the middle I'm gonna fold the ends in and then roll the whole thing up oh just like that I'm just gonna cut it in half how great things and one more you can really do this with any kind of salad just fold the ends in and wrap it up around this chicken salad how great that works hack it up not even the saying can get in there now grab panzanella peanut-butter-and-jelly bars stay and we're ready to go to the beach [Music] you hi Farber how are they doing they're doing great who's winning uh well it's kind of going back and forth my con is for sitting here watching them play Kali welcome jump up and down eat that can be served at room temperature my assistant Barbara and I are going to the beach and I'm gonna take panzanella which she loves and I think I'll serve it in those Chinese takeout containers first thing we do is heat up some oil and then toast break cubes in it Italians made up the skala to use leftover bread so it's a great way to use it if it's a little bit dry it's even better really sucks up the vinaigrette big chunks the first time Barbara and I tested this recipe we we decided any salad that has bread cubes dipped in vinaigrette was just fine with us I think we actually ate around the vegetables okay oils hot just tossing the bread cubes no salt tell them round they're all a little bit of oil and while those toasts I'm gonna make a nice garlic vinaigrette for the salad can't make garlic vinaigrette with that one clove of garlic I need a bad teaspoon it should be just right okay so about a teaspoon of garlic right into the bowl half a teaspoon of the Dijon mustard three tablespoons of I use champagne vinegar you can use any good white wines and then on a low speed add two eggs one at a time he's put a vanilla and 18 ounces of peanut butter yikes okay now for the dry ingredients three cups of flour one teaspoon of baking powder and one and a half of salt just sift that all together so it's really as simple as making shortbread okay with a mixer on low just slowly put the dry ingredients into the wet ones or should I say the dry ingredients in the peanut ones go in a cloud of flour okay that looks great yeah it's like one big peanut butter cookie the other decks I've got pan that I've greased and floured right is the tail there's six of those I'll make sure I get six and I think that's the sander perfect so you all ready for the game I'm ready I've got some snacks for you come on through eight so look what I made for you made a beach tail filled with peanut butter bar and jelly bar says what's in there Celeste has little toys I think we can probably fudge one right here nobody'll ever know so sick peanut butter short bit with raspberry jam delicious and napkins for the beach and I'll see you the beach thank you the cableway to watch a play volleyball I'll see you there okay bye Cassandra I've known her since she was five be incredibly lovely I can't wait to see her play volleyball she's amazing so the chickens cooked for the chicken curry wraps now I have to make the sauce one and a half cups of mayonnaise use good mayonnaise it makes such a difference third of a cup of white wine that'll thin it and give it a better texture and flavor to sort of crumble it evenly on top and then I'm going to put nuts on top peanuts I'll give it a crunch so it's creamy it's sweet it's peanutty and it's crunchy a bit can that be very casual okay let's sprinkle the top of chopped peanuts salted peanuts are really good these are gonna bake 350 degrees for 45 minutes and you wouldn't believe how good they are [Music] chicken should be done for the courage kickin wraps way you can tell is by pressing if it's really firm to the touch it's done so I'm just going to let this cool I'm gonna go shopping for ingredients for my panzanella wait you see this so I've done some cooking and I'm off to the market to get vegetables to my panzanella and the Kurd chicken rest less thing about a small town is markets not so far away so sometimes I come to the produce market it's sort of the equivalent of standing the refrigerator door looking for inspiration just looking for something that would be great I'm making curried chicken wraps in a tortilla and you know I think might be nice a little bit of celery for a crunch would be good and a little scallion for a little bite that'll be good too the next thing I'm gonna make is panzanella which is like a chunky vegetable salad with toasted cubes of bread and vinaigrette all over it it's so good and I'm gonna get some red peppers that looks like a nice firm one some yellow peppers that's a pretty one you want really firm things that if their wrinkly they've been around too long these are gorgeous and the last thing I want is some some cucumbers now you can get these regular cucumbers these are sort of a garden-variety cucumbers but they're a little bit bitter and I find the skin very tough the ones I love are called hothouse or Cephas cucumbers and they're very thin-skinned they're absolutely delicious and they have very little seeds and they're sweet would be so good in the panzanella hi how are you good or just dead thanks so much bye that's gonna be great salad peanut-butter-and-jelly bars are baked and cooled what you see them not look amazing Cassandra and her friends are gonna go crazy so if I'm going to pack them up and send them to the beach it had to be something beachy so I thought I'd wrap them all in parchment and send them in a little beach pail too cute right here's the pail there's six of them so we make sure I get six and I think that's the sander perfect timing so you all ready for the game I'm ready I've got some snacks for you come on through eight so look what I made for you I made a beach tail filled with peanut butter bar and jelly bar says what's in there siliceous your little place I think we can probably fudge one right here nobody'll ever know so sick peanut butter shortbread with raspberry jam delicious and napkins for the beach and I'll see you the beach thank you can't wait to watch you play volleyball I'll see you there okay bye Cassandra I've never said she was five Moochie incredibly lovely I can't wait to see her play volleyball she's amazing [Music] so the chickens cooked for the chicken curry wraps now I have to make the sauce one and a half cups of mayonnaise use good mayonnaise it makes such a difference third of a cup of white wine that'll thin it and give it a better texture and flavor quarter of a cup of chutney Korean chutney is a classic combination and three tablespoons of good curry powder you know they're all different kinds of curry powder is actually assortment of spices some are spicier summer sweeter I like a sweet one someone can put three tablespoons in but it did [Music] Barbara live F is my assistant and dear friend her daughter Cassandra is not only gorgeous but she's a competitive beach volleyball player I thought it'd be fun for Barbara and me to take a picnic down to the beach and watch them play for Barbara and me I'm making sweet and spicy curry chicken wraps containers of panzanella an Italian vegetable salad with toasted bread cubes and I'm sending Cassandra to the beach with peanut butter and jelly bars for all the volleyball players to give them energy I've never been one for going to the beach and lying in the Sun for a picnic with Barbara and a volleyball game I'm willing to get a little sand in my shoes at one time or another we've all thought it was a good idea to cook at the beach it's not little gust of wind sand in your food so I'm gonna make a picnic for Barbara and me but everything's made in advance and it's all served at room temperature first thing is curried chicken max first thing I do is roast chicken and when I've got his chicken breasts on the bone with the skin still on I've tried it a million different ways it's the best way to make cooked chicken for salad rub a little olive oil on the top woman a lot just a little sprinkle with salt and pepper into the oven 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and it'll be tender and juicy I always wanted to make a dessert that tasted like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I thought cookies no peanut butter and jelly bars and I made them and people went crazy so I thought it'd be fun to give to Sandra to take down to the beach for her friends maybe everyone left over for Barbara and made so I'll show you how to make them the first thing is you need of course they have to kind of butter getting bad reputation here one and a half cups of sugar but this is like a shortbread with peanut butter in it and jelly in the middle so cream together the butter and sugar be sure to use room-temperature butter it makes all the difference in the world when you're baking and just beat it for a minute till it's light and fluffy and then on a low speed add two eggs one at a time he's gonna vanilla and 18 ounces of peanut butter yikes okay now for the dry ingredients three cups of flour one teaspoon of baking powder and one and a half of salt just sift that all together so it's really as simple as making shortbread okay with a mixer on low just slowly put the dry ingredients into the wet ones or should I say the dry ingredients in the peanut ones go in a cloud of flour okay that looks great yeah it's like one big peanut butter cookie the other Dex I've got pan that I greased and floured and put a little parchment paper on the bottom so I'm gonna take 2/3 of the dough and just Pat it on the bottom the flour may is a little bit and just Pat this out into the bottom of the pan and came up with a sham card that 18 ounces of jam which is about one and a half cups smells like a PB&amp;J sandwich from the other six ounces so we have 18 ounces altogether just spread it evenly over the peanut butter shortbread layer and now comes the fun part [Music] peanutbutter crumble on the top so take the short bread and just little pieces of dough just drop them across the top doesn't have to touch when it bakes it all go together [Music] okay that's the cucumbers got Tomatoes these are good Israeli Tomatoes so big chunky slices of tomato it's a really casual salad okay so into a bowl [Music] that grade is so colorful okay then I'm going to add some capers about three tablespoons fresh basil okay that puts the good part croutons and it's perfectly toasted great warm croutons vinaigrette [Music] it smell so good on kuttappan with vinegars are so good together in the vegetable base on capers that's gonna be really good at the beach kinvaras going to be thrilled [Music] you [Music] the things that I put in the curry salad are things that are traditionally served with curry raisins chutney and caffeine think about cashews is sometimes they've been sitting around in the package for a while so I always like to dry sautee them just for a few minutes to crisp them up a little bit I want salted roasted cashews just heat them in a dry pan until they're warm through wouldn't believe what a difference it hasn't flavor even when I'm just serving cashews with drinks I hate them up like this so when these are done I'm gonna fish the chicken salad put it in the wrap and we're off to the beach so the last thing I have to add to the chicken salad before I put them in the wraps is salted roasted cashews I chopped them up I thought they'd be easier to eat and a wrap this looks pretty good that's a lot here so I'm gonna make a wrap one each for Barbara and me sure how this works this big spoon of chicken sound right in the middle I'm gonna fold the ends in and then roll the whole thing up oh just like that I'm just going to cut it in half everything's and one more you really do this with any kind of salad just fold the ends in and wrap it up around this chicken salad how great that works hack it up not even the sand can get in there now at panzanella peanut-butter-and-jelly bars stay and we're ready to go to the beach you hi Barbara how are they doing I bet you want great who's winning uh well it's kind of going back and forth like on sports sitting here watching them play really let them jump up and down you want a will one oh I'd love to have a nap any wonderful oh what a pretty color my favorite is that it is and our favorite Chinese takeout containers perfect creaking and round and delicious that's a pendulum lots of bread stuffing vinaigrette oh they look wonderful oh this is good these are the bread right slowly the bread Oh delicious level retested this recipe we had all that bread keep it holy I'm the only thing that was lots of the cucumbers and tomatoes and peppers let's try some fish I'm so glad that you did you think we got enough extra sauce you can eat the peanut butter and jelly bars yeah so if I'm gonna pack them up and send them to the beach it had to be something beachy so I thought I'd wrap them all up ends on what kind of curry powder you use so maybe start with two and then add more one and a half teaspoons of salt already smells good I love curry and chutney together looks good so now I'm gonna show you how I do chicken you can cut it up for chicken sound lots of different ways I can dice it but I find for something like the wraps if you shred the chicken it actually catches more of the sauce it's better in a wrap so just gonna take the skin off and then just with your fingers just pull the meat away from the bone I wanna make sure they're cool enough so you can handle them and then just start shredding it you can see that the chickens really moist makes such a difference instead of boiling chicken for salad to roast it like that really keeps the texture and the flavor we pour on the sauce [Music] few more ingredients captain two stalks of celery get some crunch and two scallions give a little heat and a quarter of a cup of raisins these are all the topics that you'd normally have on curry and later I'm gonna add roasted cashews so we'll put this in the fridge until the flavors blend really well and then I'm gonna make panzanella which is this delicious Italian salad with bread it's not a snack I brought some peanut butter and jelly bars strawberry jelly my favorite and this list has a Campina butter cookie almost we got the peanuts in the top like chunky peanut butter it's good stuff I actually didn't make me buy tomato here's our pay another game after this lesson we like you know proof of the beach can be tricky sometimes you want something's really easy to eat that can be served at room temperature my assistant Barbara and I are going to the beach and I'm gonna take panzanella which she loves and I think I'll serve it in those Chinese takeout containers first thing we do is heat up some oil and then toast break cubes in it Italians made up the Scala to use leftover bread so it's a great way to use it if it's a little bit dry it's even better really sucks up the vinaigrette big chunks the first time Barbara and I tested this recipe we we decided any salad that has bread cubes dipped in vinaigrette was just fine with us I think we actually ate around the vegetables ok oils hot just sauce in the bread cubes no salt tell them around they're all a little bit of oil and while those toasts I'm gonna make a nice garlic vinaigrette for the salad can't make garlic vinaigrette with that one clove of garlic I need a bad teaspoon it should be just right okay so about a teaspoon of garlic right into the ball 1/2 a teaspoon of good Dijon mustard 3 tablespoons of I use champagne vinegar you can use any good white wine vinegar 1/2 a cup of good olive oil mustard will actually multiply the vinaigrette which is nice Pepa teaspoon of salt quarter of teaspoon of pepper and that's the vinaigrette so next is getting vegetables ready the first thing is the cucumber I really like seedless cucumbers they're called English or hothouse cucumbers just cut off the ends cut it in half and then with a small spoon or a teaspoon just take out the seeds like what's called seedless but it has a few seeds but so much less bitter than regular American cucumbers it's just when a knife right down the middle want this a really chunky salad you don't want it finely chopped so I already have red peppers yellow peppers and red onions thinly sliced I got chunky cucumbers this is gonna make a lot of sound and the longer it sits the better it tastes Parshin and send them in a little beach pail too cute right into the pail or six of those will make sure I get six and I think that's the Sandra perfect so you all ready for the game I'm ready I've got some snacks for you come on through eight so look what I made for you made a beach tail filled with peanut butter bar and jelly bar says what's in there Celeste has a little toast I think we can probably fudge one right here nobody'll ever know so so peanut butter shortbread with raspberry jam delicious and napkins for the beach and I'll show you the beach thank

oils hot just tossing the bread cubes no salt
[Music] my friend jack is a fabulous realtor but kind of an inexperienced cook he has some dear friends that he's going to take on a food tour at the Hamptons so we made a plan together I owe him a huge favor so I've offered to make them sandwiches for the beach and a light supper for after the tour I think I'm gonna use a lot of local ingredients from my cooking for lunch I'm making them filet of beef sandwiches with a mustard horseradish sauce that has a real kick for dinner a seafood salad made from shellfish from Montauk and a zesty lemon vinaigrette and for dessert a plum raspberry crumble with local fruit and a crisp oatmeal and almond topping after their tour of the Hamptons and some delicious meals I hope they'll love this place as much as I do [Music] so the first thing I'm going to do for Jack and his friends is make filet beef sandwich with horseradish sauce so I have a half a fillet of beef and we sleep great seasoning on the outside the first thing I want to do is make a a butter you need to use room-temperature butter and mix it with about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard so I'm just going to mash this together a little bit the whole thing about beef is just make sure you get lots of flavor in it thinking about making sandwiches is you can make it with anything that you use as a main course loin of pork with chutney filet beef with horseradish sauce so I'm going to take that have a filet of beef and Pat it dry with paper towels which ensures that the butter is going to stick to it and then all the butter and mustard on the outside this is time to use your hands if you don't mind having messy hands just rub the outside make sure the filet abuse stays really moist when you roast it could have roasted a very high temperature so I want to make sure it's really sort of crusty on the outside and moist on the inside and this ensures that that happens I always like to use the seasonings in the coating that I'm using in the sauce oh there's mustard in the horseradish sauce and it's nice on the filet beef to have two tablespoon of kosher salt just do it really evenly it seems like a lot of salt but remember it's the only flavoring it's really important 1/2 a tablespoon of cracked pepper really evenly over it okay I'm going to roast it at 500 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes so into the oven it's going to be just brown and crusty on the outside and succulent and juicy inside and then I'm going to make sandwiches with horseradish and mustard sauce so the first thing I need is 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise I just want this to be really flavorful cells for because of a cup of mayonnaise 1/2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard because I like something to look like what it tastes like half a tablespoon of coarse grain mustard and then for a little heat have a tablespoon of horseradish prepared horseradish I should do it two tablespoons of sour cream and just a pinch of salt I'll just mix it together so that's a really easy sauce for filet beef and I smell it I think it's done wow that's perfectly cooked alright let's just test it with Ali thermometer you want to be 120 degrees with an instant meat thermometer it's really easy to do I nailed it okay now I'm going to cover it with aluminum foil so I'm just going to let it rest for about 15 minutes and all the juices get back into the meat that's gonna make a delicious sandwich so Jack and his friends are on their trip I hope they made it can be Cox dairy and what kind of cheeses is hard this one is called macaques sunrise yes I named it because of the color beautiful it's so good we should bring some to Hina yeah so this via connect that thank you are good to see you good to see you enjoy the cheese country symbols with sandwiches Blasi horseradish sauce love this bread cuz it's just filled with all kinds of grains and you can see oatmeal in it and wonderful that's so much flavor I always put a little bit of room temperature butter on the bottom it really creates a little bit of a barrier so it keeps the bread moist okay the next thing is mustard horseradish sauce don't neglect the corners I'm gonna make sure every bite has must leave horseradish sauce in it okay now I've got a Rugel I just think it's a really nice peppery flavor with with beef so it's gonna be that's great good at rubella so I'm gonna put a little bit of a bed of arugula on it don't was nice to have something crunchy in a sandwich it can be basil leaves it can be really tender lettuce okay and now the filet beef perfectly done because it's been resting well the resting really makes a huge difference it just cooks all the way through without getting overcooked on the outside and okay and then just a tiny bit of butter on the last slice for the same reason just keep the moisture in that's a really nice hearty sandwich they're gonna love it [Music] well you got the perfect date [Applause] hi Lois so you're going on a grand tour of the Hamptons set the day what do you do we're gonna go to the beach oh oh I've got sandwiches for you filleting before--the radish oh that's okay for the beach and we have something for you and you did we've got your cheesy text a dairy right down the street I love our vanilla isn't that great credible I know cows have a great time we're not gonna come listen somebody's got to work oh come back I'm gonna do a whole dinner with Long Island ingredients for you boy okay oh yeah you're a good guy no that's the dirty secret have a wonderful time with you hurry back oh nice cheese I found some gorgeous plums at the farm since I've got to be nice to make a plum raspberry crumble it's like two pounds of plums I've just pitted them and I'm gonna slice them into 1 inch wedges I actually love making crumbles I really prefer to cake I just love good cooked fruit desserts in a big bowl there's a cup of sugar and 1/4 of a cup of flour that's what makes the goo so delicious about two tablespoons of fresh orange juice and the last thing is a half-pint of fresh raspberries I'm just gonna toss that all together just toss it carefully you don't want to bruise the raspberries too much and a lot depends on how much juice there isn't the fruit if it's very very juicy fruit and I want to add a little bit more flour okay you know the dish it's great in the winter I make apple and pear crumbles in the summer peach raspberry this time of the year the plums are really good so they're perfect okay now I'm gonna make an oatmeal crumble topping with almonds it's delicious so start with a cup of flour third a cup of sugar white sugar and I use 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar two things gives a nice sort of rich flavor lightly packed quarter teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor I need a quarter stick of butter and I've actually already cut it up so it's stayed nice and cold just put it right into the food processor and then I'm just going to process it until the butter is like the size of peas okay the butters done just going to put this in a bowl with half a cup of oatmeal you want to use good old-fashioned oats not quick cooking or instant and have a cup of almonds I like the blanched sliced almonds it's a really good flavor with the plums I'm just going to take my hands and just we're up this together until it makes big crumbles sometimes these are called crisps but I'm calling it a crumble okay right on the top spread it out evenly so the fruit is all covered it's going to bake 350 degrees for about 40 minutes and so the food is all bubbly and delicious and tender into the up okay that's it for dessert I hope the guys are enjoying that lunch at the beach we have a deeply wonderful how's the sandwich it's a vicious really delicious and we're only halfway through the tour it's a good thing we have some nourishment what else do I plan Jack it's a big secret but it'll be fun I'm not quite sure why I call this Montauk seafood salad except Montag is known for its seafood and a lot of the seafood here comes from Montauk that's where the fishing boats are this is salad we've been making for a long time at Barefoot Contessa it's got shrimp and mussels and scallops in it and it's just fresh and delicious so the first thing I'm doing is peeling and deveining the shrimp so I take off the tail I leave the tail on only if we're going to pick up the shrimp individually with your fingers but for salad you want you can see there's this little vein that goes right down the back of the shrimp that's really its intestinal tract how's that for pretty but you really don't want to eat it so just make sure you take it out perfect the key to cooking shrimp is to undercook it everybody over cooks it it cooks in one and a half to two minutes tops last one okay that's one and a half pounds of shrimp I've got boiling water I want to put about 1/2 a cup of white wine vinegar in it this just flavors the shrimp while it's cooking so the tablespoon of salt bring you to a boil just put the shrimp in and time it really carefully one and a half minutes two tops depending on how big the shrimp are these are pretty big shrimp I just stand here and stare at it because I know the minute I walk away I'll forget about it you can just try one and just feel if it's really firm and it's not translucent it's white it's done so that wasn't even a minute and a half right into Bowl just drain it [Music] so that's the shrimp done now I'm going to make the scallops and the mussels and a delicious lemon vinaigrette so the next part of my Montauk seafood salad is the scallops these are actually sea scallops and they're particularly big ones if you have sea scallops they're really too big to sort of bite into an ax salad so I'm going to cut them in half before I cook them and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just poach them in the same water that I pushed the shrimp so it's got a little bit of wine vinegar in it and salt okay now just come back to a boil I'm just going to add the scallops and depending on the size they'll cook in a minute if there's bay scallops and maybe four to five minutes of their sea scallops I'm just until they're just cooked and firm while that's cooking then we prepare the mussels what I want to do when the mussels is first make sure it's alive and if it's closed it's alive sometimes if they stay open and you touch them and they don't close you want to toss it out because it's not alive the next thing I want to do is take this little what's called the beard off just a little thing just grab it if you can take it up it's a little tug-of-war I do with the mussel just comes off like that so what I've done with these mussels as I've scrubbed them and they suck them in water with a little bit of flour and what happens is the mussels drink in the water and flour and disgorge any sand that's in them okay so I think the scallops are done and you can tell they're firm perfect drain them [Music] whoa hi vinegar looks quite an infusion okay right into the bowl with the shrimp okay that's the scallops and after the mussels just dump the mussels in the pan got a half a cup of boiling water here we hear them talking to me okay lid on I'm just going to shake them a little make sure that the bottom ones in the top ones cook evenly about three to five minutes and they're all going to be open I'm gonna be great I think I smell that crumble [Music] that's gorgeous fun raspberry crumble with almonds and oatmeal on the top who's not going to let that visit so I think the muscles are done yeah good great I'm just gonna drain them and then I'm gonna take them out of the shell and it smell great smells like the sea well wow they look great you just want to take the mussels right out of their little shells then I'm gonna make a nice lemon vinaigrette for them this week you tell it might be nice with some local wine I hope they bring some back so this is our 2004 Pinot Grigio really beautiful characterful Pinot Grigio great with fresh goat cheeses and sheep's milk cheeses I'm just gonna smell it because someone has to be the designated driver you all taste it smells great I'm waiting for the red the red wine fan yeah absolutely - thank you so much for someone buying the Barefoot Contessa and our gradient Cheers I'm gonna make a lemon vinaigrette for the Montauk seafood salad it's a little unusual because I'm going to heat the oil I'm going to infuse lots of flavor into it one cup of oil I'm just going to heat it up I'm gonna use the zest of two lemons and then I'm going to use the juice tomato vinaigrette I can see the oil is just getting hot so it's just time to put all these flavors in okay so teaspoon of chopped garlic right into the oil you want it warm not sizzling hot about a half a teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves and the zest of two lemons right into the oil I'm just going to turn off the heat and let all those flavors infuse into the oil while I get the rest of the ingredients for the vinaigrette I better hurry I think Jax might be back soon now for the rest of the lemon vinaigrette I need a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice perfect just pour it right into the flavored oil next thing is one teaspoon of good Dijon mustard it's really like magnet vinaigrette you just starting with heated oil two tablespoons of good white wine or champagne vinegar two teaspoons of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper just need to whisk this all together we'll pour it all over the sutures pour underneath them its flavor so save some for later you might want to add some later big thrown toss it all together and now I'm going to add celery on some fresh parsley two stalks of celery right into the salad and then just some fresh parsley okay that looks great shrimp and scallops and mussels fresh lemon juice crunch of celery that's gonna be good and actually just so they'll know that it's a lemon vinaigrette you wanna take some lemon and put it right in so just slice the lemon in half I'm just a little very thin half rounds of fresh lemon to a platter for for [Music] that's enough for for real taste of the Hamptons just in time perfect guys okay Jeff eyeballs great huh where'd you go what'd you do would you see the beach we went to the vineyard directly there oh that's for me thank you wow three different kinds and I made dinner for you I mean Montauk seafood salad then plum

summer peach raspberry some of the other plums are really good so they're perfect okay now I'm gonna make an oatmeal crumble topping with almonds it's delicious so start with a cup of flour 30 cup sugar white sugar and I use 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar to think gives a nicer rich flavor its lightly packed quarter of a teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor I need a quarter to stick of butter and I've actually already cut it up so it stayed nice and cold just put it right into the food processor and then I'm just going to process it until the butter is like the size of peas okay the brothers done I'm just going to put this in the bowl with half a cup of oatmeal you want to use good old-fashioned oats not quick cooking or instant and have a cup of almonds I like the blanched sliced almonds it's a really good flavor with some plums I'm just going to take my hand stir and 1/4 of a cup of flour that's what makes the goo so delicious about two tablespoons of fresh orange juice and the last thing is a half-pint of fresh raspberries I'm just gonna toss that all together just toss it carefully you don't want to bruise the raspberries too much and a lot depends on how much juice there isn't the fruit if it's very very juicy fruit and I want to add a little bit more flour okay the dish it's great in the winter I make apple and pear crumbles in the summer peach raspberry this time of the year the plums are really good so they're perfect okay now I'm gonna make an oatmeal crumble topping with almonds it's delicious so start with a cup of flour [Music] 13 cup of sugar white sugar and I use 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar - I think it gives a nice sort of rich flavor lightly packed quarter of a teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavour and they don't close you want to toss it out because it's not alive the next thing I want to do is take this little what's called the beard off just a little thing just grab it if you can take it off it's a little tug of war I do with the muscle what just comes off like that so what I've done with these muscles is I've scrubbed them and I soaked them in water with a little bit of flour and what happens is the muscles drink in the water and flour and disgorge any sand that's in them okay so I think the scallops are done and you can tell they're firm perfect drain them [Music] whoa hi vinegar looks quite an infusion okay right into the bowl with the shrimp yeah okay that's the scallops and after the mussels just dump the mussels in the pan got a half a cup of boiling water Kerry he haven't talking to me okay lid on I'm just gonna shake them a little make sure that the bottom ones in the top ones cook evenly about three to five minutes and they're all going to be open and they'll be great I think I smell that crumble and then all the butter and mustard on the outside this is time to use your hands if you don't mind having messy hands just rub the outside make sure the fillet of these stays really moist when you roast it put it roasted a very high temperature so I want to make sure it's really sort of crusty on the outside and moist on the inside and this ensures that that happens I always like to use the seasonings in the coating that I'm using in the sauce so is mustard and the horseradish sauce and it's nice on the fillet beef to have the tablespoon of kosher salt just do it really evenly it seems like a lot of salt but remember it's the only flavoring it's really important have a tablespoon of cracked pepper really evenly over okay I'm going to roast it at 500 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes so into the oven it's going to be just brown and crusty on the outside and succulent and juicy inside and then I'm going to make sandwiches with horseradish and mustard sauce so the first thing I need is 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise I just want this to be really flavorful sauce for because cup of mayonnaise 1 an ant a pepper really evenly over it okay I'm going to roast it at 500 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes so into the oven it's going to be just brown and crusty on the outside and succulent and juicy inside and then I'm going to make sandwiches with horseradish and mustard sauce so the first thing I need is 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise I just want this to be really flavorful sales for it because cup of mayonnaise one of them tablespoons of Dijon mustard [Music] because I'd like something to look like what it tastes like half a tablespoon of coarse grain mustard and then for a little heat have a tablespoon of horseradish prepared horseradish that should do it two tablespoons of sour cream and just a pinch of salt and just mix it together so that's a really easy sauce for fillet beef and I smell it I think it's done carefully one and a half minutes two tops depending on how big the shrimp are these are pretty big shrimp I just stand here and stare on it because I know the minute I walk away I'll forget about it you can just try one and just feel if it's really firm and it's not translucent it's white it's done so that wasn't even a minute and a half right into Bowl just drain it so that's the shrimp done now I'm going to make the scallops and the mussels and a delicious lemon vinaigrette so the next part of my Montauk seafood salad is the scallops these are actually sea scallops and they're particularly big ones if you have sea scallops they're really too big to sort of bite into an ax salad so I'm going to cut them in half before I cook them and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just poach them in the same water that I pushed the shrimp so it's got a little bit of wine vinegar in it and salt okay now just come back to a boil I'm just going to add the scallops and depending on the size they'll cook in a minute if there's bay scallops and maybe four to five minutes of their sea scallops I'm just until they're just cooked and firm while that's cooking Emily prepare them that's in them okay so I think the scallops are done and you can tell they're firm perfect drain them whoa I've vinegar that's quite an infusion okay right into the bowl with the shrimp okay that's the scallops and after the mussels the stump the mussels in the pan got a half a cup of boiling water Terry hear them talking to me okay lid on I'm just going to shake them a little make sure that the bottom ones in the top ones cook easily about three to five minutes and they're all going to be open I'm gonna be great I think I smell that crumble that's gorgeous fun raspberry crumble with almonds and oatmeal on the top who's not going to let that is it so I think the mussels are done yeah good great I'm just gonna drain them and then I'm gonna take them out of the shell they smell great smells like the sea well wow they look great you just want to take the mussels right out of their little shells and then I'm gonna make a nice lemon vinaigrette for them this seafood style it might be nice with some local wine I hope they bring some back so this is our 2004 Pinot Grigio really beautiful character for Pinot Grigio great with fresh goat cheeses and sheep's milk cheeses I'm just gonna smell it because someone has to be the designated driver you all taste but it smells great I'm waiting for the red the red wine family yeah absolutely so thank you so much for someone by the Barefoot Contessa and our great example yours I'm gonna make a lemon vinaigrette for the Montauk seafood salad it's a little unusual because I'm gonna heat the oil to infuse lots of flavor into it 1 cup of oil I'm just going to heat it up when we use the zest of two lemons and then I'm going to use the juice to make a vinaigrette I can see the oils just getting hot so it's just time to put all these flavors in okay so teaspoon of chopped garlic right into the oil you want it warm not sizzling hot about a half a teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves and the zest of two lemons right into the oil I'm just going to turn off the heat and let all those flavors infuse into the oil while I get the rest of the ingredients for the vinaigrette I better hurry I think Jax may be back soon now for the rest of the lemon vinaigrette I need a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice perfect just pour it right into the flavored oil next thing is one teaspoon of good Dijon mustard it's really like Megan's vinaigrette you're just starting with heated oil two tablespoons of good white wine or champagne vinegar two teaspoons of salt and half a teaspoon of pepper just need to whisk this all together [Music] repor it all over the speakers pour underneath so it flavors it save some for later you might want to add some later big thrown toss it all together and now I'm gonna add celery I'm some fresh parsley two stalks of celery right into the salad and then just some fresh parsley okay that looks great shrimp and scallops and mussels fresh lemon juice crunch of celery that's gonna be good and actually just so they'll know there's a lemon vinaigrette take some lemon and put it right in so just slice the lemon in half I'm just a little very thin half [Music] my friend jack is a fabulous realtor but kind of an inexperienced cook he has some dear friends that he's going to take on a food tour at the Hamptons so we made a plan together I owe him a huge favor so I've offered to make them sandwiches for the beach and a light supper for after the tour I think I'm gonna use a lot of local ingredients from my cooking for lunch I'm making them filet of beef sandwiches with a mustard horseradish sauce that has a real kick for dinner a seafood salad made from shellfish from Montauk and a zesty lemon vinaigrette and for dessert a plum raspberry crumble with local fruit and a crisp oatmeal and almond topping after their tour of the Hamptons and some delicious meals I hope they'll love this place as much as I do so the first thing I'm going to do for Jack and his friends is make filet beef sandwich with horseradish sauce so I have a half a fillet of beef and sleep great seasoning on the outside the first thing I want to do is make a a butter you need to use room-temperature butter and mix it with about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard so I'm just going to mash this together a little bit the whole thing about beef is just make sure you get lots of flavor in it thinking about making sandwiches is you can make it with anything that you use as a main course loin of pork with chutney filet beef with horseradish sauce so I'm going to take that have a filet of beef and Pat it dry with paper towels which ensures that the butter is going to stick to it and then all the butter and mustard on the outside this is time to use your hands if you don't mind having messy hands just rub the outside make sure the filet abuse stays really moist when you roast it could have roasted a very high temperature so I want to make sure it's really sort of crusty on the outside and moist on the inside and this ensures that that happens I always like to use the seasonings in the coating that I'm using in the sauce oh there's mustard in the horseradish sauce and it's nice on the filet beef to have two tablespoon of kosher salt just do it really evenly it seems like a lot of salt but remember it's the only flavoring it's really important 1/2 a tablespoon of cracked pepper really evenly over it okay I'm going to roast it at 500 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes so into the oven it's going to be just brown and crusty on the outside and succulent and juicy inside and then I'm going to make sandwiches with horseradish and mustard sauce so the first thing I need is 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise I just want this to be really flavorful sales for because a cup of mayonnaise one and a half tablespoons of Dijon mustard because I like something to look like what it tastes like half a tablespoon of coarse grain mustard and then for a little heat have a tablespoon of horseradish prepared horseradish that should do it two tablespoons of sour cream and just a pinch of salt I'll just mix it together so that's a really easy sauce for filet beef and I smell it I think it's done Wow that's perfectly cooked alright let's just test it with a meat thermometer you want to be 120 degrees with an instant meat thermometer it's really easy to do I nailed it okay now I'm going to cover it with aluminum foil so I'm just going to let it rest for about 15 minutes and all the juices get back into the meat that's gonna make a delicious sandwich so Jack and his friends are on their trip I hope they made it can be Cox dairy and what kind of cheese is it sorry this one is called Nick Hawks sunrise okay the brothers done I'm just going to put this in a bowl with half a cup of oatmeal you want to use good old-fashioned oats not quick cooking or instant and have a cup of almonds I like the blanched sliced almonds it's a really good flavor with drip plums I'm just going to take my hands and just rub this together until it makes big crumbles sometimes these are called crisps but I'm calling it crumble okay right on the top spread it out evenly so the fruit is all covered it's going to bake 350 degrees for about 40 minutes and so the food is all bubbly and delicious and tender into the up okay that's it for dessert I hope the guys are enjoying that lunch at the beach listen for we wrote speeches waterfall how's the sandwich it's obvious really delicious mmm and we're only halfway through the tour it's a good thing we have some nourishment what else you have planned jack it's a big secret but it'll be fun I'm not quite sure why I call this Montauk seafood cell except Montauk is known for its seafood and a lot of the seafood here comes from Montauk that's where the fishing boats are this is salad we've been making for a long time at Barefoot Contessa it's got shrimp and mussels and scallops in it it's just fresh and delicious so the first thing I'm doing is peeling and deveining the shrimp so I take off the tail I leave the tail on only if we're going to pick up the shrimp individually with your fingers but for salad you want you can see there's this little vein that goes right down the back of the shrimp that's really it's intestinal tract how's that for pretty but you really don't want to eat it so just make sure you take it out perfect the key to cooking shrimp is to undercook it everybody over cooks it it cooks in one and a half to two minutes tops last one okay that's one and a half pounds of shrimp I've got boiling water I want to put about 1/2 a cup of white wine vinegar in it this just flavors the shrimp while it's cooking a tablespoon of salt bring it to a boil just put the shrimp in and time it really carefully one and a half minutes two tops depending on how big the shrimp are these are pretty big shrimp I just stand here and stare on it because I know the minute I walk away I'll forget about it you can just try one and just feel if it's really firm and it's not translucent it's white it's done so that wasn't even a minute and a half right into Bowl just drain it [Music] so that's the shrimp done now I'm going to make the scallops and the mussels and a delicious one I'm vinaigrette so the next part of my Montauk seafood salad is the scallops these are actually sea scallops and they're particularly big ones if you have sea scallops they're really too big to sort of bite into an ax salad so I'm going to cut them in half before I cook them and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just poach them in the same water that I poached the shrimp so it's got a little bit of wine vinegar in it and salt okay now just come back to a boil I'm just going to add the scallops and depending on the size they'll cook in a minute if there's bay scallops and maybe four to five minutes of their sea scallops just until they're just cooked and firm while that's cooking I'm going to prepare the mussels what I want to do when the mussels is first make sure it's alive and if it's closed it's alive sometimes if they stay open and you touch them and they don't close you want to toss it out because it's not alive the next thing I want to do is take this little what's called the beard off just a little thing just grab it if you can take it off it's a little tug-of-war I do with the mussel just comes off like that so what I've done with these mussels is I've scrubbed them and I set them in water with a little bit of flour and what happens is the mussels drink in the water and flour and disc or to any sand rounds of fresh lemon just to a platter for for [Music] that's enough for for real taste of the Hamptons I'm just in time perfect guys okay Jeff I know great huh where'd you go what'd you do we just see on the beach we went to the vineyard really directly there oh that's for me thank you well three different kinds and I made dinner for you I mean Montauk seafood salad and then I clumb raspberry crumble thank you for my wife can't wait to see you die well they may eat their dinner but I'm gonna be drinking mine it's great in the winter I make apple and pear crumbles in the summer peach raspberry this time of the year the plums are really good so they're perfect okay now I'm gonna make an oatmeal crumble topping with almonds it's delicious so start with a cup of flour [Music] 30 cup of sugar white sugar and I use 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar 2 things gives a nice sort of rich flavor lightly packed quarter teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor need a quarter stick of butter and I've actually already cut it up so it's stay nice and cold just put it right into the food processor and then I'm just going to process it until the butter is like the size of peas okay the butters done just going to put this in a bowl with half a cup of oatmeal you want to use good old-fashioned oats not quick cooking or instant and half a cup of almonds I like the blanched sliced almonds it's a really good flavor with the plums I'm just going to take my hand stir and 1/4 of a cup of flour that's what makes the goo so delicious that 2 tablespoons of fresh orange juice and the last thing is a half pint of fresh raspberries I'm just gonna toss that all together just toss it carefully you don't want to bruise the raspberries too much and a lot depends on how much juice there isn't the fruit if it's very very juicy fruit and I want to add a little bit more flour ok the dish it's great in the winter I make apple and pear crumbles in the summer peach raspberry this time of the year the plums are really good so they're perfect okay now I'm gonna make an oatmeal crumble topping with almonds it's delicious so start with a cup of flour there's a cup of sugar white sugar and I use 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar to think gives a nice sort of rich flavor lightly packed quarter teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor and they don't close you want to toss it out because it's not alive the next thing I want to do is take this little it's called the beard off just a little thing just grab it if you can take it up it's a little tug of war I do with the muscle just comes off like that so what I've done with these muscles as I've scrubbed them and I soaked them in water with a little bit of flour and what happens is the muscles drink in the water and flour and disgorge any sand that's in them okay so I think the scallops are done and you can tell they're firm perfect during them whoa I've vinegar that's quite an infusion okay right into the bowl with the shrimp yeah okay that's the scallops and therefore the mussels yes so I named it because

sandwiches fillet Zee horseradish sauce love this bread cuz it's just filled with all kinds of grains and you can see oatmeal in it and wonderful that's so much flavor I always put a little bit of room temperature butter on the bottom it really creates a little bit of a barrier so it keeps the bread moist okay the next thing is mustard horseradish sauce don't neglect the corners I'm gonna make sure every bite has muscle roars radish sauce in it okay now I've got a Rugel I just think it's a really nice peppery flavor with was beef so it's gonna be mmmm that's great good a true Beulah so I'm gonna put a little bit of a bed of arugula on it don't ice to have something crunchy in a sandwich it can be basil leaves it can be really tender lettuce okay and now the filet beef perfectly done because it's been resting well the resting really makes a huge difference it just cooks all the way through without getting overcooked on the outside okay and then just a tiny bit of butter on the last slice for the same reason just keep the moisture in that's a really nice hearty sandwich they're gonna love it [Music] boy you got the perfect day how are you [Applause] hi Lois so you're going

I'm gonna do a whole dinner with Long Island ingredients for you boy okay oh yeah you're good yeah I know that's the dirty secret have a wonderful time come with you hurry back oh nice cheese I found some gorgeous plums at the farm since I thought it'd be nice to make a plum raspberry crumble so I have two pounds of plums I've just pitted them and I'm going to slice them into 1 inch wedges I actually love making crumbles I really prefer to cake I just I love good cooked fruit desserts I'm gonna big bowl there cup of sugar and 1/4 of a cup of flour that's what makes the goo so delicious about two tablespoons of fresh orange juice and the last thing is a half-pint of fresh raspberries I'm just gonna toss that all together just toss it carefully you don't want to bruise the raspberries too much and a lot depends on how much juice there isn't the fruit if it's very very juicy fruit and I want to add a little bit more flour okay the dish it's great in the winter I make apple and pear crumbles in the summer peach raspberry this time of the year the plums are really good so they're perfect okay now I'm gonna make an oatmeal crumble topping with almonds it's delicious so start with a cup of flour [Music] 30 cup sugar white sugar and I use 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar 2 things gives a nice sort of rich flavor lightly packed quarter of a teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor I need a quarter of a stick of butter and I've actually already cut it up so it stay nice and cold just put it right into the food processor and then I'm just going to process it until the butter is like the size of peas you
you something that around here is usually Chinese takeout I'm gonna surprise my husband Jeffrey with a romantic dinner and I'm making his favorite meal breakfast just because I'm making breakfast for dinner with french toast and hash browns doesn't mean I have to have coffee and orange juice I would say nice little champagne cocktail be much more romantic everybody knows what a kir Royale is it's champagne with cassis I just thought it'd be really fun today to make a raspberry Royale which is champagne with a little friend Waze and maybe a raspberry so I'm gonna get the ingredients so this is vanilla sugar it's a vanilla bean that I've immersed in this jar of sugar and I just leave it there for years what I'm gonna do is dip the glasses and I let them dry and then later I'll put the champagne in the glasses so a little bit of friend Waze in one dish friend Waze is a raspberry liqueur and then the other dish a little bit of life and no live sugar this is great for baking or for flavoring tea or anything it's so good I'm gonna take that rim of the glass and just dip it right in the rim bloss and then directly into the vanilla sugar and you'll see it makes this gorgeous sort of a raspberry colored rim I'm gonna let that dry and then I'm gonna fill it with fresh raspberries a little bit of friend vos and champagne how fabulous is that so romantic I love it this is a challah it's um it's an egg bread that's been braided it's sort of a traditional Jewish bread but you can use any kind of egg bread or brioche bread that comes with a loaf I'm just gonna leave this to dry out a little bit so when I mix it with a custard will just absorb all that flavor so the custard six eggs and I always try and crack the eggs on the board rather than on the side of the dish so you don't get shells in them I like to use extra-large eggs but you can really use large eggs anything that you have around extra-large eggs I find our better value there's more egg pradhana or how's that for an esoteric fact okay and the next thing is milk or half and half if you really want to be over-the-top it's a cup and a half of whole milk or half and ham I'm gonna keep my husband around for a long time so I'll use milk I'm just gonna whisk it in when I was thinking about this recipe I wanted to make traditional french toast but I really wanted to pump up the flavor so challah does that which is great but also I wanted the custard to have more flavor so what I'm gonna do is I'll show you I'm gonna add orange which is a really traditional breakfast kind of thing my handy-dandy microplane which I love someone add a little bit of orange maybe about a teaspoon really make this to your own taste if you like more orange or less orange play with it until you get it exactly right and the next thing is vanilla so but 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and honey honey I'll sweeten it but I think it sweetens it with more flavor than sugar white sugar really doesn't do anything for me and mmm doesn't that look good and the last thing is a pinch of salt it's amazing how much salt makes a difference in a recipe like this so now the custard has lots of flavor when I'm going to soak the bread it'll just absorb all that good flavor I'm I got isolated oh oh look at these these roses are incredible they smell incredible Oh fabulous so I need something not orange roses not hard how many years has it been I've been buying our dresses for way too long what's what's really nice I'm doing a romantic dinner for Jennifer dinner what would be fabulous well kukku high sense of you okay yeah that roses are beautiful card rose garden roses I don't know orange tulips I'll take have it all of this I want to Lipsett of Oz but also petals on the table that'll be pl okay before hi Reuben I'm good yeah oh these are gonna be beautiful think you ever think of manta oh they're fantastic thanks so much thank you mmm ah I'll season see you soon and that for one of my all-time favorite recipes shortbread hearts and what's more appropriate for a romantic dinner so first thing is butter lots of it and you want the butter to be absolutely room-temperature you can leave it at butter really doesn't spoil so you can leave it out overnight you can leave it out for a few hours but just make sure it's room temperature all the way through got three sticks of butter I love this recipe it's so easy to make and the incredible thing about it is you can make so many different things out of it you'll put this on very low speed and then I need a cup of sugar so I'm just gonna mix the sugar and butter until it's just combined I don't want to whip it because I don't want a lot of air in it so the butter and sugar is combined and now I'm just gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla okay time for the flour so I need three and a half cups of flour this is all-purpose flour and what I do is I just lighten it when I'm scooping it just lighten it a little bit and then scoop it without packing it down and level it off you can level it off with a knife I just use my finger and put it into a sieve over a bowl that's three and a half cups of flour and I'm gonna add a big pinch of salt and then just sift it all together I just want to make sure it's all smooth and all we have to do is put that in at low speed into the mixer just do it slowly so it gets combined it's a really critical stage in baking flour has gluten in it which is what you use to develop bread dough and you don't want to develop the gluten because you don't want it to get tough so it's all crumbly now I'm gonna dump it onto the board this should make about twenty four big shortbread parts I like to refrigerate it for about 15 minutes until it just firms up a little bit it's much easier to cut wrap it up is it the fruit so the shortbread should be perfectly chilling about 15 minutes what good is it if you're not wearing all the flour right got a rolling pin and my heart cookie cutter it's a little crooked but mean that just means it's been used a lot so don't worry about having too much flour on the shortbread because it really helps I want it when I'm rolling it out I want to be sure it's always moving and you roll it from the center out and then you make sure they end up with something that's evenly rolled out you can see it moves really nicely just keep moving the whole thing around so you're sure when you cut it out you're not going to end up with cookies stuck on the board I always do a little parchment paper on the cookie sheet so I know they're not gonna stick I just take them out obviously you can do this any shape but for tonight it's gonna be hard shape I'm just gonna sprinkle sugar on the cookies and I'm gonna bake now into the oven 350 for about 20 minutes or until they're just starting to brown on the top and they'll be wonderful strawberries so I've got some turkey sausages that I cooked they cook in about 20 minutes turkey sausages are so great I get them from the butcher and they're really much lighter than pork sausages and I think I'll keep them warm in the oven okay now on to the hashbrowns I was actually testing recipes when Jeffrey was working in the study one day and I kept bringing in all kinds of variations on hash browns and he said this was his favorite I'm just gonna put five tablespoons of butter in the pan and about one and a half cups of onions it's so maybe about two big onions these are really traditional hash browns but they have so much more flavor let that butter melt a little I've got about a pound and a half of potatoes that I've cut up in advance here and I soaked them just to make sure that they didn't turn brown drain them out so for this recipe I like to use boiling potatoes which are those sort of waxy rounder potatoes now this is the key it's really important to salt and pepper this dish while you're cooking with it so that the flavor really gets into the potatoes and the onions so I've got about it two teaspoons of salt I use kosher salt and one teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper I'm gonna let this sit for a few minutes until it gets really Brown and crusty on the bottom and then I'm gonna toss it so all the potatoes get perfectly browned all over uh it's gonna be so good he's gonna love it these are perfect egg brown and crusty so I'm gonna leave them over here to cook a little more and then just before serving we're gonna try some scallions and parsley it's gonna release all that wonderful herb flavor to be fabulous great so my challah french toast I'm gonna soak the challah in the custard just a couple of minutes on both sides just sort of hold it down so it gets nicely soaked if you can soak it for five minutes it's great if you don't have the time and you're too hungry it's okay but the longer you soak it and actually the drier the bread is the better I actually so one recipe where you had to let it sit for half an hour now just imagine that everybody's sitting waiting for breakfast and you have to stand there for half an hour and let it soak forget it so while that's okay I mean we get the butter so let me have a better tablespoon of butter when I'm sauteing things I want to mix butter and oil because I'll get the flavor of the butter with the high burning temperature of the oil so but a tablespoon of oil should do it that's perfect get it nice and hot shit so it's good and hot but not burning all right and they go I'm gonna cook these for about three minutes on each side until they're nice and browned and while that's happening I'm gonna soak the next slices of bread which is about the same amount of time three minutes it works out perfectly just like that this is gonna be so good with hashbrowns turkey sausage and then a treat for this earth I think my husband's gonna be thrilled so I'm gonna serve the French toast with a drizzle of really good maple syrup and maybe a dusting of confectioner's sugar it would be good so these look like they're perfectly done and put them on a sheet pan put them in the oven and now for the next one's in another tablespoon of butter maybe a little less this time I hate when everything has to come at exactly the same time and you're juggling all these pans but everything's gonna stay warm in the oven until it's all done and then dinner can be served at once I'm just gonna go get change for breakfast so Jeffrey thinks it's a day just like any other day boys he wrong I'm pulling out all the romantic stops so I'm gonna do chocolate dipped strawberries which I think are so lovely first the chocolate what I'm going to do is make ganache ganache is a combination of melted chocolate and heavy cream half a cup of chocolate chips three tablespoons of heavy cream the key is that this the chocolate melt but it not get too hot because otherwise it'll start to separate so I'm just gonna whisk this together and then I'm just gonna leave it to melt while I get the strawberries right these are the most gorgeous long stem strawberries and they're just they smell they have a strawberry essence that's just wonderful I'm just gonna snip that off a little bit on the diagonal it looks really pretty so I'm gonna set them out so they're ready so let's see how the chocolates doing oh it's nicely melted I want to make sure it's totally not that they're no little piece of chocolate in it I want to make sure that's a really low flame so it's not keep it on but very low so the chocolate doesn't burn there's nothing where's the taste of burnt chocolate they're not very romantic it's smooth it's glossy it's the perfect see the nice really nice consistency perfect for the strawberries now comes the good part I love to leave half of the strawberry showing so I'm just going to dip the bottom half in it how gorgeous is that mmm so sensual isn't it now you can really do this in dark chocolate bittersweet chocolate semi-sweet chocolate but also it's fun to do sometimes in white chocolate do the same thing and melt the white chocolate a little bit of heavy cream so you make a white chocolate ganache or sometimes if you want to be really over-the-top you can do dark chocolate and then drizzle the top with white chocolate melted white chocolate mmm how much this is a hmm it's so good it's strawberry sort of tart it's sweet but art and the chocolates like the perfect balance for that he's gonna love these all right I'm gonna put this all together now it's gonna be so gorgeous on the table in front of the fireplace I'm right smack in the middle remember these are the vanilla shortbread hearts with a dusting of sugar on the top so they sparkle now who wouldn't fall in love with you if you serve them this so I've got all these gorgeous potatoes ready though that have grounds and they just cooked in butter with onions and salt and pepper it's just so simple but I think it needs a little something to sort of just turn up the volume so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to add I've chopped parsley and scallions and I think that'll just do the trick it's gonna really give it that little hiccup I'm gonna turn off the heat toss them together maybe finish it with a just a touch of extra salt oh these look so good I've to taste to make sure they're all right I'm gonna I'm gonna serve it with his wonderful slices of kala french toast and turkey sausage I'm so good potatoes are crisp but they're tender and the scallions when the heat hits the scallions it really brings out the flavor so all that's left to do is pour out the champagne Geoffrey thinks to did just like any other day I'm sure he expects dinner in the kitchen but I'm setting it up in the living room in front of the roaring fire so clean up a little and never have too many flowers so I've got parrot tulips I think in a small intimate dinner it's really nice to have a small arrangement of flowers and these are orange parrot tulips one of the keys to keeping tulips straight is a little pin and it just stick it in the end of each tulip and then it drinks the water better I want them to straight cuz I like when tulips aren't avars the way they grow sort of a little wild and messy I think this if you're really sexy sitting may be the last I'm gonna scatter the petals on the table it's so beautiful I'd say he's gonna be surprised so the last thing is the raspberry Royale our champagne cocktail I've got my champagne glasses that were dipped in friend woz and vanilla sugar and this is so cool actually it's gotten very hard which is wonderful and it's pink which I love these are huge raspberries which are great maybe two raspberries in each one and a little bit of friend woz raspberry liqueur maybe about two tablespoons in each one else gonna be so good and of course champagne I wonder if I'll hear the pop hmm oh this is gonna be so good this is so simple and so luxurious that looks great hello fabulous what's in years it's friend woz and fresh raspberries well it was a great good champagne always makes a different milk yeah just when you were expected Chinese takeout right you got that's right this is not the usual raspberry Roy Chinese teeth this is habit-forming this is their habit of Harmony oh now you're gonna want it every Sunday night okay my gorgeous fellow french toast and the turkey sausages there's gorgeous hashbrowns I can smell it perhaps a bit of powdered sugar on the french toast how gorgeous is that I'm a drizzle a really good maple syrup like it doesn't feel like breakfast does oh no it feels like something really an okay it's like oh no a foreign country having something that you never thought of having before and then saying you got to make this all okay I will and deserve that's really good I'm so glad you like another but yeah listen until you get it exactly right and the next thing is vanilla so but half teaspoon of vanilla and honey honey I'll sweeten it but I think it sweetens it with more flavor than sugar white sugar really doesn't do anything for me and it doesn't that look good and the last thing is a pinch of salt it's amazing how much salt makes a difference in a recipe like this so now the custard has lots of flavor when I'm gonna soak the bread it'll just absorb all that good flavor hi my god I sweetie something that around here is usually Chinese takeout I'm going to surprise my husband Jeffrey with a romantic dinner and I'm making his favorite meal breakfast just because I'm making breakfast for dinner with french toast and hash browns doesn't mean I have to have coffee and orange juice I was saying that's little champagne cocktail be much more romantic everybody knows what a cure ray and the next thing is milk or half and half if you really want to be over the top it's a cup and a half of whole milk or half and half when I keep my husband around for a long time so I'll use milk I'm just gonna whisk it in when I was thinking about this recipe I wanted to make traditional French toast but I won't really wanted to pump up the flavor so challah does that which is great but also I wanted the custard to have more flavor so what I'm gonna do is I'll show you I'm gonna add orange which is a really traditional breakfast kind of thing my handy-dandy microplane which i love someone add a little bit of orange maybe about a teaspoon but really make this to your own taste if you like more orange or less orange I will a trim I'm gonna let that dry and then I'm gonna fill it with fresh raspberries a little bit of friend wasps and champagne how fabulous is that so romantic I love it this is a challah it's um it's an egg bread that's been braided it's sort of a traditional Jewish bread but you can use any kind of egg bread or brioche bread that comes in a loaf I'm just gonna leave this to dry out a little bit so when I mix it with a custard will just absorb all that flavor so the custard six eggs and I always try and crack the eggs on the board rather than on the side of the dish so you don't get shells in them I like to use extra-large eggs but you can really use large eggs anything that you have around extra-large eggs I find our better value there's more egg predominant Eric fact okay all is its champagne with cassis I just thought it'd be really fun today to make a raspberry Royale which is champagne with a little friend Baz and maybe a raspberry so I'm gonna get the ingredients so this is vanilla sugar it's a vanilla bean that I've immersed in this jar of sugar and I just leave it there for years what I'm gonna do is dip the glasses and let them dry and then later I'll put the champagne in the glasses so a little bit of creme waz in one dish friend Boz is a raspberry liqueur and then the other dish a little bit of my vanilla sugar this is great for baking or for flavoring tea or anything so good I'm gonna take that rim of the glass and just dip it right in the ground bloss and then directly into the vanilla sugar and you'll see it makes this gorgeous sort of a raspberry
[Music] edweena van gaal was the most wonderful garden designer not only did she design my garden but I feel really lucky to count her as one of my dear friends so today edweena's bringing me a big box with all kinds of fresh herbs in it and I thought I would return the favor by making her a box with a wonderful dinner on the menu furred weena is a lobster cobb salad bursting with flavors packed into a roll with the delicious brown rice tomato and basil salad that's both hearty and healthy and for dessert an individual orange Chocolate Chunk cake that's been soaked and our sir and drizzled with chocolate ganache so I'd better start cooking because I've got a mini feast to prepare [Music] I'd love to take a recipe that I know really well like a pound cake and do lots of variations and so what I'm gonna do for Edwina is I'm gonna make an orange Chocolate Chunk cake which is basically a pound cake with lots of orange flavor and chocolate chunks through it how good does that sound so the first thing I'm doing is dusting two oranges and the smell is amazing I just love the combination of chocolate and orange I think they really complement each other sort of like chocolate moves with her and Grand Marnier so what I've done is I've creamed quarter of a pound of butter and one cup of sugar until it's light and fluffy for about five minutes and then I'm gonna add some things to eggs one at a time until they're mixed in and they aren't just lots of arms okay now I'm gonna do the dry ingredients one and a half cups of flour and I stick them all together make sure they're really well combined and a half bacon it's really important to be exact okay then according to teaspoon of baking powder and make sure it's fresh so it rises properly go to the chick from the baking soda [Applause] according to police all let me sip this together it's not so good I can tell the orange zest and just mix it lightly with your hand so it's well mixed okay that's the dry mixture I'm going to make the wet mixture so the first thing I need is a quarter of a cup of fresh orange juice he's elected to sir if it's more than one on but it's a great tool if you only have a small amount to do okay that should do that right perfect okay now I need three ounces of buttermilk and actually always make sure you mix up the buttermilk because it sometimes settles down a little bit so it's relaxes it better month okay it's gonna look curdled don't be nervous about it and then one teaspoon of vanilla okay so that's the wet mixture so what I'm going to do is add the wet mix turn the dry mixture ultimately to the butter mixture and I'll end up with a really moist like cake this looks great it's really well whipped and everything's well incorporated so I'm going to add about a third of this mixture this is one you don't want to over beat it otherwise you'll end it with bread not cake let's do it slowly with your hand and then at the wet mixture a lot of people say they can't fake but it's really a matter of just being precise and then the dry so I'm going to put half of this in and leave a little at the end and then the wet mixture and then the dry mixture perfect and now for the reason why we're making this cake chocolate sauce we need one cup of chocolate chunks you can sometimes buy chocolate chunks in the grocery store but I'm just gonna use good chocolate and just chop it up what I'm doing is I'm gonna chop it up and then I'm going to add a little flour so they don't sink to the bottom of the cake just like that it really simple [Music] just a little dusting of flour to keep them from sinking to the bottom and now I'm just gonna fold them right in so usually I make this in a large bundt cake which is beautiful but I thought it'd be fun to make individual ones like the individual things kind of like cupcakes anybody get seven our own cake and they don't have to share at the end of the day well like children want our own so follow these chocolate chunks right in [Music] it was always such an inspiration for me and I was so touched when she said she wanted bring me an herb box so I thought well I'll just return the favor and send her back with good food so I'll show you what I've discovered recently it's amazing he's incredible little and they look I don't know what they are it's a silly sort of flexible silicone baking form looks like something with an acident but I'm sure they didn't they're wonderful for baking so these are gonna be simply little cakes and when you just flip them out they come out of the pan really easily there's no squeeze in [Music] and bake these 350 degrees for about 30 minutes and then I'm gonna soak it in a little bit of an orange syrup and put an orange glaze on it I think it is gonna be really pleased with them at least I hope so I'm painting up these two boxes one for me and one for ina and I'm doing this great blue for IANA because it reminds me of her and I call it Greek shuttered blue it's such a happy color [Music] so the chocolate orange chunk takes it cooled a little bit now sometimes I come out a little lopsided and I might straighten it out if it was a formal event but since it's a really earthy want I like the way they look now so there are three stages you can do them all in advance first the cakes next I'm gonna make an orange syrup that's gonna infuse them the flavor and then later I'm going to drizzle them with a little bit of chocolate ganache it sounds good doesn't it so first to make the syrup glaze I need a quarter of a cup of fresh orange juice okay I'm just gonna heat this up the quarter of a cup of sugar doesn't really have to cook I just want to heat it up so the sugar melts and it becomes very clear syrup so bring to a boil turn it off and it's done I'm just gonna spoon it over the cakes do it slowly and when the cakes are a little bit warm they absorb the syrup even better and then next I'm gonna make a chocolate ganache which is chocolate and cream that I'm gonna drizzle over the outside and I'm gonna make a brown rice tomato and basil salad for Audrina so next I'm gonna make chocolate ganache for the orange Chocolate Chunk cakes so I need have to kind of semi-sweet chocolate chips this bag is 12 ounces so it's got approximately what half a pound is writing can be people over simmering water and then I need 1/2 a cup of heavy cream don't worry about measuring too exactly if it's too thin you can add another few chocolate chips as if too thick you can just add some more cream and then one teaspoon of instant coffee powder or espresso whichever I just think coffee really brings out the chocolate flavor you're not aware of what it is it sort of cuts the sweetness and brings it out I'm just going to let that sit over simmering water for a few minutes just until it melts and it's smooth and then I'll drizzle it over the cake okay it's ready now you know it's a little bit thick we wanted to be running that sort of guapi so I'm gonna add another drop of heavy cream carefully I don't want to add too much do it just mix it in turn off the heat yes see that make the difference now it's running perfect I'm just going to drizzle it over the cakes it's gonna drizzle it over there just maybe like a tablespoon on the top and let it just drizzle down the side that looks good if you want to you can also just sort of drizzle it this way whichever you like I know what she likes and rosemary and a little something exotic some lemongrass so they don't look like much now but that's part of the fun of it that they're going to grow a lot so I decided to make brown rice of tomatoes and basil for agreement she's sort of a grown-up hippie and she does like a nice organic thing so I just thought it'd be perfectly appropriate for her so nervous something decadent for dessert and make something good for her how's the salad this is a really good salad and the best part is that the brown rice gives it a really nutty flavor and then I'm gonna add lots of tomatoes and fresh basil a nice vinaigrette so I'm just gonna cut up about a pound of tomatoes he's a good Israeli tomatoes on the vine so now I'm gonna make the vinaigrette I need a quarter of a cup of good champagne or white wine vinegar you know it's easy to make a vinaigrette right in the mixing Cup two teaspoons of sugar really makes the tomatoes sweeter tablespoon of good olive oil teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper remember you want the vinaigrette to be really flavorful so that I've cooked the brown rice took about 45 minutes so just pour the vinaigrette over and when it's warm it really absorbs the vinaigrette now that looks gorgeous I'm gonna toss it around I can smell on the vinaigrette hits the warm rice I can really smell it champagne vinegar all the flavors lots of tomatoes clean hams even the tomato juice is absorbed by the rice and then lots of fresh basil maybe about a cup of fresh basil leaves okay so can either julienne this or chop this I think I'll just chop it up it's great to make this in advance because all the flavors really get into the rice the vinaigrette lets absorb right into the middle of it and the basil gets into it and the tomato juice just tastes better and better and there's nothing that can spoil so considerably temperature okay lots of chopped basil right into the salad I'm gonna pack some pretty way that the Chinese takeout the dinner it's a really handy containers throw the Chinese takeout and ass up if I can have some they're always really nice and next I'm gonna make a lobster cops out for my favorite salads and the servant a role I think is gonna be really happy lobster Cobb salad I think I've made this more than anything else in all of my books it's really good it's really easy to make and you can assemble all the ingredients in advance there's all different kinds of vegetables avocados tomatoes and lobster and a delicious lemon vinaigrette blue cheese bacon it's really good and I think Ford we know what I'm going to do is put it into world so to be sandwich lobster Cobb salad sandwich the best avocados are Hass avocados from California it's not the bright green ones it's these ugly brown ones you can't smell it and you don't want to press it because you'll bruise it but you can tell when it's ripe when it's just this really brown color these are gorgeous big dose you've got a little fresh lemon juice with stuff the avocado from turning brown that's the trick with guacamole - fresh lemon juice always keeps the other color nice and green so toss it around just make sure all the cut surfaces are covered with lemon juice okay that's one ingredient next thing is Lobster I actually cheat and get it cooked in the seaters this is gorgeous cooked lobster I'm just going to dice it up so it's easy to eat what I have is one and a half pounds of cooked lobster meat it's about 2 1 and a half pound lobsters I'm cutting it up and I'd say the large bite-size pieces no one at all finely minced but you also want to be in let me eat it with a fork no nice ok that's it for the lobster next thing you can start Tomatoes one pint just kind of cut them in half if they're big you can use grape tomatoes which of those delicious tomato shaped like grapes or cherry tomatoes they can be read into the yellow I'm just gonna say anything lobster and tomato sauce or salt and pepper [Music] cop salad really is usually made with chicken this is a very luxurious palm of cobb salad but since the green has gone to all the trouble of making herb boxes for me I wanted to do something special from her [Music] this does it justice done and let's just make sure we've made the right choice the chartreuse or the blue definitely the blue that's perfect for ina okay now for fresh lemon vinaigrette for the lobster cobb salad gotta have fresh lemon so I need a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice [Applause] that's about one lemon [Applause] [Music] perfect I usually make the vinaigrette right in the measuring container you need 1/3 of a cup of olive oil I don't have tablespoon of Dijon mustard that's a better one okay where's the teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and just whisk it up actually love this little whisk that's amazing how often I use it just for a little vinaigrette measuring cup it's a really flavorful vinaigrette lots of mustard and lemon juice so I'm going to pour a lot of it over the lobster and tomatoes - save some for later because I've got more ingredients to put in just toss it all together then we're gonna add some more great ingredients gonna pack up the box for everyone [Music] okay so the next step in the lobster Cobb salad got lobster tomatoes nice lemon vinaigrette avocados that have been diced with lemon juice to keep them nice and bright green the next thing is bacon which I actually baked on a baking rack it's a really easy way to cook bacon just until it's nice and crisp and then I'm just going to cut it in chunks well you can just crumble it with your hands put right on top then you cheese you can use Stilton which I love but if you can't find still any kind of a crumbly bleu cheese it's really nice just adds a really great flavor to the lobster Cobb salad this is really composed salad and I love things like that now okay so blue cheese I'm gonna toss it all together make sure all these flavors are blended well the last thing I found is really good as a ruler it's a really peppery leaf and it really gives it a wonderful fresh kind of flavor it was tossed around with a vinaigrette so since lobster rolls are sort of at least Hampton thing and they're always served in like a hot dog bun I thought wouldn't it be fun to do lobster Cobb selling in a roll so that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna fill this you can obviously serve it just as a salad but I think it's fun to have a special treat where everything's individual like a kid at a birthday party having his own cupcake so that's one and the second one since its dinner I'm gonna make two I always say this is a mother unless out when your mother-in-law comes make it four she'll love it I love you okay I'm gonna wrap them up get them both in one piece of parchment paper perfect you even put into boxford we know it's got a bakery box from bakery store and I'm gonna line it with parchment paper so first the brown rice of tomatoes and basil and then the table salads sandwiches and the last thing is orange Chocolate Chunk cake final moment of decadence so that's a really special dinner for dueña in a box [Music] what are these babies this is the little bay tree yeah wow it's fantastic oh my god sage and lemongrass I never use lemongrass bye bye I love it it takes that's really big the blue is for you because you always been blue thank you and since you bring me herbs in the Box I made you dinner in the box with your trails afraid side
[Music] my friends are coming for a barbecue tonight it's gonna be gorgeous night we're gonna have hamburgers on the grill turkey sausages and I'm gonna make vegetable coleslaw to go with it it's gonna be delicious I've already sliced cabbage is white cabbage and red cabbage and I also like to slice the green part of the outer leaves because I think it really adds a lot to the salad and I'm just gonna slice the carrots and it's so easy to do in a food processor just put the carrots in actually sideways how fast is that just two more this is all the vegetables and what I do is in order to keep the colors from running the red cabbage from making everything else pink I just leave it in layers like that and then we're gonna make the sauce I can combine the whole thing together onto the sauce they're really traditional coleslaw ingredients I like it with a volume turned up cuz I don't like that sort of gloppy mayonnaise flavor I like to add something to thin it either chicken stock or in this case I'm gonna do a little bit of cider vinegar now Kevin's two cups of mayonnaise two tablespoons of cider vinegar a tablespoon of sugar just to make sure it's really nice and sweet the cabbage and then some good Dijon mustard quarter of a cup all of this is about giving it lots of good flavor okay I'm gonna put in 2 teaspoons of celery seed just gives a really good sort of fresh celery flavor 1 teaspoon of celery salt and a half a teaspoon of kosher salt half a teaspoon of good black pepper it's gonna mix that up now one of the good things about this is I can make it really early in the day and I leave the vegetables and the sauce separate and then just before going to serve it I can put it all together in fact I could even make it a few days in advance it's great love things that don't have to be made just before the party and that's it so when you go into the refrigerator and I'm ready for the party find a coke lemon sauce and smoothie delicious [Music]
I thought I'd make cream of wild mushroom soup to start because I can make the whole thing in advance and then just heat it up before dinner I'm starting with five ounces of each of three mushrooms portobello cremini and shiitake if you can't find all three just pick one okay nice clean mushrooms so the next step is to separate the mushroom stems from the calves that ones just can't take off the stems I love the nutty sort of meaty flavor of the wild mushrooms so chop the stems just a rough chop because it's all going to get cooked together and then for more flavor go chop the carrot any kind of vegetables you have that will flavor the stock it's great way to use them up okay so now it hit the canned tablespoon of olive oil tablespoon of butter and go the onions carrots and the mushroom stem these just will cook for about ten to fifteen minutes until they get really nice and caramelized and okay big sprig of thyme right in and let that cook when you get the rest of the soup ready so first thing when they use is the week and then you see at the grocery store but people don't use it so much here [Music] so you some butter and oil again so to get the best flavor of the butter in the best learning temperatures of the oil leaks go into the pin that's going to saute for about 15 to 20 minutes they have great flavor the meantime and then pour some water into the stock I need 6 cups of water since it's a similar way for best 30 minutes if you get the really rich mushroom stock and then later I'm going to add it to the soup okay so the next thing you want to do for the soup is cut up the mushroom caps I quarter half inch slices okay that's it for the mushrooms I'm just going to go into the pan with the leeks in the butter just give them a stir and those are going to cook for about 10 minutes until all the moisture from the mushroom this gets out into the soup okay now I'm going to strain the stock [Music] make every last bit okay so the next thing is add a little flour to these mushrooms it's amazing how much they cook down so I need a quarter of a cup of flour what this is going to do is thicken the soup set it right to the mushrooms cook it for a minute perfect I need a cup of dry white wine and if we have Anna frigerator it what smells great okay some fresh thyme leaves about teaspoon give it a stir and now I'm going to add the stock look how gorgeous that is just in the stem [Music] okay last ingredient put one cup of cream and then cup of half-and-half and 1/2 cup of fresh parsley give it a stir so I'm going to chill this and I'm going to heat it up just before dinner this is fantastic I think actually the best soup but I said look at Elijah's thank you really [Music]
[Music] my friend Barbara Beth's gorgeous daughter Cassandra is getting married this year and I've offered to help with the rehearsal dinner I believe in first impressions and last impressions so I've asked my friend Miguel to do two table settings for Cassandra to choose from and I'm making two over the top desserts first I'm making a baba of Rome which is a delicious cake made with yeast and then soaked and I mean soaked in rum syrup and second I'm giving her a choice with yo Flo Tom or floating island which is big mounds of meringue floating on a sea of vanilla creme anglaise and drizzled with caramel and pralines Cassandra's coming later to choose which table setting and which dessert she wants for her rehearsal dinner I think it's gonna be really hard to choose so the first dessert that I'm going to suggest for Cassandra's rehearsal dinner is a classic French bistro dessert and it's called Baba au Rhum or a rum Baba and what it is is it's a yeast cake made with currants and it's allowed to rise and it's soaked I mean we're talking soaked with rum syrup and it's absolutely delicious I've been making bubble room for Geoffrey I think since we first got married and I thought the santur would love it for her party okay that's really well buttered now I'm going to start making the cake so the first thing I need is warm milk you need 1/2 a cup of milk heated to 115 degrees that's the ball is really college one heat a little more but if you're not sure about 115 degrees use a thermometer pull one packet of yeast in there's a little bit of a process but you can do it in advance and then soak it just before you're going to serve it one packet of yeast and two tablespoons of sugar the sugar actually makes the yeast grow it's like food for the yeast I just stir it around clean hands you can do it with your fingers well it sit for about five minutes and leaves find it you'll see bubbles it's the carbon dioxide coming out of the knees and that's how you know it's aligned alive and with it and in the meantime I'm gonna soak the currants in rum mmm that's really everything in this cake is soaked in rum so I need third of a cup of currants that's a really great they're like raisins smaller and they're a little harder so I really like them and a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar it just has much more flavor just one tablespoon and just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just gonna soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling away in the bowl okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so the mixer on low speed I'm gonna put in me at first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't clump half a teaspoon of salt you always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft this is gonna make a really light dough and just let me tune okay perfect you're gonna see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right oh damn towel just a kitchen towel just slightly damp towel you don't want it soaking wet just enough so the dough doesn't dry out while it's rising okay I think I hear Miguel it's coming to due to table settings for Cassandra and I know that both gonna be so beautiful she'll never be able to choose hi time ago thank you so much for doing this every rehearsal table needs a good stylist and you're in so I got you all kinds of things I got you flowers and I got plates and napkins and glasses I did two different Clause you can change anything you like to say yeah I got two shapes I thought it'd be interesting for her choice of chicks right now and we'll we'll get the taste into good so the barroom dough has been sitting for a bed now and should be double in volume and it is it's perfect so the next thing I want to do is drain the currents these are soaked in rum I bet they're delicious I'd have to taste one make sure they're right mmm so good mmm I'm just gonna pour them into the dough so this is a yeast dough and it's got currants soaked in rum throughout the dough I'm gonna let it rise one more time and then soak it so this is a really sticky dough now and it's got all these currents in it it's beginning to smell rum like okay they're nicely distributed and now we're gonna do is put it into the cook of off malls you can see the devil it's really nice and don't be surprised it's really wet and sticky it is like wallpaper paste it just sticks to everything I think I'm gonna need a night for this just spread it around evenly in the pan it doesn't have to be perfect so I'm gonna put a damp cloth back on it let it rise for about 50 minutes until it's about double in volume and then I'm gonna bake it at 375 for about 30 minutes gonna be great and now I'm gonna make the sugar syrup [Music] so my bubble room is out of the oven and bake for 30 minutes at 375 and I just let it cool for about 10 minutes 15 minutes until I could starting to get it out of the pan this is just the moment of truth whether in fact I've greased it enough perfect oh isn't that Kourt just I'm always amazed myself so now I'm gonna do is make the rum syrup that soaks it it's gonna make it really good so the first thing you need is one and a half cups of water and a cup of sugar just cook this on high heat until the sugar dissolves you know I always thought that what this was originally a brioche that got stale and somebody said no let's just soak it in sugar syrup and see if it works and a little rum never hurts okay that was really fast I'm just gonna pour this into it and they have 2/3 of a cup of oil just experimenting a little bit usually the sugar syrup is that but I find that rum a little bit harsh and I found if I had a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract it just rounds out the flavor beautifully it's not a trauma hot syrup and now I'm just been very slowly pour it onto the cake so that it soaks in can you see it just absorbs all that gorgeous that's why you want the cake still to be warm when you do this and then afterwards I'm going to put a glaze on it to make it nice and shiny a little sweet and when it's sort of a big mound of whipped cream in the middle last bit of form syrup into the cake see I told you it would all go in every master huh okay now we're gonna make the apricot glaze so I'm gonna take a pan apricot preserves a spoon and just put about 3/4 of a cup of apricot jam into the pan add a tablespoon of water I'm just gonna keep this all together and then sieve it so it makes a nice thin clear glaze okay this just a six-second and then port right through the sieve okay most of my desserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion and it's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it we've got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just gonna brush it on the outside of the cake won't believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose but when I wonder which table setter she's gonna choose Cassandra is not decided where she's going to have the rehearsal dinner so I'm going to give her two options a round table which is slightly more Provencal more country like and this one which is more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we're going to use this very nice needs of ivy we're gonna create this nice little pattern in the middle looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas for the second dessert I'm gonna make breakfast Sandra it's called ear flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French Nursery dessert and I think she's going to just love it first thing I need to make us caramel sauce turn the heat on high really high so I've got 1/2 a cup of water and one and a half cups of sugar and I'm gonna cook it until it's a warm caramel brown color like a really rich color okay while that boils away I'm gonna start on the praline so I need one and a half cups of blanched sliced almonds you can find them in the grocery store know you can always smell this first it's just you can start to see the heat and just swirl it carefully it's just incredibly hot don't touch it just gonna turn it off I need 1/2 a cup of water I'm gonna add water and vanilla now this is the tricky part it's gonna bubble up violently so just stand back they need 1/2 a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and just stir this carefully and cook it until it's 230 degrees on a candy thermometer and it's gonna be just the right consistency he's gonna be pourable when it's at room temperature mmm you can smell that wonderful caramel the sort of burnt sugar and vanilla can be delicious okay we're there 230 degrees so I'm going to take about a quarter of a cup of the caramel you really careful this unbelievably hot just drizzle it right over and the rest of the caramel sauce I'm gonna say it for drizzling over the ill Fatone so just mix this up together make sure the almonds are coated in caramel spread it out on the pan I'm gonna bake this 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes until the almonds are nice and brown and crisp and then I'm going to sprinkle that over the top and then I'm gonna show you how easy the meringues are and they're just gorgeous [Music] so the next thing I'm going to make for Cassandra's ill float all is the islands or just meringue so I need eight egg whites at room temperature I'm gonna say the egg yolks for making the custard right into the mixer okay I'm just gonna put in a quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar that acts as a stabilizer for the egg whites and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and then turn it on high speed exciting frothy I'm gonna throw away at a cup of sugar a decent vanilla okay I'm gonna do really messy mounds of this on two sheet pans lined with parchment paper good news about meringues is they're not supposed to be perfect sort of messy and organic looking this isn't like the hard meringues that you get that are like cookies these are gonna be really soft meringues and melt in your mouth and because of the good vanilla I'll taste like vanilla clouds it's impossible to do this without getting it all over you and the kitchen into the oven 250 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're gonna have meringues I think Miguel's starting to work on a second table setting I can't wait to see it [Music] in case that Cassandra wants something more informal I'm going to give her this second option which I'm calling it the provençal table and as you can see this is sort of wheat color over cloth I decided to use very modern glasses for the water and stemware for the wine instead of having one centerpiece I decided to have three centerpieces I like this because it gives the idea it sort of emphasizes the idea of the round table so no matter where you look you have different flowers to look at round Square and wonder which one she will choose for the last part of my element is Kremlin glass so the first thing I need is 1 and 3/4 cups of milk and I want to scald it which means I'm gonna heat it to just under the boiling point okay in the meantime I'm gonna start making it's a very light custard so it's got egg yolks these are four egg yolks left over for making meringues okay and then half a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cornstarch [Music] and Oprah the milk is perfectly ready you see the bubbles around the outside and stuff before it's boiling actually it's easiest to pour it in as I born in this and report in very slowly otherwise you end up with scrambled eggs first search isn't always used they can come on with us but it acts as a stabilizer so it makes it easier to cook now looks great okay now goes back in the pan I'm gonna cook it over very low heat until it's just slightly thickens this isn't like pastry cream which is very thick this is really a thin sauce and then after it's cooked I'm gonna flavor it with amaretto and vanilla it's gonna be delicious so this is starting to thicken what it'll do is cut the spoon so a little bit more and be done perfect I'm gonna sip it just in case there are little particles and I know if there's anything cooked egg in it I think I just made it before it went too far look at that in that gorgeous okay one and a half teaspoons of amaretto which is almond liqueur mmm love the smell of that teaspoon of vanilla and you think I'll that's something to look like what it tastes like I think the seeds of half of Anila pod next I'm going to assemble the elf Lata and make some worm whipped cream for the bubble over [Music] Cassandra's gonna be here in a few minutes I want to assemble the ill Fatah and Baba au Rhum and time for her to get here first remember I made this wonderful creme on glass you can see the vanilla being specs in it I'm gonna make a puddle of it in the middle of this plate and then meringue islands right in the middle okay a drizzle of caramel sauce I've allowed it to cool so it's nice and thick and caramel and the last part is the praline almonds that I made earlier just crack them in big shards right on top of that meringue and caramel it's like heaven and the Baba au Rhum nice flat green leaf it's gonna be tough choice for Cassandra I don't know what I would choose now I'm just gonna fill this whole Center with whipped cream who wouldn't want to have that for dessert [Music] so these are the two desserts the first one is Baba au Rhum it's a cheesecake with currants that soaked in rum and of course it's filled with whipped cream okay and the second one is called a float top which is a floating island it's big meringues drizzled with caramel and then praline almonds sprinkled on the top so it's creamy on the bottom it's sort of light and fluffy in the middle and then crunchy on the top here's your test or you walk to it fantastic okay Miguel you have to taste - you don't get a vote but you get a taste only the bride gets a vote it was so much fun to make these what's the I think I like the floating island I do okay but I have to tell you if you wake up at 3 in the morning go oh my god it chose the wrong one you can choose the other one yeah oh I'm so glad Cheers another toaster to Santa Miguel for the tables so we have the previs all table and then we have the urban table I think I like the Provencal yeah I have more of a hydrangea theme at my wedding and I think I love something a little I totally agree I think it's gorgeous more desert I think we have to appeal flow Tom and Cassandra's on or right
[Music] my friend Michael the florist is invited me for lunch but now some of his clients have called with last-minute flower emergencies how annoying so instead of canceling I've offered to bring lunch to a shop and we can eat while he works we're going to start with juicy pink roasted shrimp with fasten Island dressing dip followed by delicious salmon on a bed of spicy lentils and for dessert pecan squares dipped in warm chocolate you've heard of store-bought food well there's a store-bought food and we can eat lunch at the counter among all the beautiful flowers so the first thing I thought I'd make for Michael is pecan bars it's really a pecan pie but in bars so we can pick them up and it starts with about 20 pounds of butter no no no really it's a pound and a quarter of butter see how light it is what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make like a shortbread crust on the bottom of the pan and then do that wonderful sweet caramel and pecans on the top so the first thing I do is one of the quarter pounds of butter 3/4 of a cup of sugar it's really just like making shortbread I'm just gonna cream that for about three minutes until it's light and fluffy okay turn it on low just enough to mix it we really want to start with room-temperature butter otherwise it really won't cream well okay the next thing is three eggs they're also room-temperature I think you'd be surprised how much your baking changes once you start using room-temperature butter mine did put in the eggs one at a time [Music] just let them get incorporated before you put the next one in otherwise you end up with a mess and now recursive teaspoon of vanilla and then while that's mixing I want to combine the flour baking powder and salt so I need four and a half cups of flour 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt and just sift it all together Parsippany really just make sure there are no lumps in the flour and it combines everything and now very slowly with a mixer on low speed just put the flour mixture into the butter mixture these are great for a party or for a picnic because you can make them in advance and they transport really well I'm gonna dip them in chocolate it's gonna make them even better okay that's the crust I don't have a sheet pan and then Pat it out with my hands that looks like a lot of dough and it's just the crust okay I'm gonna flour my hands a little bit just to check this out it'll help much better but it's a lot of dough this is sort of the same kind of crust that used for lemon bars all kinds of bars it's really good with pecan bars just make a little bit of an edge so that the filling stays inside I love anything that doesn't require rolling it out with a rolling pin or greasing the pan you know one thing I really believe about being a good friend is being really flexible and when Michael said he was crazy busy I thought I'm not just bring a picnic to the store a lot of lunch well he works good 350 degrees for 15 minutes until the crust is set but not brown [Music] [Music] so the shortbread base is cooled and set and the next thing I have to do for my pecan bars is the filling needs just a little more butter one pound remember it makes a lot of pecan bars so what I'm gonna do is cook a few ingredients together to make the topping and then add lots and lots of pecans I'm just gonna turn that on if I want to melt it next thing is brown sugar brown sugar is granulated sugar and molasses mixed together and one pound is two and a quarter cups I need three cups all together and then this is about 3/4 of a cup and the last thing is 1 cup of honey this is really just the filling for the pecans to hold them all together perfect so we're gonna do is just stir it all together and melt it and then I'm gonna turn the heat up a high and boil it for about three minutes so it really caramelize does it it gets nice and thick mmm it smells pretty good already don't even have the pecans in yet okay while that's heating I'm gonna add to zest so about a teaspoon of lemon zest we love you as exists I actually think most of the flavor of the lemons in the zest so that's about a teaspoon put that right in at a teaspoon of our excess okay when that comes to a boil just boil away for about three minutes and it'll get really syrupy and thick do 1/4 cup of heavy cream and two pounds of pecans is delicious and I actually buy chopped pecans instead of cold one why I've chopped them when you can buy them already chopped okay I'm going to mix that all together it's not some gorgeous mmm be careful this is really hot you don't want to get anywhere near it and certainly don't put your fingers in it to taste it shortbread crust then pour this whole thing right on top one thing I learned is sometimes this bubbles over a little in the oven so I put a piece of aluminum foil on the bottom of the oven to floor that's certainly easier to throw away the aluminum foil than it is to clean the oven and just spread it all out it's not like delicious okay all done so into the oven 350 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes until they've set and when they're cool I'm gonna dip them in chocolate those are good [Music] I'm gonna make some chocolate for the pecan bars so I'm gonna melt 1/2 pound of chocolate chips and 1/2 a cup of heavy cream it's a ganache I'm gonna dip the pecan bars in chocolate you don't really have to but I mean why not and one teaspoon of coffee it's instant coffee granules truly boosts the flavor of the chocolate you don't really taste the coffee chocolate tastes better big spoon for stirring so put this in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water just want to make sure that water really just simmers and while that melts i'm gonna cut the pecan bars just for this really carefully because the knife can slip that's just like brownies the first one's always hard to get out that doesn't that look fabulous I actually think I'm gonna make these a little smaller I think they're really too big so I'm gonna cut them in half and then we'll dip them in chocolate [Music] nice fella great okay got four of them no they're the rest later it looks like the chocolates just melted perfect so I'm going to turn it off actually a little bit before it melts because the heat from the pot just keep melting that look good what wouldn't be better different chocolate okay I'm just gonna get it all set up now so what I use is the white paper muffin cups just to flatten it out and then put the pecan bar on top and then flatten it out this allow the chocolate to dry a little bit it's never gonna get really hard but it'll just allow it to dry a little bit and they won't all smush together okay first one dip it right here just the edge you know what the whole thing just enough so you get a sense of the chocolate right back on them Michaels originally from Pennsylvania Dutch country what makes me think this is kind of deserved how's that this is quite a production making two for Michael and me an enormous number for customers a lot of pecan bars [Music] I'd love to make things that are traditional but with the twist and so instead of making boiled shrimp with cocktail sauce what I'm going to do is I'm gonna make roasted shrimp has lots of flavor and but the shrimp already peeled and deveined a little bit of olive oil just a drizzle salt some pepper I like a little lemon juice in this it's so much easier than all that boiling water perfect okay I'm just gonna mix it up turn on a sheet pan this is just for two so it's about a half a pound I like when the tails are still on you can use them to pick them up 400 degrees for about 5 to 6 minutes and they're gonna have so much more flavor than boiled shrimp I like cocktail sauce as well as anybody but I just thought with shrimp let's shake it up a little bit so I'm gonna make Thousand Island dip which is basically Russian dressing with pickles in it doesn't that sound like it'll be good together so 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise 1/4 of a cup of ketchup but try and get it in the bowl okay now all different kinds of things in it tablespoon of pickle relish teaspoon of capers I actually drained them first just like that doesn't have to be perfect and then I put some of these little girl cans in they should have like cornichon but little American gherkins not French once this is a very American dish just chop them up roughly you could probably just use one kind of pickles but I like to give it more flavor okay it's a little too much but it's just gonna be better okay a little bit of lemon juice add a teaspoon salt and pepper and that's Thousand Island dip for roasted shrimp put in the silver ball that looks good [Music] oh they look great you can tell when they're done they start to get pink and when you press them they don't really give any resilience they're firm those gonna be great just put them right around doesn't have to be perfect it's a nice arrangement this is perfect for Michael and me okay this needs a little green maybe some parsley it's a few sprigs Wow so that's the first course the main course I'm making salmon with lentils I'd say that's really delicious take out [Music] Samuel Flynn tells it's a great party dish because you can make it in huge quantities but for two it's also perfect so I'm gonna make it for Michael and me but first I'm gonna make the lentils I'm gonna pour boiling water over the top and just let them soak for about ten minutes so they soften so I'm gonna put the lentils aside I'm gonna saute all kinds of vegetables cook the lentils with it and then so to have the salmon separately and put it together a little bit of olive oil I have two cups of onions it's gonna saute them together and two cups of weeks they're both pretty much in the same family the leeks are a little more delicate than the onions they're great together and some fresh thyme that a teaspoon none of this has to be exact because saute this for about ten minutes until the onions translucent booboo sauce pepper and while that's cooking I'm gonna cut up some carrot and celery put in a tablespoon of chopped garlic [Music] and then we're gonna have cups of chopped celery one and a half cups of chopped carrots since it's really chunky it's got lots of flavor and the lentils are just part of it it's gonna saute that for a second 1/2 cups of chicken stock and who to have a spoons of tomato paste stir it in we're gonna add the lentils I'm gonna cook these together for about 20 minutes the lentils and the vegetables then I'm gonna sear the salmon and then I'm off to Michael's second mission done boy am I ready for I'm gonna take out lunch the key to the salmon is to just sear the outside so you make a really crisp crust and then it seals in all that flavor drizzle this with a little bit of oil okay that's it salt and pepper this is really the only season we so you want to make sure you season it really well okay really hot pan just make sure you can really feel it and then take the salmon and put it in seasoned side down and just leave it I know it's really tempting to move it around but you want to really create a really great crust so I'm just gonna cook it on this side for about two minutes and then flip it over and roast it in the oven and it'll be perfect it's sort of crusty on the outside and tender inside okay two minutes let's turn it over okay into the oven for about five to seven minutes at 450 degrees this is how they cook it in restaurants and it comes out perfectly let's go finish the lentils and them off to Michael [Music] well the Salmons perfectly cooked that's gonna be wonderful so a little bit left to do on the lentils so I'm gonna add about two tablespoons of red wine vinegar just really sort of perks up the flavor a lot I don't see how this is mmm I can smell it I love when it hits the heat mmm that's delicious one more salt always needs a little more mmm the sweetness of the red wine vinegar and the carrots and lentils gonna be great with the salmon so I'm something a platter and just fill it up mmm the good news is it's good hot but it's also good room-temperature salmon on top then the leftovers I'm gonna put in the refrigerator love leftovers don't have to cook tomorrow night I'm gonna pack all this up pick up the pecan bars and the shrimp a Thousand Island dip and I'm off to Michael's so I brought lunch for it has that fabulous I had to make this rumor wellactually roasted them it's amazing big sheet pan salt and pepper olive oil in the oven it's really fast and I just think it has so much more flavor yeah I'm ready for salmon yes salmon and lentils one of my favorite this couldn't have been better I think you're gonna like what's more picky and bars dipped in chocolate help yourself huh we're gonna need a nap after lunch it's really unfair I'm so glad you brought lots oh very happy something as a thank you you don't have to do that but I love surprises [Music] thank you Feeny's they really are my favorite boys are fabulous they're so beautiful thing I can bring you lunch anytime that's a deal
[Music] my friend Patricia is coming after a really long trip from Paris and I thought wouldn't it be nice to just greet her with like big steaming bowls of chili but since she's being really good I thought maybe I instead of making beef chili I'd make chicken chili so I've got about four cups of onions and 2 tablespoons of olive oil and they've cooked until you can really smell them at 10 minutes and I'm going to add lots of good stuff 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic who's going to be really good one of cook garlic for just a minute because it really bitter and 2 yellow peppers and 2 red peppers it's a really quick way to cut peppers just straight down and then what's left over you can use for snacking and I'm just going to do big chunks kind of chili should be big chunks of good stuff so peppers okay now all the good spices first thing of course is chili powder so I've got huge spoon of chili powder teaspoon of cumin which is a really essential ingredient in all chili and then these are the things that make it hot red pepper just sort of a pinch of it maybe a quarter teaspoon and then cayenne pepper which is really hot so use it at your own risk I like when things have a lot of flavor and a little bit of heat but if you like it really hot just add more so two teaspoons of salt this is great and I'm going to cook that for about a minute while I get the tomatoes ready I always get this is canned tomatoes life's too short to peel a tomato so I'm just going to chop them up really quickly within two 28 ounce cans of tomatoes try not to get it all over the kitchen like I do and into the sauce give this there so most chili has cilantro in it but I personally hate cilantro so I'm going to put basil in instead it gives it great flavor let's take the leaves off and just give it a really rough chop so maybe that a quarter of a cup should be good wonderful so it's going to cook for about 30 minutes so this is a chicken that I cooked on the bone with the skin on it and it really keeps it moist I just tested all different kinds of ways of doing this and I found it's so much better roasting it than it is to boil it the way you normally do it for a chicken like this the church is on a book tour for her new book Provence I can't wait to see it so just sort of tear off this bone with your hands so that's way to do it big shots wanted to be really delicious and chunky right into the pot just stir it around just going to fill for about 20 minutes all the flavors get into the chicken chilli cumin basil tomatoes so we got all kinds of toppings g gajala a little sour cream yeah that were cream for the ship did you just create this like in the shower one well you know I always my beef chili and I'd be healthier if I made chicken jus like so I just particular instead brilliant it's been a good one Geoffrey
[Music] when I used to cater parties the client once asked me to do a really fancy dinner and have ice cream sandwiches for dessert and I thought that's kind of an odd idea but she was the client well the party was a great success everybody had a really good time my friends are coming tonight and I thought maybe I'll borrow her idea it's really really fun [Music] who doesn't love ice cream I think it used to be considered just for children but then the grown-ups caught on so I'm gonna make this wonderful ice cream it's Philadelphia ice cream which is three cups of heavy cream 2/3 of a cup of sugar you not gonna believe how easy this is a teaspoon of vanilla we love vanilla and then vanilla bean I have this wonderful brew that I make it's vanilla beans and it's vodka and they just sit in the bucket and it makes a vanilla extract but it also makes this wonderful softened vanilla bean where I'll show you you can cut off the end and they just put the seeds right into the ice cream they just squeeze right out and it's just wonderful but if you don't have this brew you can also buy vanilla bean in a store usually comes 1/2 a package and slice it right down the middle and then with your knife just scrape it out and you can see the seeds just goes right into the it's like good vanilla ice cream when you can see the seeds and then you mix this up what I'm gonna make is ice cream sandwiches and they're gonna be chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies and in between we're gonna put the vanilla Armagnac ice cream it's gonna be so good so all I'm gonna do is just strain the cream and the vanilla make sure everything is dissolved beautifully and it is this looks great so I'm gonna chill it get it nice and cold and then put it in the ice cream freezer and now I'm gonna go do some shopping [Music] the ice-cream sandwiches are really messy we're gonna need lots of white napkins now this be a great bowl to put in the freezer and then I can serve the ice cream from it these ice cream scoops are so good for everything from muffins to cookies but if I make cookies with this when they do that big another time so I think I'll use this one for ice cream and this smaller one for cookies can't wait [Music] so I'm going to start the cookies with half a pound of room-temperature butter it's really great when it's room temperature I just think it's an important part of baking I actually leave it out overnight and then you know it's really room temperature and then a cup of white sugar a cup of brown sugar butter and sugar how bad can that be I'm cream it on medium speed and then I'm gonna add two eggs and they also it's great when they're room temperature crack it on the table rather than the edge of the bowl then you don't get any egg shell in the bowl I'm gonna pour these in to the mixture sort of one at a time so they incorporate just scrape the bowl down to make sure everything is really well incorporated so I'm just going to stir that a little bit okay the next thing is vanilla two teaspoons of good vanilla and 2/3 of a cup of cocoa powder this is the unsweetened cocoa powder it's not like the cocoa that you make hot cocoa front that has sugar added to it and sometimes flavorings oh nice cocoa everywhere they're two-thirds of a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and that's what gives it its really good chocolate flavor mix that around the next thing is flour and the leavening so I have two cups of flour a teaspoon of baking soda teaspoon of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt just really make sure there aren't any little hard particles in the flour the baking powder perfect and then this goes into the cookies turn on low speed this is the point where you don't want to over mix the flour because then it'll develop the gluten and make it taste more like bread than cookies one of them really really delicate and tender and that's the dough I'm just gonna mix it a little bit I mean remember clean hands are a cook's best tools so I'm just gonna take all the batter off the beater make sure we make it into cookies this looks great okay put the white chocolate in this saw the white chocolate that I cut up and I just cut it off this block and sort of nice big chunks and let's pour in two cups of white chocolate into this this makes a huge batter but you can actually make this really early and you can save it and refrigerator or even freeze it for later so it's a great recipe and now just to scoop them there's a little bit of a decadent dessert you know how girls are when boys aren't around so I use an ice cream scoop for this and it makes exactly the right size each time just one level ice-cream scoop it's a small one and these guys are gonna spread out too I'm gonna make eight cookies two for each of the ice cream sandwiches so everybody's gonna make their own Ice Cream Sandwich gonna have the cookies and the vanilla Armagnac ice cream and then everybody make their own which is great because it's fun to make them but it's also then I don't have to do them myself so just with a little bit of water just i wet my hand just a smidge and just press it down ever so slightly and you'll see the all spread out so they're really sort of soft and chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside okay into the oven 350 degrees for exactly 15 minutes they're gonna be so good with the ice cream I've girlfriend's coming for dinner and I'm making ice cream sandwiches with chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies ice snow I get done great so since we're having really bad ice cream sandwiches for dessert I'm gonna make a really good tuna salad nicoise for dinner and I'm gonna start with all kinds of provençale ingredients like these wonderful potatoes so I'm gonna make it to a French potato salad they're everywhere so I bought 10 pounds of potatoes I like to mix the white and the red potatoes and what I'm gonna do is just slice these really thickly and then put them in a bowl with a vinaigrette you know usually we're used to an American potato salad which is all that gloppy man is which I actually think sort of you lose the flavor of the potatoes when you do that this is a salad where I'm gonna slice the potatoes and infuse them with a vinaigrette and fresh herbs and I think it really brings out that gorgeous sort of earthy potato flavor it's gonna be just delicious absolutely fabulous the Sal is actually sort of an homage to my favorite cook of all times - Leah child and her wonderful book mastering the Art of French Cooking she has a French potato salad that I think I've been making for decades since I first got married and I just love it so this is very similar to to eat on its original salad okay these are almost done and then what I'm going to do while it's still warm this gives it so much flavor it's about two tablespoons but a nice splash of white wine you can use leftover one from dinner last night and a splash of chicken stock and while the potatoes are still warm it really gets into the potatoes big spoon just toss it all together some salt and pepper what the potatoes just have as much flavor as possible before you start when that fits a little bit just for a few minutes all the chicken stock and the wine gets into the potatoes and so delicious so that's the potatoes and the next thing I'm gonna make is gonna grab so the key ingredients for a good vinaigrette are good vinegar and good olive oil them too this is champagne vinegar but if you have good cider vinegar or white wine vinegar it's great I just wouldn't use red wine vinegar for this and then I'm gonna add that I have a teaspoon of Dijon mustard and salt and pepper for some reason I think Americans are really sort of daunted by vinaigrette it's the easiest thing in the world and so much better than that bottled stuff you get and then slowly pour good olive oil into this and you make an emulsion but muster it seems to emulsify the vinaigrette so it stays together cuz I can't make no mayonnaise just do the olive oil slowly and then this vinaigrette it's gonna be wonderful both on the potatoes but also we're gonna use it later to pour over the other ingredients like the auricle there and the salad just was there's only one way to tell if it's right it's actually perfect maybe a drop more olive oil but it's just right great so this is just gonna go on the potatoes just to flavor them and that's all gonna soak into those warm potatoes and the rest I'm gonna save for later and now the last thing is lots of fresh herbs and that's what gives the potato such a fresh flavor so we have chopped scallions chopped them already give them another rough cut I really like when they're roughly cut unlikely to be so precision like that you don't actually see what it is gives you a sense that there's scallions in it what kind of or justice lips and fresh basil just take the leaves off you can either do this with a rough chop or you can do it julienne but I think I'm just gonna do it roughly chopped okay lots of fresh basil and then fresh dill it's a great way to take the leaves off the deal it's just run your knife along and takes all those leaves off without pulling them off one by one just think how much flavor these potatoes have when you're done with a warm vinaigrette and the fresh basil and dill czar the pungent herbs and it just looks so fresh and it's so much better than all that mayonnaise and then the longer just soaks in the fridge and the longer it sits the better it tastes so mmm there's a really tender but they're still firm enough so they have flavor you could use a little more salt that's my motto it always needs more salt a little more pepper bring out the flavors and it's gonna be just delicious and that big platter with our salad nicoise done into the fridge [Music] and after my homemade ice cream this is a sweetened cream flavored with incredible vanilla the only thing I'm gonna add to give it a little kick at some Armagnac oh it's gonna be wonderful Armagnac has cognac from the Gascony region of France and it's gonna get my vanilla ice cream incredible flavor into the ice cream machine turn it on and in 15 minutes and Anila Armagnac ice cream it'll be so good and I'm gonna go set the table it's got to be really simple but gorgeous and since we're having ice cream for dessert I thought it'd be really fun dat ice cream colors so we've got like raspberry sorbet and orange is like orange sherbert just wonderful so very simple and there are four of us glasses I love to mix fancy things and simple things so we have fancy glasses and really simple plates so since the cloth is raspberry I've got white place I'm big on white plates I think food looks best on a white plate but it creates a little contrast which is nice white napkins and it's fun to mix old things and new things so I have really good old glasses and then my everyday silver so it's no reason why it has to be fancy or simple it can be both okay and finally for the flowers now if you think I always have these flowers around a friend sent me this incredible gift of roses and they have the most incredible scent so right in the middle and everything's done and now I can finish the dinner so my girlfriends are coming for dinner I'm making a tuna SWA's for dinner and these incredible ice cream sandwiches for dessert and I'm doing it with my vanilla army of ice cream oh this looks just perfect it's perfectly churned and so what I'm gonna do is freeze it a little more because of the Armagnac it's a little bit soft and then we're gonna put it out in a big bowl and everybody's gonna make their own ice cream sandwiches with chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies how wonderful is that sound I think I'd taste this and make sure it's okay mmm it's wonderful you taste all the good vanilla and the Armagnac it's gonna be great so I'm gonna put it in a container and freeze it for a little while get nice and firm the good news about this is I can make it the day before the party or even the month before the party so I don't have a thing to do when my guests arrive so that's it for the vanilla Armagnac ice cream it's gonna be so delicious with a chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies I'm gonna freeze it for a little while until it gets a little harder and I want to freeze the ball so we have something nice to serve it in so the next thing is a Tuna Nicoise platter and the first thing I'm going to do is get this pan incredibly hot so I can sear the tuna and it's gonna be really good and that's gonna sit there for like five minutes this is a kind of platter you can put anything in the like that has sort of Provencal feel about it this is watercress you can use arugula anything that's really beautiful and fresh and then after I assemble this whole thing I'm gonna serve a vinaigrette and everybody can help themselves so that's the watercress and the next thing is I've got some string beans that have boiled for about three minutes gonna drain them and then put them in ice water and that really shocks them so not chalk like up there shock like that they're shocked so they're staying really green and they get really cold fast so that's perfect so after that when I put them on the platter like this and we've got potato salad the Provencal potato salad which is made with vinaigrette and fresh herbs rather that's sort of gloppy American manners put that in the middle of this platter that looks so good and the next thing is hard-boiled eggs its traditional for a salad nicoise and then I've got gorgeous white and the yellow yolks I like to undercook the egg so that the yolks are bright yellow if you cook them too long you get a little dark circle over their yolks not pretty okay eggs and then of course you have it olives what protocell dish doesn't have olives on it and group things it's really important not to have it sort of look like a bowl of M&amp;M so I group things together so colors are similar now I like anchovies I don't know about you few people think they taste like hairy fish so I'm gonna put them in one place so you can either include them or not include them if you like them and the last thing is the tuna so the two for just two mistakes I'll show you how we do this who's gonna slather with a little bit of olive oil both sides and seasoned with lots of salt and then just put it right in the pan and the good news is this whole thing is going to cook one and a half minutes on each side and it's done Wow I think I might even put a little pepper on it now so this is gonna cook for about a minute and a half on one side I'm going to flip it over for a minute and a half on the other side and it will be perfectly cooked you want to make sure that the inside is actually still raw because if tuna is overcooked it just gets dry and tasteless and this way it's wonderful okay flip it over to the other side another minute and a half and it's going to be absolutely perfect for killing your wife clatter so the last thing before the guests arrive is I'm gonna get the ice cream ready in a bowl so I have nothing to do when they're here except to have fun this is the vanilla Armagnac ice cream and it's gonna be sandwiched between two chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies how decadent is that it's gonna be so delicious and I'd love to have it in a frozen ball so it's all ready to go to the table and I have nothing else to do except to have fun okay into the freezer for our ice cream sandwiches [Music] how's this for dinner a child thanks probably the only things to ever hit doesn't have butter in it I'm gonna try to be polite thank you what's really that undercooking isn't it it's almost like sushi so good the best part of this is all prepared in advance it's circling temperature so whenever your friends arrive it's ready we will all be going home and maejima so since we were really good for dinner we can be really bad for dessert with an ice cream soon so I'm taking my scoop of ice cream is it chocolate white chocolate chunk cookie a scoop of vanilla Armagnac eyes and another cookie for you this looks pretty good actually [Music] allora that looks good and terrific Jessa batiks you see two large cookies at the same time [Laughter] [Music]
you [Music] tradition is really the glue that keeps us together I've invited my friends for an all-american grill and I'm making the classic hamburgers fresh corn salad coleslaw and for dessert an all-american surprise in the summer when the fields here are filled with gorgeous corn I love to make fresh corn salad you're not going to believe how easy this is so I've boiled corn for about three minutes until it's just not starchy and the way you can tell is just to take a little kernel off and taste it so you still have the fresh corn flavor and it's perfect they're crisp but they're cooked all the way through and I'm going to put them in ice water it's called shocking them it's going to be so good with my all-american grill and hamburgers and instead of hotdogs I'm going to do turkey sausages and homemade coleslaw and a surprise for dessert okay so that's nice too so you know putting in an ice water actually stops the cooking but what else it does is it keeps the bright yellow color and we wanted to look for just takes a little hand off right there and just stand it up in a three hour end and then run your knife all the way down the cob and the kernels have come off beautifully like that when the corns fresh in these Campton I feel like I want to eat it every day especially surprising how much corn you get from the kernels of me okay five corn right into the bowl then I'm just going to add a few ingredients that will really give us all of its fresh corn flavor so the first thing on the ad is a little red onion one of the trick for cutting an onion is to lead the end one end on and then it keeps the whole thing together when you're coming up so I'll show you how this works so slice it this way keep your fingers out of the room and this way the whole thing stays together when you're dicing it so I need about half a cup of red onion which is one small red onion okay that's done all right a little bit of cider vinegar and olive oil I think the cider vinegar is really wonderful it's sort of sweet and it enhances the fresh corn flavor three tablespoons of each also Wow good olive oil salt and pepper always good salt and pepper the last ingredient is fresh basil I just think corn and they will go really well together so I put them together so this is a really great little trick how to julienne basil leaves and you just stack them up one on top of the other and then roll them up like a type cigar and then take a knife and just do really change slices and end up with really gorgeous julienned or sometimes called shippin odd okay just like that toss it up it's so fresh tasting perfect now how are you with that [Music] now I need some bread from my own American Grill he's not the place for sun-dried tomato focaccia pickle relish you've gotta have ketchup steak sauce my secret ingredient I put it in the hamburgers instead of on top of them good [Music] you can't have an all-american grill without having hamburgers but of course I want them to be the best hamburgers I can make I'm going to show you how to make really great hamburgers I actually like to combine two kinds of these I do ground chuck for the next day's really moist in the bowl and this is the ground sirloin it's got a little more flavor than the ground chuck it's a little drier and the fun thing about this is all about getting your hands into it next thing I have a two tablespoons of steak sauce how messy is that but it's really good and six egg yolks and one and a half teaspoons of salt actually what like kosher salt just has a little softer flavor than regular table so use it and everything requires a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and this is the messy part clean hands really important in cooking and I just find if you use a fork this all gets mashed together but if you use your hand you can keep it really nice and light oh it's so squishy and cold it's the only way to make really good hamburger and now for the real secret inside each hamburger I put a little pot of butter so hamburger and just taking like a half of this bit of butter and put it right in the middle and when it sits on the grill it's going to keep the hamburger so moy just want to make sure it's totally enclosed in hamburger [Music] roll it like that Pat it down flat focus of glory I'm gonna serve this of all kinds of good relish that's really traditional one hamburger relish ketchup mustard nothing unusual no chutney here it's not the time I'm really thinking about making very traditional things make me the best of class so people say hamburgers but then they go at least for the best 10 burgers I've ever had that's what I like like hiding a secret the middle of a hamburger like the Cracker Jack in the Box fabulous hamburgers ready for the grill [Music] my friends are coming for barbecue and it's gonna be gorgeous night we're going to have hamburgers on the grill turkey sausages and I'm going to make vegetable coleslaw to go with it to be delicious I've already sliced cabbage as white cabbage and red cabbage and I also like to slice the green part of the outer leaves I think it really adds a lot to the salad and I'm just going to slice the carrot and it's so easy doing a food processor just put the carrots in actually sideways how fast is that just two more and piece of the cook this is all the vegetables and what I do is in order to keep the colors from running the red cabbage from making everything else pink I just leave it in layers like that and then when I make the sauce I can combine the whole thing together onto the sauce they're really traditional coleslaw ingredient I like it with a volume turned up I don't like a sort of gloppy mayonnaise flavor I like to add something to spin it either chicken stock or and this kids going to do a little bit of cider vinegar now Kevin took up the manage two tablespoons of cider vinegar a tablespoon of sugar to make sure it's really nice enjoyed the cabbage and then some good Dijon mustard quarter of a cup all of this is about getting it laughs with good flavor okay I'm going to put in 2 teaspoons of celery seed just get their really good for the fresh celery flavor 1 teaspoon of celery salt and half a teaspoon of kosher salt half a teaspoon good black pepper you can mix that up now one of the good things about this is I can make it really early in the day and I leave the vegetables and the sauce separate and then just performing a service I can put it all together in fact I can even make it a few days in advance it's great I love things that don't have to be made just before the party and that's it so we go into the refrigerator and I'm ready for the party all I have to do is combine a cola on the sauce and it will be delicious I really hate it when I buy a really gorgeous tablecloth and then somebody inevitably spilled red wine on it so what I've started to do is buy fabric a fabric store I've got this blue and white cloth for my all-american grill I thought it's very appropriate and then I'm going to make a ham with this tape it's sort of sticky tape and what you do is put it underneath the hem and then roll the top over I can't believe how easy to sue and design it so that's the hem and who cares if somebody spilled red wine now enough of a surprise what can be better for an all-american gril than a flag cake this wonderful cake it's a sponge cake and the whole thing is decorated to look like an American flag with fresh blueberries and raspberries and cream cheese frosting how bad can that be so what I started with is two and a quarter stick of butter in the mixer and three cups of sugar and now I'm going to crush six eggs and put them in two at a time this is the stage where you really can't over beat it sugar the butter and the eggs the only time you really want to be careful is when you start adding the flour just make sure it's really well mixed that's great okay the next ingredient of sour cream it's a little unusual for a cake but it really gives it a nice richness so one cup of sour cream and it's let in wanting to have teaspoons of vanilla good vanilla extract now the dry ingredients we're going to do is just mix together three types of flour 1/3 of a cup of corn starch teaspoon of baking soda and teaspoon of kosher salt now unload speed I'm going to put this into the batter very slowly until it's totally incorporated it's the only time to make sure the mixture is not on high could you'll be wearing the flower and that you mix it just until its neck and that's it I'm going to put it in the pan and bake it this is called a half sheet pan and I've lined it with a little parchment paper so it'll come out after I finish baking no point in making a cake if you can't get it out of the pan okay just smooth at the top that's I've got it all over me in the kitchen it's all part of cake baking that's it and then later what I'm going to do is I'm going to decorate this to look like a flag with cream cheese frosting where as berries and blueberries could be green okay that's nice and smooth into the oven 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes and I can't wait to decorate it so now you get the barbecue ready set my table for the All American Grill but first cake smells like it's done perfect so now to get the grill hot this is my secret weapon it's a charcoal chimney and it's really great for starting a fire without any lighter fluid so what I do is I take paper - she seemed to work perfectly and put it in the bottom and then turn it over and fill the top with charcoal and then just light it and it works all by itself no pouring lighter fluid on a lift fire just a little bit of paper and charcoal and in 20 minutes you've got a really hot fire so as soon as these coals are hot really hot I'm going to dump it out into the barbecue and we'll have a really hot grill okay and now the table so I thought so my all-american grill would be really fun to have red white and blue but I have to shake it up a little bit so blue stripe cloth and instead of red flowers it wouldn't be great to have Tomatoes they're bright red they're summery and they look great on the table we're going to do two big plates in the middle really colorful tomato it's a crack these are Israeli tomatoes on the vine and they're just wonderful and then we can have tomato salad later and what I know from my retailing experiences green leaves make all the vegetables look so much better so what I'm going to do is I have some lemon leaves because you can really can get in the florist and they're so useful if they were different okay that's the centerpiece nice red tomato the next thing it's a place I'm big on white plates and glasses this is the time for stemware this is the time for just good simple glasses and then napkins I've got a big bowl I'm going to fill it with beer and soda and ice travel clothes I just like to go around and make sure everybody's place setting it's exactly the way you'd want them to find it I'm making a really easy buttercream frosting for my slide cake doesn't get any easier than this it's butter cream cheese confectioner sugar and vanilla amount of the decoration a fun part so this is a sponge that I made in the shape of a flag on a half sheet pan I'm going to do is about three-quarters of the icing on the cake and then decorate it with the rest which you see a parade move it out and now for the fun part I'm going to draw this space where the blue background goes for the stars just like that and then I'm going to fill the whole square in with blueberries it's actually kick that uses really simple ingredients but look so dramatic this takes a little bit of time but you can do it really early in the day okay last row of blueberries okay that's the blue background now the red stripe I want to make two rows of raspberries these are gorgeous big raspberries from California and then two rows of white icing will use a huge pastry bag so to fill it with more buttercream icing if you're not comfortable with typing icing I'll show you what you want to do just try it right on the counter on a board or something like that you can do stripes or if it's easy you can just do stars in a row I'm going to do the stripes let's just keep doing that until it's comfortable for you okay lots of gorgeous striped and okay another row Brassard has this look so far another row strike and the last thing is that stars on the blue field just like that how great does that work and that's an All American flag check so good [Music] so my friends are here on having all American Grill and that requires hamburgers but instead of hotdogs I'm going to do turkey sausages I like really traditional things that I also like to shake it up a little bit that's all set two more things to go and dinner served a few last-minute things while the hamburgers are grilling you make a coleslaw I saw the white cabbage red cabbage carrots and the coleslaw dressing with mustard and so racine celery salt okay that's good it's all ready to go serve it in the glass ball I've corn salad and I get the hot dog rolls and the hamburger rolls ready old-fashioned hot dog rolls for the turkey sausages it can be great just because they're simple rules doesn't mean they can't be beautifully presented and hamburger rolls the hamburger and everybody can put them on the grill if they want to or not now what else I need tomatoes and onions since I've decorated the table with tomatoes thought that would be great to have them in the meal I just want to have all the really traditional things that people like to have ham hamburgers and hotdogs and slice right onions for those who like red onions okay so separate the Rings so somebody doesn't get a big chunk of onion okay onions and tomatoes are done right in my basket and the only thing left of the relishes I've got old-fashioned pickle relish tickles and got to have ketchup nothing fancy here from my all-american grill we have a party okay everybody hamburgers and turkey what do you hold about who would that be who could that possibly be oh oh oh Gorger when I'm in town I found a new place with butter in the middle of the night well the ticket to the sauce is often size size of burgers instead of on top and for the grand finale flag do you think isn't a frosting I know I did I was very carefully got here I said sister okay shall we [Music] thank you for you Geoffrey would you like seconds yeah [Laughter] [Music]
[Music] my friend Joe tie redesigned my new garden so in return I've decided to make him lunch while he plants the walled herb garden I'm making him a delicious fresh green pea soup and serving it with a dollop of creme fraiche then we'll have roasted pepper and goat cheese sandwiches with basil from the garden and when his work is done we'll have a big slice of carrot and pineapple cake to celebrate so I thought maybe soup a sandwich I'm nice cake for dessert that would be nice so I'm gonna make fresh pea soup and I'm gonna start the soup with one leek so I've just used the light green parts and white parts and then thinking about leek says they're really good but they have a lot of dirt in them so you want to be sure that they're really well clean I'm cutting them in quarters and then you can see the dirt inside so I'm just gonna wash them really well just do this really carefully make sure you get all the sand out in between the leaves took the smallest amount can ruin the most delicious soup okay that should be good so I'm just gonna chop these up roughly the soups pureed so there's really no need to make it perfectly chopped just big rough chop okay so into the pot just about a tablespoon of butter one cup of chopped leeks okay so the next thing I want to do is I need 1/2 a cup of onion leeks have a very mild flavor and onions have a little more strength so it gives it a little more complex flavor okay simple onion chopping keep your fingers out of the way and this way if you leave the root intact the whole onion stays together it's much easier than it's scrambling across the board okay into the pan with the butter on the leeks big spoon give it a stir so these are gonna cook for about about 10 minutes until the onions and the leeks are really tender sort of translucent it's actually a great day cuz Joe gets to garden I get to cook we all get to do exactly what we want to do and then we have a good lunch any chicken stock I like to make my own and peas so the first thing I do is put in two cups of chicken stock I really like to use homemade chicken stock but if you don't have it use a can and I'm just cooking away in the kitchen I just throw some chicken and vegetables into a big pot let it boil away for four hours and you have really good chicken stock and peas this is the key I actually use frozen peas because I think they're better in this fresh peas by the time they get to market they're a little sort of starchy these 10 ounces of frozen peas so I'm just gonna let this cook for about three minutes remember they're blanched before they're put in the package so they're already pretty cooked [Music] it's actually a really specific flavor I don't use it very much because it tends to overpower whatever year cooking but somehow with the peas in the mint it's nice nice fresh flavor I need about a third of a cup of fresh mint leaves that should be bit right okay right into the soup new teaspoon salt little pepper might be a quarter of a teaspoon give it a little heat give it a stir and that's it pretty simple so if you put all of this soup into the blender and turn it on you're gonna be wearing it it's gonna be all over your kitchen so what I do is put one ladle of soup into the blender put the lid on let's put it on low and then take this little top part off and just slowly put the soup in [Music] and it with a few peas on the counter but you're not going to end up with soup all over you [Applause] smells great I can smell the peas and the mint and onions and leeks okay that's good and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna chill the soup and then let it run add some creme fraiche to a little richness it can serve it cold but when we heat it later so into the fridge and I'm gonna make a nice sandwich dip it with a soup so the next thing I'm gonna make is a roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich it's a really good sandwich I wanted to be really special for Joe so the first thing I do is roast some red peppers now usually peppers are roasted over an open flame so they char the outside but this is so much easier five hundred degrees into the oven for about thirty minutes and some be so delicious mix with a balsamic vinaigrette and capers and a goat cheese sandwich can't wait til lunch [Music] at least melt great red pepper and goat cheese sandwiches perfect when you want to make something really special you want to keep it really simple so what I've done is I've roasted these peppers for about 30 minutes I just want to cover them with foil and that way the steam is gonna get under the skins and that's gonna be really easy to peel off in the meantime we make it funny Greg I like to use a fruity olive oil but now that's something that's really strong 2 tablespoons 1 tablespoon of good bosonic vinegar 2 cloves of garlic right in the vinaigrette and then 2 tablespoons of drained capers perfect just whisk it all together and that's just a nice balsamic vinaigrette with capers okay now for the peppers see if these is steamed well they smell wonderful too I just let them cooling a little bit so I can take the peel off just make sure you discard the seeds in the stem and then just peel the peppers peel the skin off the peppers it's sort of bitter and it's a little tough so it's really much more pleasant to eat if the if it's peeled off okay next one and then just peel it off and the flesh of the pepper is just so delicious okay just toss them let the peppers marinate with a garlic and that's gonna be so good with the creamy goat cheese with herbs and the roasted red peppers I know it shows up to in that herb garden Wow Oh Joe my Gardens so beautiful thank you oh love it well you don't mind if I undo some of those herbs over there do I need lots of them makes them grow faster honey basil underneat chives time to make lunch [Music] all I have left to do now is eat up the soup make the sandwich and Joe and I are gonna have lunch so first I'm gonna do is I took a this is a cheap bottle which I really like I'm just gonna open this up and then just spread it on the bottom of the sandwich this is a girl looking herb goat cheese just cuz I like lots of flavor okay so that's the goat cheese one layer of nice roast peppers this is actually too many roast peppers for the sandwich but they're great for salads or antipas toes with capers in the garlic mmm I'll sell my vinaigrette little piece make sure you have one nice layer okay and then fresh basil leaves right on top I wouldn't want to have this for lunch okay the last piece of basil now I'm gonna do some red onion just very very thin slices okay just take the peel off the outside and just really sort of scatter them put the top on we're gonna cut this in quarters I'm not gonna smell the soup goat cheese and red peppers a great combination okay onto the tray let's see how the soup is doing now which is perfectly reheated just needs a little dollop of creme fraiche about a quarter of a cup and now some fresh chives right into the soup give it a stir this is like a study in green green peas green chives green leeks so that's gonna be great with a sandwich I need just a little extra dollop of creme fraiche a little snip of chives not bad lunch for cooking a gardener so you'd like the chives in the pea soup stores right from your garden perfect it seems you've owned them down there were charges in the garden hmm so can I do other herbs in the garden yeah absolutely um what else would you want I use rosemary I use thyme a lot good parsley great can I go to the garden center and get it sure good I never treat for you after you're done with that cuz you'll need a little strength I'm gonna make you a carrot and pineapple cake oh absolutely perfect [Music] what could be more appropriate dessert for a gardener than a carrot cake the first thing I need is a pound of grated carrots it's actually really important to do it on this kind of a box grater if you do it in a food processor the carrots get too wet and the cake will fall okay so that's a pound of carrots I'm gonna need about a half a cup of pineapple and instead of buying a whole pineapple for a half a cup I just bought some all cut up if you're gonna buy a fresh pineapple a golden pineapple is really really sweet okay that should be about a half a cup now for the batter first thing in these two cups of sugar - next I need one two third cups of vegetable oil this cake is good it doesn't use butter it uses oil 3 eggs I always break them into another container you never know when you're gonna get a bad egg and ruin everything you've already done okay that's three okay we'll turn this mixer on add the X she's pretty vanilla okay that's the wet ingredients now the dry ones I need two and a half cups of flour and put into the sieve because I always sieve the dry ingredients two teaspoons of cinnamon two teaspoons of baking soda 1 and a half teaspoons of salt I'm so stiff that together this just mixes it and make sure that if there any little things in the flour that you don't want your cake that's it on low speed just add the dry ingredients slowly you don't want the flour to clump in the cake remember this is the point you don't want to over mix it so the flour doesn't get tough perfect okay a cup of chopped walnuts one cup of raisins it's a really chunky party cake love it it's one of my favorites okay that goes in and then to make sure the raisins and walnuts don't sink to the bottom of the pan I'm gonna put in a tablespoon of flour and just toss them around that's a good trick whenever you have raisins nuts chocolate chips in a cake just flour them they won't sink to the bottom okay so I'm just gonna fold in the flour nuts and raisins just fold them in by hand you don't want to overmix the dough so and I'm gonna add the carrots and pineapple so it's 1 pound of carrots grated it's actually a great way to get carrots into your kids half a cup of chopped pineapple it's like old-fashioned carrots and pineapple and carrots and just fold those in it's a really thick batter it takes a little work to fold it in but it's worth it okay now we need two inch cake pans what I've done is I've buttered and floured the pants and I put parchment paper and it's really important to make sure that you can get the cake out once you've baked it so I'm gonna put half in each pan it's gonna be a two layer cake and later I'm gonna make delicious cream cheese frosting to put on it okay just smooth it out into the oven 350 degrees for about an hour which will give me just enough time to go the garden center to get some fresh herbs you can never have too many fresh herbs in the garden [Music] I love to use fresh herbs when I'm cooking I use rosemary a lot it's good for marinades and lamb and time I use it a lot anything Provence all with garlic and Parmesan love the way it smells and parsley the world's most underrated herb it's got great flavor these are little seedlings and they're gonna get huge I'll have lots of parsley this is flat leaf parsley and - curly parsley these are gonna get big - it's gonna be fantastic herb garden I have to get them back to Joe and then I'm gonna frost my carrot cake [Music] now for the best part of the carrot cake the frosting I'm gonna make a classic cream cheese frosting so I need 3/4 of a pound of cream cheese half a pound of butter I'm just gonna combine them don't whip them and once he sends vanilla and a pound of confectioner's sugar if you're worried about Levinson the confectioner sugar just said that before you put it in nobody needs lumpy icing okay I'm gonna go get the case [Music] and had good to those look carrot and pineapple cakes frostings done so it's very simple cream cheese butter vanilla confection sugar so I've got a serving plate I was like a nice flat plate like a cake stand and for a double layer cake I always turn it upside down so the flat layer is up in the middle and then in order to make sure that cake plate stays clean while I iced it just going to put little pieces of brushing paper around and then I'll pull the mat after I'm done icing it that way you don't end up with a cake that's gorgeous and a plate that's a mess okay that's that glass of icing so I'm just going to the middle first doesn't even have to go to the edge because when you put the second layer on it's gonna sort of smush it out to the edge that's a technical term smush okay now for the second layer the second layer I want rounded side up so it looks like a really old-fashioned cake and that way the two flat sides are together and it makes a better fit and now lots of icing on the outside you really want to do the sides first then the top so you want to just fold it right over the edge and what I'm gonna do is really apply it first and then go back and make sure it looks really beautiful cause you want the sides to be sort of straight I want to look like a snowball you want to look like a really nice cake start on the top but I fold it over to the sides and then we can fix it later I'm using what's called a pallet knife it's a really flexible spatula and it's great for icing okay now that's got a general layer of frosting and we do is with a clean knife I'm just gonna go I'm gonna make the sides straight by going over them just go up it down making the sides straight just do it really slowly and carefully and if you get crumbs in something just go over it now I'm gonna just repair the top make sure it's really pretty yeah just nice okay yeah then take parchment paper comes out and it doesn't take the icing with it excellent nice edge okay now I need a little decoration just something simple I think just look right around the edge somehow I don't want to put a carrot on top that doesn't look appealing but pineapple that works and that's it I'd say Joe and I have a really great treat he's been working hard in the garden and I've been working hard in the kitchen we deserve it [Music] you deserve a big piece of cake hmm that's terrific so those herbs at the garden center okay perfect and excellent choice but maybe in the spring we can take carrots I can make you more carrot cake wasn't coffee thank you very much Cheers thank you so much I love my garden it's amazing and that's it pretty simple so if you put all of this soup into the blender and turn it on you gonna be wearing it it's gonna be all over your kitchen so what I do is put one ladle of soup into the blender put the lid on let's put it on low and then take this little top part off and just slowly put the soup in [Music] they end up with a few peas on the counter but you're not going to end up with soup all over you [Applause] smells great I can smell the peas and the mint and onions and leeks okay that's good what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna chill the soup and then let it run add some creme fraiche to a little richness it can serve it cold probably heat it later so into the fridge and I'm gonna make a nice sandwich to go with the soup [Music] so the next thing we're gonna make is a roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich it's a really good sandwich I wanted to be really special for Joe so the first thing I do is we're going red peppers a great combination okay onto the tray let's see how the soup is doing now which is perfectly reheated just needs a little dollop of creme fraiche about a quarter of a cup and now some fresh chives right into the soup give it a stir this is like a Study in green green peas green chives green leeks so that's gonna be great with a sandwich maybe just a little extra dollop of creme fraiche a little snip of chives I bet lunch for cooking a gardener [Music] so you like the chives and the pea soup extortion right from your garden perfect did seem to mother down there were charges on the court mmm so can I do other rooms in the garden yeah absolutely um what else would you want I use rosemary I use thyme a lot go to parsley great can I go to the garden center and get it sure good I never treat for you after you're done with that what's your needle in this village and a pound of confectioner's sugar if you're worried about Levenson the confectioner sugar just said that before you put it in nobody needs lumpy icing okay I'm gonna book at the case [Music] and had good to those look carrot and pineapple cakes frostings done so it's very simple cream cheese butter vanilla confection sugar so I've got a serving plate I was like a nice flat plate like a cake stand and for a double layer cake I always turn it upside down so the flat layer is up in the middle and then in order to make sure that cake plate stays clean while I iced it just going to put a little pieces of parchment paper around and then I'll pull them out after I'm done icing it that way you don't end up with a cake that's gorgeous and a plate that's a mess okay that's that last of icing so I'm just gonna do the middle first doesn't even have to go to the edge because when you put the second layer on it's gonna sort of smush it out to the edge that's a technical term smush okay now for the second layer the second layer I want rounded side up so it looks like a really old-fashioned cake and that way the two flat sides are together and then two tablespoons of drained capers [Music] perfect just whisk it all together and that's just a nice balsamic vinaigrette with capers okay now for the peppers see if these is steamed well they smell wonderful too I just let them cool in a little bit so that I can take the peel off just make sure you discard the seeds in the stem and then just peel the peppers peel the skin off the peppers it's sort of bitter and it's a little tough so it's really much more pleasant to eat if the if it's peeled off okay next one and then just peel it off and the flesh of the pepper is just so delicious okay just toss them let the peppers marinate with a garlic and that's gonna be so good with the creamy goat cheese with herbs and the roasted red peppers can't wait I know it shows up too in that herb garden Wow Oh Joe my Gardens so beautiful thank you love it you're welcome you don't mind if I undo some of those herbs over there do you I need lots of them makes them grow faster honey basil underneat chives time to make lunch the second layer I want rounded side up so it looks like a really old-fashioned cake and that way the two flat sides are together and it makes a better fit and now lots of icing on the outside you really want to do the sides first then the top so you want to just fold it right over the edge and what I'm gonna do is really apply it first and then go back and make sure it looks really beautiful cuz you want the sides to be sort of straight and once you look at this snowball you want to look like a really nice cake start on the top but I fold it over to the sides and then we can fix it later I'm using what's called a pallet knife it's a really flexible spatula and it's great for icing okay now that's got a general layer of frosting and we did was with a clean knife I'm just gonna go I'm gonna make the sides straight by going over them just go up and down making the side strength just to really slowly and carefully and if you get crumbs in something just go over it now I'm gonna just repair the top make sure it's really pretty yeah just ice now capers and I go cheese sandwich can't wait til lunch [Music] at least no great red pepper and goat cheese sandwiches perfect when you want to make something really special you want to keep it really simple so what I've done is I've roasted these peppers for about 30 minutes I just want to cover them with foil and that way the steam is going to get under the skins and it's gonna be really easy to peel off in the meantime we make it funny gray I like to use a fruity olive opener that's something that's really strong 2 tablespoons 1 tablespoon of good balsamic vinegar [Music] two cloves of garlic right in the vinaigrette and then two tablespoons of drained capers perfect just whisk it all together and that's just a nice bus on the vinaigrette with capers okay now for the peppers see if these is steamed well they smell wonderful too I just let them cool in a little bit so that I can take the peel off just make sure you discard the seeds in the stem the roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich it's a really good sandwich I wanted to be really special for Joe so the first thing I do is roast some red peppers now usually peppers are roasted over an open flame so they char the outside but this is so much easier 500 degrees into the oven for about 30 minutes and it's gonna be so delicious mix of the balsamic vinaigrette and capers and a goat cheese sandwich can't wait till lunch [Music] at least melt great red pepper and goat cheese sandwiches perfect when you want to make something really special you want to keep it really simple so what I've done is I've roasted these peppers for about 30 minutes I just want to cover them with foil and that way the steam is going to get under the skins and it's gonna be really easy to peel off in the meantime we make it funny gray I like to use a fruity olive oil but now that's something that's really strong 2 tablespoons 1 tablespoon of good balsamic vinegar 2 cloves of garlic right in the vinaigrette and then 2 tablespoons of drained capers perfect just whisk it all together and that's just a nice balsamic vinaigrette with capers okay now for the peppers see if these is steamed well they smell wonderful too I just let them cool in a little bit so that I can take the peel off just make sure you discard the seeds in the stem and then just peel the peppers peel the skin off the peppers it's sort of bitter and it's a little tough so it's really much more pleasant to eat if it's peeled off okay next one and then just peel it off and the flesh of the pepper is just so delicious okay just toss them let the peppers marinate with a garlic and that's gonna be so good with the creamy goat cheese with herbs and the roasted red peppers I know it shows up to in that herb garden Wow Oh Joe my Gardens so beautiful thank you love it you don't mind if I undo some of those herbs over there do you I need lots of them makes them grow faster honey basil underneat chives time to make lunch [Music] all I have left to do now is eat up the soup make the sandwich and Joe and I are gonna have lunch so first I'm gonna do is I took a this is a cheap bottle which I really like I'm just gonna open this up and then just spread it on the bottom of the sandwich this is a garlic and herb goat cheese just cuz I like lots of flavor okay so that's the goat cheese one layer of nice roast peppers this is actually too many roast peppers for the sandwich but they're great for salads or anta pastas with capers in the garlic mmm I'll sound like vinaigrette one little piece make sure you have one nice layer okay and then fresh basil leaves right on top I wouldn't want to have this for lunch okay the last piece of basil now I'm gonna do some red onion just very very thin slices we can't just take the peel off the outside and just really sort of scatter them put the top on I got cut this in quarters mm I can smell the soup goat cheese and red peppers a great combination okay onto the tray let's see how the soup is doing now which is perfectly reheated just needs a little dollop of creme fraiche about a quarter of a cup and now some fresh chives right into the soup give it a stir this is like a study in green green peas green chives green leeks so that's gonna be great with a sandwich I need just a little extra dollop of creme fraiche a little snip of chives [Music] my friend Joe Tyree designed my new garden so in return I've decided to make him lunch while he plants the walled herb garden I'm making him a delicious fresh green pea soup and serving it with a dollop of creme fraiche then we'll have roasted pepper and goat cheese sandwiches with basil from the garden and when its work is done we'll have a big slice of carrot and pineapple cake to celebrate so I thought maybe soup a sandwich a nice cake for dessert that'd be nice so I'm gonna make fresh pea soup and I'm gonna start the soup with one leek so I've just used the like green parts and white parts and then think about leeks as they're really good but they have a lot of dirt in them so you want to be sure that they're really well clean I'm cutting them in quarters and then you can see the dirt inside so I'm just gonna wash them really well just do this really carefully make sure you get all the sand dappin between the leaves to the smallest amount can ruin the most delicious soup okay that should be good so I'm just gonna chop these up roughly the soups pureed so there's really no need to make it perfectly chopped just big rough chop okay so into the pot just about a tablespoon of butter one cup of chopped leeks okay so the next thing I'm going to do is I need a half a cup of onion leeks have a very mild flavor and onions have a little more strength so it gives it a little more complex flavor yeah okay simple onion chopping keep your fingers out of the way and this way if you leave the root intact the whole onion stays together it's much easier than it's scrambling across the board okay into the pan with the butter on the leeks big spoon give it a stir so these are gonna cook for about that ten minutes until the onions and the leeks are really tender sort of translucent it's actually a great day cuz Joe gets to garden I get to cook we all get to do exactly what we want to do and then we have a good lunch any chicken stock I like to make my own and peas so the first thing I'm going to do is put in two cups of chicken stock I really like to use homemade chicken stock but if you don't have it use a can when I'm just cooking away in the kitchen I just throw some chicken and vegetables into a big pot let it boil away for four hours and a really good chicken stock and peas this is the key I actually use frozen peas because I think they're better in this fresh peas by the time they get to market they're a little sort of starchy you use ten ounces of frozen peas so I'm just going to let this cook for about three minutes remember they're blanch before they're put in the package so they're already pretty cooked [Music] it's actually a really specific flavor I don't use it very much because it tends to overpower whatever you cooking but somehow with the peas in the mint it's nice nice fresh flavor I need about a third of a cup of fresh mint leaves that should be bit right okay right into the soup neat teaspoon salt little pepper maybe a quarter of a teaspoon give it a little heat give it a stir and that's it pretty simple so if you put all this soup into the blender and turn it on you're gonna be wearing it it's gonna be all over your kitchen so what I do is put one ladle of soup into the blender put the lid on let's put it on low and then take this little top part off and just slowly put the soup in [Music] they end up with a few peas on the counter but you're not going to end up with soup all over you [Applause] smells great I can smell the peas and the mint and the onions and leeks okay that's good now what I'm going to do is I'm going to chill the soup and then let it run add some creme fraiche to a little richness you can serve it cold probably heat it later so into the fridge and I'm gonna make a nice sandwich dip it with a soup [Music] so the next thing I wanted to make is a bad lunch for cooking a gardener so [Music] you'd like the chives in the pea soup stores right from your garden perfect I just seem to have owned them down oh there were charges in the garden hmm so can I do other herbs in the garden yeah absolutely um what else would you want honey is rosemary I use thyme a lot good parsley great can I go to the garden center and get it sure good never treat for you after you're done with that cuz you'll need a little strength I'm gonna make you a carrot and pineapple cake oh absolutely perfect [Music] what could be more appropriate dessert for a gardener than a carrot cake the first thing is a pound of grated carrots it's actually really important to do it on this kind of a box grater if you do it in a food processor the carrots get too wet and the cake will fall okay so that's a pound of carrots I'm going to need about a half a cup of pineapple and instead of buying a whole pineapple for a half a cup I just bought some all cut up if you're gonna buy a fresh pineapple a golden pineapple is really really sweet okay that should be about a half a cup now for the batter first thing gonna use two cups of sugar - next I need one 2/3 cups of vegetable oil this cake is good it doesn't use butter is as oil 3 eggs I always break them into another container you never know when you're gonna get a bad egg and ruin everything you've already done okay that's three okay I'll turn this mixer on add the X she's gonna Genoa you okay that's the wet ingredients now the dry ones I need two and a half cups of flour and put it in a sieve because I always sieve the dry ingredients two teaspoons of cinnamon two teaspoons of baking soda one and a half teaspoons of salt just sift all that together this just mixes it and make sure that there any little things in the flour that you don't want your cake that's it on low speed just add the dry ingredients slowly you don't want the flour to clump in the cake remember this is the point you don't want to over mix it so the flour doesn't get tough perfect okay a cup of chopped walnuts one cup of raisins it's a really chunky hearty cake look one of my favorites okay that goes in and then to make sure the raisins and walnuts don't sink to the bottom of the pan I'm gonna put in a tablespoon of flour and just toss them around that's a good trick whenever you have raisins nuts chocolate chips in a cake just flour them they won't sink to the bottom okay so I'm just gonna fold in the flour nuts and raisins just fold them in by hand you don't want to over mix the dough so and I'm gonna add the carrots and pineapple so it's 1 pound of carrots grated it's actually a great way to get carrots into your kids half a cup of chopped pineapple that's like old-fashioned carrots and pineapple and carrots and just fold those in it's a really thick batter it takes a little work to fold it in but it's worth it ok now we need two 8-inch cake pans what I've done is I've buttered and floured the pants and I put parchment paper and it's really important to make sure that you can get the cake out once you've baked it so I'm gonna put half in each pan it's gonna be a two layer cake and later I'm gonna make delicious cream cheese frosting to put on it okay just smooth it out into the oven 350 degrees for about an hour which will give me just enough time to go the garden center to get some fresh herbs you can never have too many fresh herbs in the garden [Music] I love to use fresh herbs when I'm cooking I use rosemary a lot it's good for marinades and lamb let's put it on low and then take this little top part off and just slowly put the soup in [Music] they end up with a few peas on the counter but you're not going to end up with soup all over you [Applause] smells great I can smell the peas and the mint and onions and leeks okay that's good I want I'm going to do is I'm gonna chill the soup and then let it run add some creme fraiche to a little richness it can serve it cold lemon we heat it later so into the fridge and I'm gonna make a nice sandwich to go with the soup [Music] so the next thing I'm gonna make is a roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich it's a really good sandwich I wanted to be really special for Joe so the first thing I do is rip goat cheese and red peppers a great combination okay onto the tray let's see how the soup is doing now which is perfectly reheated just needs a little dollop of creme fraiche about a quarter of a cup and now some fresh chives right into the soup give it a stir this is like a Study in green green peas green chives green leeks so that's gonna be great with a sandwich I need just a little extra dollop creme fraiche a little snip of chives not a bad lunch for cooking a gardener [Music] so you like the chives in the pea soup store so right from your garden perfect did seem to moan them down there were challenges in the garden hmm so could I do whether it hurts in the garden yeah absolutely uh what else would you want I use rosemary I use thyme a lot good parsley great can I go to the garden center and get it sure good I never treat for you after you're done with that that's your needle in the village and a pound of confectioner's sugar if you worried about Levinson the confectioner sugar just sieve it before you put it in nobody needs lumpy icing okay I'm gonna book at the case [Music] and had good to those look carrot and pineapple cakes frostings done so it's very simple cream cheese butter vanilla confection sugar so I've got a serving plate I was like a nice flat plate like a cake stand and for a double layer cake I always turn it upside down so the flat layers up in the middle and then in order to make sure that cake plate stays clean while I iced it just going to put little pieces of parchment paper around and then I'll pull them out after I'm done icing it that way you don't end up with a cake that's gorgeous and a plate that's a mess okay that's that last of icing so I'm just going to the middle first doesn't even have to go to the edge because when you put the second layer on its own sort of smush it out to the edge that's a technical term smush okay now for the second layer the second layer I want rounded side up so it looks like a really old-fashioned cake and that way the two flat sides are together and then two tablespoons of drained capers [Music] perfect just whisk it all together and that's just a nice balsamic vinaigrette with capers okay now for the peppers see if these esteemed well they smell wonderful too I just let them cool a little bit so I can take the peel off just make sure you discard the seeds in the stem and then just peel the peppers peel the skin off the peppers it's sort of bitter and it's a little tough so it's really much more pleasant to eat if the if it's peeled off okay next one and then just peel it off and the flesh of the pepper is just so delicious okay just toss them let the peppers marinate with a garlic and that's gonna be so good with the creamy goat cheese with herbs and the roasted red peppers can't wait I know it shows up to in that herb garden Wow Oh Joe my Gardens so beautiful thank you and time I use it a lot anything Provence saw with garlic and Parmesan love the way it smells and parsley the world's most underrated herb it's got great flavor these are little seedlings and they're gonna get huge so I have lots of parsley this is flat leaf parsley and two curly parsley these are gonna get big - it's gonna be fantastic herb garden I have to get them back to Joe and then I'm gonna frost my carrot cake you [Music] now for the best part of the carrot cake the frosting I'm gonna make a classic cream-cheese frosting so I need 3/4 of a pound of cream cheese half a pound of butter I'm just gonna combine them don't whip them and once he spends the night and a pound of confectioner's sugar if you're worried about Levinson the confectioner sugar just save it before you put it in nobody needs lumpy icing okay I'm gonna go get the case [Music] and had good to those look carrot and pineapple cakes frostings done so it's very simple cream cheese butter vanilla confection sugar so I've got a serving plate I was like a nice flat plate like a cake stand and for a double layer cake I always turn it upside down so the flat layer is up in the middle and then in order to make sure that cake plate stays clean while I iced it just going to put little pieces of parchment paper around and then I'll pull them out after I'm done icing it that way you don't end up with a cake that's gorgeous and a plate that's a mess okay that's that blast of icing so just gonna do the middle first doesn't even have to go to the edge because when you put the second layer on its go and sort of smush it out to the edge that's a technical term smush okay now for the second layer the second layer I want rounded side up so it looks like a really old-fashioned cake and that way the two flat sides are together and it makes a better fit and now lots of icing on the outside you really want to do the sides first and then the top so you want to just fold it right over the edge and what I'm gonna do is really apply it first and then go back and make sure it looks really beautiful cuz you want the sides to be sort of straight don't want to look like a snowball you want to look like a really nice cake start on the top but I fold it over to the sides and then we can fix it later I'm using what's called a pallet knife it's a really flexible spatula and it's great for icing okay now that's got a general layer of frosting and we do is with a clean knife I'm just gonna go I'm gonna make the sides straight by going over them just go cut it down making the sides straight just really slowly and carefully and if you get crumbs in something just go over it now I'm going to just prepare the top make sure it's really pretty yeah just eyes okay yeah I'm gonna take parchment paper comes out and it doesn't take the icing with it excellent nice edge okay now I need a little decoration just something simple I think just like right around the edge somehow I don't want the carrot on top that doesn't look appealing but pineapple that works that's it I'd say Joe and I have a really great treat he's been working hard in the garden and I've been working hard in the kitchen we deserve it [Music] you deserve a big piece of cake hmm that's terrific so those herbs at the garden center okay perfect an excellent choice but maybe in the spring we can plant carrots I can make you more carrot cake wasn't coffee thank you very much Cheers thank you so much I love my garden it's amazing and that's it pretty simple so if you put all of this soup into the blender and turn it on you're gonna be wearing it it's gonna be all over your kitchen so what I do is put one ladle of soup into the blender put the lid on
[Music] it's such a gorgeous day my friends are here for the weekend I'm gonna pack a picnic and we're all going to the town [Music] my picnic by the pond I'm gonna make grilled salmon sandwiches old-fashioned carrot salad and for dessert lemon bars this is really the carrot salad that my mother used to make when I was a kid it's very old fashioned but I'm gonna make it faster the food processor I like to grate the carrots you'll see how fast it is that's pretty fast and I put them inside way so you get really long shreds rather than if you stand them up you get short shreds I think it looks so much nicer that's it two bunches of chopped carrots I think the top carrots are actually sweeter than the ones in the bag so that's really good okay and then I'm just gonna add lots of old-fashioned ingredients a cup of mayonnaise cup of pineapple this is actually golden pineapple just so much sweeter than regular kind of all just delicious tastes like it was just picked got a cup of races isn't this old-fashioned salt and pepper mix it all together you can really do any combination you if you want more raisins less raisins more pineapple do it the way you like it but not too much mayonnaise you just want to moisturize I'm also making buffalo chicken wings with blue cheese dressing mmm so good and Caesar salad with pancetta how's that for a picnic by the pond and do something I think I'll be really pretty is I'm gonna take a pepper half cut this in half and use that as the bowl for the carrot salad so it'll be really colorful too and then we can eat the balls that's got to be really good I [Music] love Caesar salad it's great on its own but it's also great with additions like grilled lemon chicken but today I'm gonna make it with pancetta and roasted cherry tomatoes it's really good foundation so two plates of cherry tomatoes a little olive oil salt and pepper I'm just gonna roll them around gonna roast these at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes until they're really juicy and tender into the oven really messy too then I'm gonna add Italian bacon which is called pancetta and that's the Italian store to cut it very thick it's really about a half an inch thick and then I'm gonna dice it it's really like adding bacon to a Caesar salad which is great but it has much more flavor I think but if you can't find pancetta just use bacon this is gonna cook on the stove for about 15 minutes until a lot of the fat comes out and you're just left with really delicious bacon okay into the pan [Music] break it up a little bit and cook it over medium heat okay that's the pancetta now I'm gonna make the dressing one egg yolk two cloves of garlic chopped up two teaspoons of mustard that's so much flavor anchovies I know you think they're hairy fish they're really good and Caesar salad dressing you can leave them out if you want to but I think they're really important so maybe six or eight anchovies half a cup of lemon juice fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons of kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper Tapan and puree this and while it's on like making mayonnaise I'm gonna pour one and a half cups of olive oil in Gordon slowly and it gets very thick just like mayonnaise [Music] then the last thing is half a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and that's the dressing its tasted to make sure it's perfect it's delicious Parmesan and little anchovy flavor it's really important okay so next for the salad greens so I have two heads of romaine lettuce just slice it across remains great for this because it really stays firm when you put the dressing on it it won't wilt okay into the bowl so I'm gonna combine the lettuce and the pancetta and the tomatoes and then later just before I'm gonna pack it up for the picnic I'm gonna pour the dressing on so let's see how that tomatoes are doing these look great they're really tender and they're still firm right onto the top of the lettuce right and then the pancetta I'm just gonna drain make sure they're not too oily [Music] just trying it for a second you wanted to be crisp not soggy edit on top now I'm just gonna pack up the dressing and we'll be ready to combine later for my party that was pretty easy [Music] I'm looking for disposable tableware for my picnic because who wants to drag all those dishes to the pond see I've got grilled salmon sandwiches grated carrots out this would look great dark blue I think they look fabulous on that I'd be a little bit of a print for the lemon bars and I love these striped napkins all I need is cutlery all these large white knives and forks would be great it's Continental sighs everyone's gonna have their own bag so all I need is the bags now simple is always better isn't it [Music] my picnic by the pond I'm making all kinds of portable food including lemon bars for dessert so I'm gonna start with two sticks of butter 1/2 a cup of sugar why do all my recipes start with two sticks of butter it's for a party though I'm just gonna cream those together and then with the mixer on low add 2 cups of flour and Nathan teach themself great this is really a shortbread dough it's so much easier to make it doesn't require a rolling pin I'm just gonna Pat it right into the pan okay put it right into a 9 by 12 pan don't even have to grease the pan coz there's butter on the dough I'm just gonna fly with my hands and press this out I mean chill it for about 15 minutes and then later on it wouldn't make a wonderful lemon curd filling and pour it on top of the baked dough and then cut them out in squares for my party okay just chill for 15 minutes good so the first thing I want to do is make a sauce it's a fresh green herb sauce 1 cup of mayonnaise 1/4 of a cup of sour cream and then I always like to thin it with a little bit of flavoring so a little white wine vinegar will do it so it's not so thick and lots of fresh green herbs of basil leaves mmm the smell of basil and lots of fresh dill I'm just gonna run my knife along the edge take off some fronds just a good dressing for the salmon sandwiches but it's also a good dip for vegetables it's a really fresh great tasting dip so big handful of fresh dill and some chopped scallions not too much because you don't want the flavor of the scallions to overwhelm the salmon so just enough to give it a little spice salt and pepper and because I like a little vinegary thing with it with the salmon it's nice maybe about a tablespoon of capers goes right in okay and then just puree it all together that's the sauce I'm just gonna put the sandwiches together so I've got brioche rolls cut them in half just gonna put a little bit of sauce on both sides just make sure that bread stays moist and then I either put basil leaves or sometimes some mescaline which is this wonderful fresh salad mixed greens and a nice piece of salmon I've actually grilled this for about five minutes on each side just going to take the skin off and took it off before it was entirely cooked and then covered it with foil and it actually continues to cook and that's how it stays incredibly moist and that's the cemetery and then to the fridge my call for picnic is easy cleanup everybody's gonna have everything they need in one bag and it's all disposable we have plastic wine glass breaking plates disposable silverware large-size gorgeous blue napkin and everything has to match even though it's a picnic it has to be gorgeous so when the food's ready everybody's gonna have all their food everything they need for the picnic right in the bag and since the Swans have to eat to bread for everybody in their bag and the one thing that's not disposable I don't want to forget the corkscrew [Music] so I've chilled the dough for my lemon bars and now I'm gonna bake them 350 for about 15 minutes and later I'm gonna make the filling my picnic by the pond I'm making lots of portable food including lemon bars for dessert I've got the crust all baked and cooled and now I'm making the filling so I've got 6 eggs 3 cups of sugar I'm just gonna whisk it all together these are really lemony lemon bars I've got lots of lemon juice and lots of zest and them a great flavor okay next thing is 2 tablespoons of grated lemon zest which I've already got right there a cup of fresh lemon juice you can already smell the sharpness of the citrusy lemon and the last thing is 1 cup of flour just put the flour in slowly so it doesn't get lumpy and when this is done I'm going to pour it onto the crust put it in the oven 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes until it sets and when they're cool I'm going to cut them in big squares and definitely confectioner sugar it's gonna be so good with my picnic of the pond okay just pour it right in that's dessert but first we need a main course and I thought with the Caesar salad and pancetta be great to have buffalo chicken wings with blue cheese dip take off the wing tip and then cut the rest of it in half so the wing tip is really not used I reserved it for chicken stock and then these two pieces I'm gonna make buffalo chicken wings out of so onto my sheet pan usually a buffalo chicken wings are fried but I hate dealing with a big pot of boiling oil never mind how dangerous it is so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna brush these with really spicy butter and then broil them and I think they're just delicious so give the spicy butter I've got four tablespoons of butter melted I'm going to add two teaspoons of fat sauce it's really hot one teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper even hotter but remember we're just brushing it on I'm just gonna mix it together and brush on the chicken wings so I'm serving really spicy chicken wings with a really cool blue cheese dressing as a dip and as always traditionally served with celery which is sort of cool and crunchy it's such a great combination and since it's finger food it's great for a picnic with lots of napkins so I'm gonna borrow these for eight minutes and I'm going to turn them brush them with more spicy butter and broil them for another four and they'll be delicious great and while that's happening I'm gonna make the blue cheese dip so I need three quarters of a cup of gorgonzola crumbled right into the food processor okay have a cup of mayonnaise half a cup of sour cream just a splash of milk to thin it a little bit some Worcestershire sauce some salt and pepper and just puree it up [Applause] this is a great tip not just for buffalo chicken minds but also for fresh vegetables no it's wonderful great blue cheese flavor and the Worcestershire sauce does a lot for it and I think the buffalo chicken wings are ready how good do those look I'm just gonna turn these and brush them again with its spicy butter and four more minutes in the oven they'll be done countdown to the picnic all I have to do is pack everything up so first thing is carrot salad I'm gonna do a little container for the carrot salad and a pepper it's the own little edible ball I take the seeds out and just as my fingers take the rib out and watch this a little bit of carrot salad in the red pepper great colors delicious into a Chinese takeout container [Music] okay the next thing is our grilled salmon sandwich with mescal and herb dressing just wrap it up in parchment paper so you two salad with pancetta and roasted tomatoes I'm just gonna put the dressing on also good I think a little extra Parmesan cheese just right it's the container okay the next one is buffalo chicken wings I think what I'm going to do put a little bit of a blue cheese bit in the bottom of the container and then put two buffalo wings and some celery sticks right on top and then it has its own little bit and the last thing is to serve lemon bars I'm just go Dustin with a little bit of powdered sugar this is so lemony I can't wait for dessert and I've just I've cut 12 of them in this pan so the first one that's hard to get out okay I'll wrap it in parchment paper [Music] [Music] off to the pond to me my friends [Music] you [Music]
I've got the Apple they look gorgeous in the farm and now we're just going to make minecraft I don't know why but I think people find pie crust more daunting than anything else that we make I'm going to show you the secret of really good pie crust and it's about very cold ingredients I'm going to start with three cups of flour just regular all-purpose flour sugar 1 teaspoon song a song for the shortening so all kinds of debate that will kind of shortened into use for pie crust but I actually combine vegetable shortening and I do it very cold to consider the refrigerator and butter and then you get all of the flakiness of a vegetable shortening and all the flavor of the butter the third of a cup of vegetable shortening I have one and a half sticks of cold butter that I've diced and I actually put it back in the refrigerator until I was ready so it's really cold put that right in and that comes the critical part what you want in the dough is little bits of butter and shortening through the dough you don't want to totally pureed and that's what makes it so a key when the heat from the oven hits the butter it causes steam to evaporate and that's what makes it really flaky so when you're doing this make sure it's not totally pureed in the flash I'm just going to pulse this about 8 times until it's like the size of peas maybe 10 times so you can still see bits of butter and shortening in the flour and that's what's going to make really flaky pastry I'm going to do maybe one more second ok so the next thing is ice water and I needed that a table to win such as about 1/2 a cup for as the ice so I'm going to turn this on and just let it go right until it forms a ball okay we're there so now we're going to refrigerate it for about 30 minutes it's a really important part of making good pie pastry okay now for the filling teach - apple pie four pounds of apples cut up in big chunks and I'm going to flavor it with a little bit of orange zest and lemon zest one tablespoon of orange juice and two tablespoons of lemon juice this not only flavors it but it keeps the applicant going Brown 1/2 a cup of sugar it all depends on how sweet the apples are these are pretty tart quarter cup flour and teaspoon of salt okay now for the spices three careers of the teas for the good cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of good nutmeg love the way it smells smells like apple pie spices already okay eighth of a teaspoon of allspice just really a pinch then just gonna mix it all up and then right into the crust it's a lot of apples for this tigress but I like it when it's piled high mile-high apple pie okay now for the top crust thirty Philip I roll it up on the rolling pin and lit really gently over this there's so many different ways to crimp a pie I think everybody wants to do with the way their mother did it but what I like to do is just roll the top crust underneath the bottom one I want to make this a really old-fashioned looking okay once that's done you can either to crimp it with a fork crimping is about keeping the two crests together so it seals in the juices or you can do it with your fingers I think I'll do it with my fingers okay crimped now I'm going to do an egg wash going to make the crust really nice and brown which is one egg beaten with about a tablespoon of water or milk or whatever you have just brush the whole top okay a little bit of sugar make it nice and shiny and then just a few holes in the top to let the steam escape so the crust is sentient this sort of old-fashioned okay into the oven 400 degrees for about an hour an hour and 15 minutes now that's an apple pie my favorite part is at least the house smells fabulous
[Music] my husband Jeffrey worked really far from East Hampton and when he comes home on Friday night I like everything to be really special I usually make him roast chicken but tonight I'm gonna surprise him with a tex-mex dinner and has tequila lime chicken it's really good but hey it's still chicken I feel really strongly about guacamole I know you don't hear that a lot but I just think usually it's a puree of avocados that doesn't have a lot of flavor and I just think it's got to have lots of flavor and be really chunky this is how you take the pit out of the avocado just like that plunk well if guacamole to start then the chicken some corn pudding and a delicious key lime pie for dessert these are perfectly ripe I want them so that they're bright green and they're ripe enough so they come out of the show really easily if they're too ripe you'll find they're really Brown these are just perfect it's a green around the outside and yellow in the middle he's gonna be so good when Jeffrey gets home with chips and margaritas while the tequila lime chicken cooks gotta have something special when he walks in the door okay one more half see when they're ripe it comes out really easily it's beautiful okay now with a season know people ask me all the time what's the best way to keep the guacamole green and there's really one key ingredient lemon juice they're all these theories about having the seed in it forget it it's really about fresh lemon juice and it's got to be freshly squeezed lemon juice okay got that and then all kinds of delicious things to season it with hot sauce I like when it's really spicy you can decide how hot you want yours I like garlic in it so chopped garlic red onions it's gonna be so good lots of salt and freshly ground peper and this is the secret to really good guacamole I don't puree it all I do is cut into it just like this so it's a really chunky it mixes the ingredients together and it stays really chunky this way just run your knife through the avocados okay just mix it up and make sure the flavors are well good and the last thing is tomato so I've chopped tomatoes I take the seeds out I put the tomatoes in last cuz I don't want it to color the guacamole just toss it lightly I'm sure it needs more salt we want to cook the right balance of avocado lemon juice salt and pepper little salt that's pretty good I think Jeffrey's gonna love it with corn chips yellow corn chips blue corn chips or you can even get red corn chips how crazy is that that's gonna be really good I'm going shopping I just need a few more ingredients I need some tequila for my Tex Mex barbecue but who knew there were so many kinds all right Tom I need your help okay well so I know I'm gonna get this for the tequila lime chicken oh so I wish you well what I'm gonna get for margaritas this house is an excellent choice for motor Easter why don't I start with that how's that okay thank you so much oh that's just great and now I need a jalapeno pepper for my tequila lime chicken this is what gives my chicken attitude when I think of tex-mex I always think of lime so I thought wouldn't it be fun to make Jeffrey's favorite frozen key lime pie for dessert so say how easy it is and we have to start with a graham cracker crust that's the fun part and I'm just gonna puree them in the food processor [Music] that's it so it's about nine or ten graham crackers depending on how many are in the package sort of a cup of sugar and 3/4 of a stick of butter I know it's more butter but it's really good all you have to do is mix the butter and the sugar and the graham crackers and then press it into the pan no key limes are those tiny little limes that you can find in Florida but they're so hard to find anywhere else that I just make this with regular limes it's really good so this goes into the pie pan 9-inch pie pan press it in no rolling pins even the kids can do this oh just a form it like this lightly maybe nice little edge I'll show you a little trick about how to make the corners really crisp is take the measuring cup and just run it along the edge [Music] how easy is that 350 degrees for ten minutes and it would be ready for the filling I think one of the hardest things about entertaining is trying to figure out a menu I just try and balance flavors against each other so I thought with the spiciness of the tequila lime chicken be really nice to have creamy Sagaponack corn pudding so what I've done is saute about five cups of corn kernels I just cut them off the cob with a cup of onions I'm gonna cook this for about four minutes until the starchiness and the corn has gone and now I'm gonna make the custard for the pudding it's really a traditional custard with eggs and milk or a little cream and some lots of added flavor for eggs I have a cup of half-and-half and a cup of milk gonna whisk this all together in a second to give it lots of corn flavor half a cup of stone-ground yellow cornmeal I'm gonna whisk that all together this recipe is actually inspired by a corn pudding that a friend of mine on a pump makes at her store loaves &amp; Fishes which is in Sagaponack has similar ingredients and lots of flavor I'm gonna add a cup of ricotta which gives it really good body tablespoon of sugar just to give it a little sweetness tablespoon of salt so it tastes good three-quarters of a tablespoon of freshly ground pepper and then the two West ingredients are cheddar and basil I'm gonna grate some cheddar this is really important to have really good cheddar pick something that's that's a sharp on it or extra sharp something like that half of this is going to go in the pudding and half of its gonna go on the top to make sure it gets nice and brown so good okay and the last things fresh basil love corn and basil together so I'm just gonna take some basil and just chop it up really roughly it doesn't have to be perfect okay that's it right in and I'm just gonna whisk this whole thing together so this is the pudding and I'm just gonna add the sauteed corn and onion this will be thick and delicious so you want this to have cooled a little bit so it doesn't cook the eggs immediately so that's just the way it is and that's it into the dish a sprinkling of cheese to make sure it gets nice and brown into the oven 375 for 40 to 45 minutes in the water bath so it bakes evenly [Music] and it's gonna come out all puffed and golden brown yeah [Music] so next to the key lime pie this is my kind of cooking no cooking at all I've whipped six egg yolks in the mixer with about a quarter of a cup of sugar and now I'm going to add sweetened condensed milk this is a really traditional recipe but I think this has more flavor than most yeah and a fish that lid out so I'm going to pour it in on low speed just so it mixes in make sure you get it all I even got it on the mixer that's nice the next thing is lime zest I always use lime juice but I think the zest has more flavor than the juice so I make sure that I get a lot in this is my handy dandy rasp I love it so that's about two tablespoons of lime zest just goes right in and the last ingredient is freshly squeezed lime juice it's about 3/4 of a cup oh this looks so great you can see all the zest and the filling and that's it I'm just gonna pour it into my big pie shell remember I bake the graham cracker crust for about 10 minutes so it's just a little firm make sure it's really well mixed into the freezer I'll decorate it later with whipped cream oh just the time hi sweetie you're early I got the keyline pipe then just in time I spent many years making welcome Oh spectacular I'm so glad you like it so I think the grills ready okay I get the chicken okay tequila lime chicken it's like Geoffrey's favorite Friday night roast chicken but with the volume turned up what I'm doing is I'm gonna make a marinade for the boneless chicken breasts and it's gonna make them taste so fabulous so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of tequila always helps and the next is freshly squeezed lime it's really important none of that bottled stuff you really do need freshly squeezed lime juice it makes all the difference in the world so 1 cup of freshly squeezed lime juice that actually also tenderizes the chicken half a cup of orange juice to give it a little sweetness chili powder to give it heat 1 tablespoon if you want more heat you can use more chili powder that's also good tablespoon of chopped garlic give it spice and this is the key ingredient jalapeno pepper it's really hot I'm going to show you how this works so slice right in the middle and what's really hot is the seeds so I'm just going to take the seeds out and while you're working on this pepper be sure that you don't touch anything you really care about before you wash your hands because it's incredibly hot don't rub your eye what I'm gonna do is just chop this finely I like the tequila lime chicken to have a little bit of heat but I don't want to have third-degree burns when we're done so that goes right in would be so good two teaspoons of salt teaspoon of ground black pepper and then the license chicken so I've got six boneless chicken breasts I actually like them to the skin on us think they stay moister so I asked the butcher to take the bone off but leave the skin on and I'm just gonna put them in the marinade the great thing about this is not only is it good to leave it overnight but it's actually the more it sits in the marinade the better it tastes so it's a wonderful thing to do for entertaining so that's tequila lime chicken it's gonna be so good on the grill [Music] hey there goes I just want to decorate my Cuban palette so I think with whipped cream and lies it's gonna be wonderful about a cup of heavy cream wearing part of it quarter of a cup of sugar and some vanilla while that's going I'm just gonna slice up some lines I just think it's really important for something to be decorated with a flavor that it is so when you look at it you know exactly that it's lime you want it so it's really firm but not but it hasn't turned into butter yet so that's perfect and sometimes we're not feeling up to it I'll piped in a decorative way but I think now it's gonna be really casual Americans right in the middle just so you can see the frozen key lime pie around the edges but you have the whipped cream in the middle just like that it's easy it's earthy and then with some fresh lime and that's it doesn't that look great and it can sit in the freezer for a really long time but we're gonna have it tonight and then we're better go see what Geoffrey's up to with a barbecue so don't have to call the fire department fire department look at this is a great this is a will a few extra matches there's a whole box in that world all right I'm gonna go finish dinner okay and I leave you here on your own [Music] okay that's your one and only grill let me do that okay just over the top of my girl you're doing a great job okay one chicken going on you want to do the next one make sure okay okay have him keep it keep his brother comfort okay wanna get the salt and pepper yeah okay and a little bit on top on top a little more are you you think you're cooking over here are you doing now you promised me this is gonna be as good as my roast chicken I don't know I think it might be better all right so I'm gonna go set the table are you in charge of the chicken I'm in charge the chicken what do I do I turn it over every once in a while no wait until it's cooked on one side for about 10 minutes and then you turn it over so I wait ten minutes yeah okay okay even though it's dinner just for Jeffrey and me I wanted to be really special or make sure he always wants to come home on Friday night I always look for something in the meal that inspires me for the table and since it's tex-mex I thought limes why not margaritas tequila lime chicken so a big ball of limes is the beginning and I thought tex-mex hot colors I thought orange these are gerber daisies they're great and of course the lime green of the clock really picks up the the center's and the stems and the limes so that's good Sagaponack corn pudding it's gonna be so good with the tequila lime chicken very pleased and very surprised and my virtuosity here looks great good for you I hope that's not the high point it's acute of lime chicken on one little line line I'll have some of that point putting a little Sagaponack corn pudding maybe a little so some watercress to go on your plate it's a little spice you'll never be too spicy corn putting it back is it good oh good is it is the corn a little crunchy like I like it it's crunchy and what else is in here well has basil and cheddar in it there's a little punch all of this that's good so what do you think of the chicken chicken is sensational well good news to our combined effort ready for key lime pie sweetie I sure AM great keeping with the tex-mex theme I will have had lots of lime right well I'll tell you what I'm not tired of it yet no good this is good just wonderful really superb good how many have you been making probably 35 well I have to tell you this is the best one yeah thank you sweetie [Music]
[Music] my friends are coming over and I said I was going to make a Mexican themed meal so I thought with the Mexican chicken soup it'd be great to have jalapeno cheddar cornbread I'm going to start with the dry ingredients first they need 3 cups of flour all-purpose flour 1 cup of cornmeal I use medium we have a choice of a medium grind or a fine grind I use medium grind one cup of yellow cornmeal a little bit of sweetness quarter of a cup of sugar 2 tablespoons of baking powder 2 teaspoons of salt really important ingredient to make sure got enough salt in it to bring out the flavors and stir those together now we're going to put together the wet ingredients so the first thing I need is two sticks of butter can't make cornbread with that good butter it's a half a pound it's going to melt that in the meantime I need three eggs I'd say most cornbread is really dry but this is very moist lots of flavor took up the milk okay and the melted butter I'm going to whisk it in make sure the eggs are broken up pour this into the middle of the dry ingredients make a big well in the middle pour it in and just start you don't want to over mix it it'll get tough so just stir it in just as much as you need to in order to make it really moist okay so that's eight ounces of cheddar I'll put it all in just leave a little bit for the topping and I need 1/3 of a cup of chopped scallions just roughly chopped okay that should be about a third and now the jalapeno is a hot part if some recipes say like a large jalapeno I don't know what a large jalapeno is but this would be as hot or as mild as you like okay right into the batter so with the cheddar scallions and jalapeno and only tastes good but it looks great I'm just going to stir it up just until it's all moist okay into the pan I've got a 9 by 13 inch greased pan just brush it with butter just pour the cornbread and smells good it looks good grated cheddar on the top big shavings of grated cheddar and some chopped scallions to separate that one okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 30 to 35 minutes guess jalapeno cheddar corn bread [Music]
Here's to putting up with me for 45 years. Oh, god. Isn't that gorgeous? Can we start with that? Yeah, we can start with that. So I've got another surprise for you. You do? And it involves a flight in the middle of London. You're kidding? Here's to the best year ever. This was the best chicken I ever had. You say that every Friday. I always come to New York and think about that first time, our first date, when you took me to New York. You took me to Tad's Steakhouse for $1.29 steak dinner. That's right. And I loved you at that moment. That looks great. [interposing voices] What'd you bring? - I brought you some flowers. - You brought me flowers? - Yeah. - Uh-oh. Have you been bad? Thomas Keller's fried chicken. Mm, boy that's good. Is it the best fried chicken you ever had? Next to the one you make, yeah. That's the right answer. So I got you a present-- something you always wanted, Elizabeth David-- Oh, my goodness. --a cookbook. French country cooking, how fabulous. I figured you cook everything in it for me. You got a tent? I thought we sold that 40 years ago. If this tent be rockin', don't be knockin'.
[Music] every Friday night my husband Jeffrey drives three and a half hours to come home for the weekend and I always make them a roast chicken I'm gonna surprise them tonight with a traditional Jewish dinner it's really easy to make and the house is gonna smell just wonderful so here's my plan I'll make a traditional chopped liver appetizer but my way cooked with a little Madeira wine and a brisket pot roast simmered in tomato sauce piled high with carrots and onions quickly sauteed spinach with lots of garlic then melt-in-your-mouth regular cookies with cinnamon sugar apricot jam and raisins and nuts my only problem now is he's gonna want this meal every Friday night it's Friday Geoffrey's coming home tonight just when it's expecting yet another roast chicken I always like to shake it up a little bit so I'm making an old-fashioned Jewish dinner with brisket carrots onions to be really good whoa that's a big piece of meat for two people but it's like making beef stew it lasts forever you can reheat it brisket for do people and I'll show you how easy this I'm gonna make a rub for the top two tablespoons of salt I know it seems like a lot of salt but it's a big piece of brisket 20 tablespoon of garlic chopped up garlic 2 teaspoons of dried oregano and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper smoosh that all together and then rub it on top of the brisket okay that's appropriately smushed together I'm just gonna sprinkle it on the top and then rub it in briskets a great cut of stewing me to buy when you go to the store make sure you don't buy a corned beef brisket which is the same cut but it's already even processed with spices and salt okay that's done I'm gonna put on a pound of carrots just chop them up in chunks it's gonna stew along with the beef I'll be really good these are big cats pound of carrots can be anything from two big carrots to five small ones okay and then eight stalks of celery just cut off the ends a little bit the Brown ends and then just cut it in chunks remember this goes true for three and a half hours celery okay and onions I've got six onions sliced all over the top this already looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't it and some bay leaves for flavor these are beautiful bay leaves six how's that okay and then I'm gonna pour good tomato juice all over the top of it just enough to come up about 3/4 of the way up the beef so just pour right on top and this is gonna make the sauce after it cooks okay now we're just gonna cover it and bake it so I'm gonna cover it with aluminum foil but first because I don't want the foil to touch the tomato juice it wrapped really badly I'll either cover it with plastic wrap or parchment paper [Music] to the oven 350 degrees for about three and a half hours until it's fork-tender so that was pretty fast for dinner that could feed probably ten people but for tonight is just everything so tonight instead of a big dessert I thought maybe with coffee I make little cookies called rugelach they're made with cream cheese dough and a really good vanilla so the first thing I'm going to do is make the dough and the reason why it's so delicious is half a pound of cream cheese is the first ingredient so make it a mixer half a pound of butter [Music] and quarter of a cup of sugar quarter of a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla two cups of flour this is wonderful it's a 2 cup measure just put it in slowly as it gets incorporated [Music] okay once the flowers in don't overmix it that's I end up with really tough pastry so this looks good [Music] dump the dough out to make sure it's well mixed [Music] that accused a really light and flaky dough is to make sure it's well chilled before you roll it out and also before you bake so just make a ball out of it it's good and stinky and because it's just two of us I'm gonna cut it up in quarters freeze three quarters of it and just make cookies out of a quarter for us and then I'll have pastry dough whenever I want to make cookies usually I put this in plastic wrap but little plastic bags work just as well [Music] okay one for the fridge free for the freezer and while it's chilling I'm going to make a nice chopped liver [Music] well you can't have an old-fashioned Jewish meal without a little chopped liver a little matzo so I'm gonna make chopped liver for Jeffrey for anybody who doesn't like chopped liver just think of it as like French pate it's really the same kind of thing so I've done this in two batches I have two pounds of chicken livers and I'm gonna saute them a little bit of chicken fat has to be chicken fat for chopped liver very quickly until they're just barely done you want them a little pink inside if chicken livers are overcooked they can be really dry with it okay these guys are done just take them out as they're done okay now the lots of onions more chicken fat I'm gonna put in onions and just saute them until they're caramelized and browned and just so sweet I've actually asked Jeffrey to run an errand I wonder what he's gonna come back with well I'm asked me to bring home some spinach and that might sound simple but I have screwed it up before I remember the time she asked me to bring back a cantaloupe and I brought back another kind of melon I thought it was a cantaloupe but it it was not a success so I approach this with a little apprehension oh this looks like the spinach this must be curly spinach and this must be baby spinach I'll get a bit of each just to play it safe okay great success yes so I'm gonna finish the chopped liver before shepard gets back from his errand this is an unusual ingredient my chopped liver is Madeira it's a fortified dessert wine and it's a little sweet I had a third of a cup deglazes the pan and gets all those scrapings out I'm just gonna pour this right into the chicken livers this is a mixture that I'm gonna chop up later maybe chicken livers but anything tastes good with all those onions on it okay the next thing is for hard cooked eggs just gonna chop them up just roughly [Music] now quarter of a cup of chopped parsley it smells good rough chop okay two teaspoons of fresh thyme two teaspoons of soul it's appropriate def kosher salt for this one teaspoon of pepper and I asked put a pinch of cayenne to give it a little bit of heat and I'm gonna mix this in the food processor with more of the chicken fat just enough to make it the right consistency I'm gonna chop it roughly you don't want to pureed that's pretty good I'm gonna chill it and then I'm gonna taste it when it's all chilled for seasoning make sure it has enough salt pepper this isn't Jeffrey's ordinary Friday night dinner [Music] I'm gonna chill it'll be ready for dinner tonight with a little matzo so I think the briskets ready let's just check it out if this is enough for two people for dinner [Music] brisket vegetables it's a whole meal in one check and make sure the meats done perfect should be fork-tender but not like falling apart liked it take me that let it rest for a little bit and then I'm gonna boil the sauce down so it gets thickened okay cover this with foil I'm just going to turn the flame on under yes so let's go simmer away for about 30 minutes and now I'm going to finish the regular just that wonderful little cook [Music] time to make the cookies so the rug Allah is a cream-cheese dough and the trapped around a filling of cinnamon sugar walnuts and raisins so one cup of walnuts chopped up six tablespoons of granulated sugar quarter cup of brown sugar a teaspoon a good cinnamon three quarters of a cup of raisins just mix that all together it smells so good that cannot be bad the cream cheese dough that we refrigerated earlier it's nice and firm just want to roll this out to a nine inch circle flour on my counter I mean you're only something in a circle just go from the center to the outside don't roll back and forth make a nice circle and try not to touch it so it doesn't get warm the colder it is the better the cookies will be the more flaky the dough is I'm going to spread it apricot jam i pureed it in the food processor so it's really fine it's really beautiful this cookie actually is great made with lots of different feelings we raspberry jams wonderful and sometimes it's even done in chocolate but I really like the traditional apricot so just a very thin layer of jam don't neglect the edges okay and now just mix up the filling a nice even layer all the way around okay press down on the filling into the dough lightly then want to make a mess okay now I take my knife and cut it in quarters okay then each quarter cut into thirds okay starting from the wider edge just roll it up towards bend it a little so it's a crescent and just put it right on the cookie sheet lined with parchment paper okay just keep rolling them up and when you put it on the baking sheet make sure the little tips are down so that the heads down okay last one it's a really messy job but it's worth it the cookies are so good it's gonna chill them and they'll have nice and flaky Jeffrey should be home any minute I'm just gonna get the tip liver ready for him you know just because it's chopped liver doesn't mean it can't be served in a beautiful silver bowl so hi hi sweetie what'd you bring you got two guys two kinds of spinach with it whatever kind you need hey what's that why'd you bring me two tons of spinach well I figured that too different as opposed to the time you went out for a lemon or came back with a grapefruit yeah this is a really nice baby spinach yeah I thought so but I want that okay [Music] Cheers so what's for dinner it's a surprise can you give me a hint it's not chicken it's not true how about if you get yourself ready and I finish dinner okay okay I'm taking this with okay I'm so good you're home [Music] okay last step to those cookies I'm gonna make an egg wash and weed cinnamon and sugar they're gonna go into the up three tablespoons of sugar teaspoon of cinnamon really is like taking cinnamon toast together brush the top with that wash it's best time my grandmother used to make okay maybe the oven 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes and they're gonna be crisp and delicious now I have to sautee the spinach to slice the meat I think Jeffrey's gonna be a very happy guy [Music] so I've got almost everything done for my Friday night dinner the briskets cooked the sauce is thickened I'm gonna make some spinach so that should be more than enough for the two of us just Jeffrey and me for dinner it's gonna put it right in the pan and just lay it out like that well it looks pretty good great I'm gonna pour the sauce over it and the vegetables that carrots and onions I'm just gonna keep it really moist mmm just just delicious okay into the oven keep it warm until we're ready for dinner okay I'm gonna make a really fast sauteed spinach with garlic I know there's olive oil and butter because you get the high burning temperature of olive oil and the flavor of butter good combination little butter I've got some chopped garlic spinach and garlic's great combination just toss it in hmm girl like an oil how bad can that be got the spinach or washed it's the baby spinach it's really tender it's tender and if you can make a salad out of it but I'm cooking it just dumped it right in remember spinach cooks out in very little so you want to do a lot really good spinach just toss it around a little bit salt and pepper [Applause] okay put the lid on you'd be surprised it looks like a lot but when I come back to be that big so it should be done oh my god there's nothing left it's perfect I've lots of brisket okay into the bowl lots of garlic just a little squeeze of lemon sweetie dinner's ready

butternut squash is perfect thing for risotto with saffron the staphon's really spicy and the butternut squash is really sweet when you're peeling butternut squash you want to use a nice sharp PLA not those sort of vegetable peelers that you find in the hardware store you want something really good and this one's really sharp this is the quickest way I find to peel it just fill the entire outside and then get a really good big sharp knife major knife cut it in half keep your fingers out of the way just like that at the end like this so stand it up cut it in half you can boil this but instead I'm going to actually roast it I think it really brings out the sweetness sort of caramelize is it a little bit so this parts the easy part just a good dice so that's the top of this and then the bottom just going to cut it in half take out the seeds you can actually roast those I like pumpkin seeds so for the butternut squash and then again just on big cubes they don't have to be perfect square so don't obsess about it [Music] okay that's one butternut squash little olive oil stand temper okay chop it all together into the oven 400 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes until it's really tender and sweet butternut squash is already in the oven it smells so good I need six cups of chicken stock I really liked any film made chicken stock but if you don't have it use a king [Music] okay now some pancetta pancetta Italian bacon but frankly any kind of good quality bacon would do too so I'm just going to dice it up it gives great flavor to risotto so some butter that six tablespoons into the pot and the pancetta need two large shallots or about a half a cup okay now I need we're going to have cups of arborio rice it's the Italian rice really special for risotto just going to pour it right in okay that's good all the rice is coated with butter so it's perfect I'm going to add a half a cup of white wine now this is a key to good risotto is you want to add chicken stock by the ladleful to ladle to the time if you add it too fast the risotto cooks on the outside and on the inside if you add it too slowly it gets mushy two ladles and then I'm going to add the key ingredient which is saffron I love it's spicy it's the stamens of crocuses which is why it's so expensive that a teaspoon of saffron give it a stir and then probably take about 25 minutes as the stock is absorbed into the rice you just want to add another few ladle full it's just a little more stock butternut squash is perfect I want to do this as soon as the risotto is completely cooked and the rice is done to stir it in and the last thing I need is one cup of grated Parmesan and this is the most delicious lunch all in one pot and the good news is it's ready look risotto updating you it is good butternut squash risotto is thank you
[Music] I was trying to come up with my list of all-time favorite desserts would be something frozen something chocolate pie maybe a crisp was so hard to decide I went through all my old recipes and I realized what I liked best are the classics update it first summer pudding is traditionally a cake with cooked berries and bread but I'm making it even better with delicious brioche then my favorite comfort food rice pudding but I'm turning up the volume by adding good dark rum I'm making a traditional key lime pie even better by adding lots of fresh lime zest and serving it frozen and then two new recipes my favorite creme anglaise made into ice cream with vanilla and cognac and finally homemade caramel sauce for a quick dessert poured over ice cream or cake everyone says they don't want dessert but when I serve these my friends seem to clean their plates in the summer when the local berries are ripe and they're just right off the vine there's nothing better than a big bowl of fresh berries dusted with confectioners sugar and just serve it with a little cookie it's wonderful but every once in a while I want to do something really over-the-top and that's the time and I like to make summer pudding which is layers of cooked berries and brioche and it comes out like a cake it's so fantastic [Music] one pint of strawberries one and a half cups of sugar a little bit of water about a quarter of a cup I'm gonna cook this all together and it's gonna be a wonderful stewed berry that's gonna be absorbed by all that gorgeous brioche and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add more berries to it to half pints of fresh raspberries I love to make this in the summer when the berries are particularly good but can really get good berries from California almost all year long to have kinds of fresh blueberries these look like good blueberries and I'm gonna leave one of the half pints of raspberries to put in later just because I want some Cooke berries and some fresh berries in it so this is gonna cook for about five minutes on a very low flame just like a low simmer okay so while that's happening I'm gonna cut the brioche up I'm gonna do 1/2 inch thick slices stack them all up cut off the crust cause that's big that it's more like cake and it is bread so the berries should be done by now and they are it's perfect so but I turn it off and the last thing when they do just to give us some real texture I did another half kind of fresh raspberries 2 tablespoons of crème blush which is raspberry paired with brandy and it just gives it so much flavor that'll do it so this is a souffle there's 7 or 8 inches it doesn't really matter and I want something that's tall enough so after it's set when I turn it out it's high like a cake it would look great so the first thing is a ladle full of cooked berries in the bottom of the bowl I'm gonna take the brioche and fit it in the bottom remember when you turn it over that's gonna be the top so I want to be sure that there's a really pretty layer of brioche and I'm gonna start by doing it around like this let's see how does this fit in so it's you wanted to be sure it fits in nicely so that's just gonna sit in there and now another layer of berries I mean I could smell the friend blahs when it hits the heat really doesn't a great job of flavoring it and what the oh Sh I find it's easier to assemble it if I cut this in triangles but you sort of can sort of squish it together and fit it in so it fits right just it's like a jigsaw puzzle just fit it together more berries in juice less layer so now when I turn this out this is the bottom one of the best parts I said it comes out raspberry red and it's just gorgeous so now I'm just gonna wait it with a plate that's just smaller than the circumference of the souffle dish and then put some kind of a can on top and it's just gonna sit on there for about six or eight hours until it gets sort of denser and absolutely delicious and then I'll take it off and it's gonna be ready whenever I want it then after eight hours in the refrigerator it was time for the moment of truth turning the summer pudding out just run a knife on the outside the time I always hold my breath but looks great with berries in the brioche [Music] and it looked that outrageous and so he'd smell the berries and the Brio she's gonna be just wonderful people are so shocked by it [Music] so it berries are in season in the summer the strawberries and raspberries and blueberries I buy extra keeping in the freezer for last-minute dessert it's a great party dessert they take about an hour to freeze and I serve them with hot white chocolate sauce it's so easy to make you just melt one pound of white chocolate with a cup of heavy cream and half a teaspoon of vanilla extract the berries are ice cold the chocolate is hot it's an amazing combination next I'm gonna make creme anglaise and then after that I'm gonna go back to a time when I made rum raisin rice pudding the most wonderful cozy fireside dinner now we're gonna make creme anglaise which is a vanilla custard dessert sauce it's delicious to serve with hot and cold desserts but it's also the base for wonderful ice cream half a cup of sugar and then mix those together and I have scalded milk right there on the stove I need 1 and 3/4 cups of scalded milk which is milk that's heated to just below the boiling point 1 teaspoon of cornstarch goes into the eggs and sugar mixture and now I'm gonna add the milk very slowly because I don't want scrambled eggs I want a beautiful sauce you can really add any kind of flavoring to a sauce like this but I particularly like vanilla and cognac so that's what I'm doing okay that's perfect it's gonna pour this back into the pan and cook it over very low heat until it just begins to thicken and then later I'm gonna flavor it and in the meantime I'm gonna show you how to make rum raisin rice pudding yeah so the first thing for rice pudding you need rice and I cooked about 3/4 of a cup of basmati rice I actually love to use basmati rice it's sort of got a nuttier flavor and it's like a whole grain rice so it's wonderful and rice pudding so that's cooked for about 8 or 9 minutes with a little bit of salt and now I'm gonna add 4 cups of half-and-half if you want to be good you can use milk but I want this to be delicious I'm gonna turn up the heat and then have a cup of sugar and just let that cook for about 25 minutes I'm gonna bring up the heat until it boils and then lower it and let it simmer for about 25 minutes until the rice is perfectly cooked and then I'm gonna add all these great flavors so I'm gonna take about 3/4 of a cup of raisins and 2 tablespoons are really good rum I love good dark rum it's got such a great flavor just pour it over I'm just gonna mix them up a little bit so the raisins soaked in all that rum these are just gonna sit here and get better and better wonderful so I'm just gonna turn this down to simmer and let it cook for 25 minutes the rice is ready looks just gorgeous creamy but I just want to make sure the rice grains we're done this is not the place for out that day it's great it's creamy I know it sounds like most rice pudding is actually made with milk and then you had a heavy cream at the end so I thought why not just make it easier and make it all half and a half just stir that in I'm just gonna add one egg and just stir it in slowly I'm just gonna give the rice pudding a really good texture okay and while that's cooking for a minute I'm gonna add one and a half teaspoons of vanilla and the rum and raisins that I've been soaked for about a half-hour [Music] so good and then just put it right in [Music] yikes stir it up mmm this looks so good I love him the rum hits the heat and you just get that whiff of rum it's sort of like raisin ice cream so I'm just gonna put it in a bowl and chill it and then it'll be ready for dessert I'm gonna put a little bit of film right over the top so it doesn't I'm just again I'd say that's when we really nice dessert on a chilly winter night in front of the fireplace and indeed it was when my friend and weena came for dinner and for the grand finale Wow but it's rice pudding [Laughter] rum-raisin rice pudding is good warm in the winter there's also delicious cold in the summer if you know somebody's not feeling too well it's the desert equivalent of chicken soup to make them feel better immediately so I'm just watching this creme anglaise it's just getting thick now you never want to let it boil just up to about a hundred and eighty degrees and it just thickens slightly until it coats the spoon and that's perfect it's done so I'm going to is I'm gonna strain it just to make sure there are no lumps in it just pour it right through a strainer great nice and smooth I'm gonna add a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and one and a half teaspoons of brandy or cognac whichever you have in the pantry don't go buy cognac just for one and a half teaspoons you can do rum whatever it tastes good just stir it up mmm I love the smell of vanilla and cognac together and then if you really want to be over-the-top and you have a vanilla bean around I'd love to put the seeds of vanilla bean into this not only flavors but then it looks like vanilla cut it in half we're in your life right along with vanilla bean and then put the seeds right in then stir it up refrigerate this next I'm going to show you Geoffrey's favorite dessert key lime hi frozen key lime pie is one of our all-time favorite summer desserts and what's wonderful is you don't even have to roll out the crust you just Pat it in I'll show you how I make it it just makes one and a half cups of graham cracker crumbs with a quarter cup of sugar and six tablespoons of melted butter press it into a pie pan no rolling pins and then just bake it 350 degrees for 10 minutes what it's cooled I'm gonna make the filling which is exactly what I did when I made this pie for Jeffrey this is my kind of cooking no cooking at all I've whipped six egg yolks in the mixer with a better quarter of a cup of sugar and now I'm gonna add sweetened condensed milk this is a really traditional recipe but I think this has more flavor than most yeah and to fish that lid out so I'm going to pour it in on low speed just so it mixes in make sure you get it all ah I even got it on the mixer that's nice the next thing is lime zest I always use lime juice but I think the zest has more flavor than the juice so I make sure that I get a lot in this is my handy dandy rasp I love it so that's about two tablespoons of lime zest just goes right in and the last ingredient is freshly squeezed lime juice it's about 3/4 of a cup well this looks so great you can see all the zest and the filling and that's it I'm just gonna pour it into my baked pie shell so it was into the freezer until it was frozen and then it was time to decorate it about a cup of heavy cream wearing part of it quarter cup of sugar and some vanilla and while that's going I'm just gonna slice up some lines I just think it's really important for something to be decorated with a flavor that it is so when you look at it you know exactly that it's line perfect you want it so it's really firm but not but it hasn't turned into butter yet so that's perfect and sometimes when I'm feeling up to it I'll pipe it in a decorative way but I think now it's gonna be really casual America right in the middle just so you can see the frozen key lime pie around the edges but you have the whipped cream in the middle just like that it's easy it's earthy and then with some fresh lime that's just wonderful really superb well I have to tell you this is the best working on a new recipe I'm always trying to find a balance of flavors a little bit of layering a little complexity but not unusual flavors I find it occur sometimes exactly what I'm looking for some like rum and friend wise I use over and over again and the cognac that I used earlier for the creme on glass but I think my favorite is Grand Marnier it's an orange liqueur and it gives chocolate an incredible depth of flavor like with chocolate mousse it's a fabulous and then there's chocolate gotta have chocolate so I always keep the chocolate chips on hand if I want to make really quick chocolate sauce and borås of chocolate to make Chocolate Chunk cookies not bad and I actually also keep jars of good chocolate sauce available so if you make a really good ice cream sundae speaking of ice cream sundaes I particularly love caramel sauce I'll show you how I make it [Music] well the cremon glaze is nice and cool now I left some in the fridge to serve over berries but this I'm gonna make into ice cream pour it right into the ice cream maker and next I'm gonna show you a really delicious caramel sauce that's so easy to make ice cream with caramel sauce who wouldn't want that for dessert a thing about caramel sauce is you watch it and you watch it and you watch it and nothing happens the second you walk away it burns so I'm just going to keep watching this until the sugar and the water in the pan turns sort of a golden nutty brown and I think we're there that's one and a half cups of sugar and a third of a cup of water and it took about ten minutes to get to this stage okay and then I have to add two ingredients heavy cream one and a quarter cups now this is the critical stage I'm going to turn the stove off when I pour the cold cream into the hot caramel I just want to stand back because it's gonna really bubble up a little bit of vanilla extract and then I'm just gonna cook it until the caramel melts into the heavy cream and I've got caramel sauce just gonna slowly combine that looks delicious it looks dangerous and we have caramel sauce this is the ice cream I made with a creme on glass I can actually smell the cognac and vanilla and I just happen to have some homemade caramel sauce very dear friend of mine says when you invite people for dinner you never remember what you serve for dinner but they always remember dessert [Music]
I have dear friends coming for breakfast tomorrow and unlike a disastrous breakfast party I had many years ago this time I'm gonna have everything done today so I can have fun tomorrow when I was first married my husband and I decided to give a party and we invited everybody for breakfast and I decided I would make an omelette for everyone what a bad idea that was I spent the entire time in the kitchen like Cinderella though fast-forward 35 years and I've invited some friends for breakfast and I'm gonna have everything made the day before and I'm gonna have a really good time at my own party I like to be a guest so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make scones I'm gonna make the dough today and then tomorrow I'm just gonna take them out of the fridge and bake them off and we'll have hot scones fresh in the morning and I didn't have to get up at 4:00 a.m. to do it so I take three quarters of a pound of butter I know it's a lot of butter but you have to use it to make good scones so the first thing I needs 4 cups of flour 2 tablespoons of sugar 2 tablespoons of baking powder which is gonna make them nice and light and 2 teaspoons of salt I'm just gonna mix up the dry ingredients first so it's really well blended so I've got the flour sugar baking powder and salt and now I'm going to take the really cold butter and just put it in I'm going to mix it a little bit until the butter is about the size of peas it's going to mix it for a little bit we'll need about a cup of heavy cream and it has to be cold because you don't want the butter to get soft when you put the heavy cream in and then for eggs who just made it okay so this is just gonna go right in to the dough it's gonna make a very very wet dough but it's gonna mean that the scones are gonna be really moist and just mix it just enough cuz you don't want to over mix the butter so I need about three quizzes of a cup of raisins and I'm just gonna flour them a little bit this prevents the raisins from sticking together when you put them in the scones I'm just gonna put them right in okay there we are it's a really sticky dough so I'm gonna flour the board really well so making the dough tonight and then I'm gonna put them in the refrigerator all cut out and tomorrow morning all I have to do is pop them in the oven and we'll have hot scones first thing in the morning this is gonna be so good I'm gonna make raspberry butter which will be really good on the scones but the main course is a frittata a potato basil frittata and it's gonna be wonderful so this this looks great the dough is nice and cold I'm gonna flour a little more and you want to be sure the raisins are evenly distributed okay so I'm just going to Pat this out or I'll roll it out to about 3/4 of an inch thick that was perfect gorgeous so when a flower the cutter and I do it in squares and then I cut the squares in half and we have triangles okay so we've cut squares and then I'm gonna cut them in half diagonally and we'll have gorgeous triangles so tomorrow morning when I take them out of the fridge I'm gonna brush them with egg wash and sprinkle them with sugar the egg wash is gonna make them nice and brown and the sugar is gonna make them Sparkle well so now these are gonna go on the fridge and then I'm gonna show you how to make my favorite homemade granola so in a big bowl I'm gonna mix together four cups of oats and just use regular oats that you can buy at the grocery store Oh - great two cups of coconut two cups of almonds and I'm gonna toss this all together and now I'm gonna take 3/4 of a cup of oil and half a cup of honey good honey mmm I'm just gonna toss this with my oats almonds and coconut toss it all together you'll believe how brown and delicious and crisp this comes out and whatever's left over will just sit on the pantry okay great you put it on a sheet pan I'm gonna bake this at 350 for about 45 minutes until it's nice and brown and crisp so tomorrow morning I'm going to add lots of dried foods and it's so delicious where my favorite recipes of all time is orange yogurt the idea of this is that I drain the yogurt a lot of the liquid comes out and then I replace it with things that taste much better like fresh orange juice generally when you drain things people recommend that use cheesecloth but you always have paper towels at home so why not a paper towel so I'm gonna put it right in this strainer take a quart of yogurt and just put it in the strainer you can use whole milk yogurt low-fat yogurt whatever you want to use just plain yogurt I'm just gonna let this drain overnight and you'll be surprised how much liquid comes out and then tomorrow I'm gonna replace the liquid with fresh orange juice honey and wonderful flavorings like vanilla and raisins and nuts it'll be so good so the last thing I have to do before I hit the sack let's check my granola yeah it looks great smells warned if I can smell the almonds and them coconut and all the oats just gonna leave it to sit overnight until it's cool time to hit the sack tomorrow so I need some rolls for a bread basket for breakfast so you want to give me like a assorted rolls my favorite cinnamon coffee like preserves that are hold fruit not too sweet my friends coming for breakfast and rather than getting up at six o'clock in the morning to get everything ready I've gotten most of it done last night and I just have a few things left to do I've raisin scones and I'm just gonna brush them with egg wash and a little sugar to give them a glaze a glistening look egg wash can really be anything it can be an egg and a little bit of water egg and milk half-and-half whatever you have around just to make gorgeous on the top and a little bit of sugar to make them look good and into the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes until they're big and gorgeous and golden so while that's happening I'm gonna make the easiest thing you've ever seen made it's raspberry butter it's basically two ingredients raspberry jam and butter so I take room-temperature butter I'm just gonna use a quarter of a pound of butter and about 1/2 a cup of raspberry jam and mix them together how easy is that because I use unsalted butter I'm just gonna take a pinch of salt into Don this is the best part making sure it's okay mmm it's sweet and it's creamy and it's gonna be so good on the scones yeah put it aside and now I'm gonna show you how to make a perfect cup of coffee I don't know why people find this daunting it starts with really one thing good coffee if you buy inexpensive bitter coffee beans you're gonna end up with bitter coffee hello so this is what I'm gonna do I'm pouring 8 cups of water into the back of the coffee maker and then use a filter of course my favorite coffee the secret is for every 2 cups of water one heaping tablespoon of coffee I mean really heaping like that so I have 8 cups of water I'm gonna put in four heaping tablespoons of coffee and you'll have delicious coffee every time but be sure you buy really good coffee I'm gonna turn that on and just because I hate emptying a coffee maker to make decaf I have two coffee makers it's a small investment and it makes it so much easier so I'm gonna make a whole pot of decaf also I think more and more people are drinking decaf so it's great to be prepared so again I've got eight cups of coffee I'm going to do four heaping tablespoons of decaf so the next thing when it finishes Micra know what this is so good this is all the baked oats and almonds and coconut with a little bit of honey and and it's absolutely delicious the way it is it's like crisp and sweet and good for you but I'm gonna make it even better I let it sit overnight so that we'd get cool and now I'm gonna add all kinds of dried fruit to it to make it over-the-top granola so I've got figs you know the thing about granola it's so good is that you can its really good for you you can make a huge batch and leave it for a long time in a sealed container on the shelf it doesn't go bad so just chop figs and then chopped apricots lots of good chopped apricots it gives it lots of color and texture I think I'm just gonna do big chunks of that so it looks great the reason why I use dried fruit is so that there's not so much moisture in the fruit and if you use fresh fruit like fresh strawberries while it's great to serve over fresh strawberries you don't want to store them together because the Cronulla will get really soggy so we've got apricots and figs and these are wonderful mmm or dried cranberries in their tart and they're sweet and they're just delicious I dried cherries I'm just gonna mix all of these together I'm gonna have the most gorgeous granola for breakfast that's gonna be great my friends are coming for breakfast I love to do breakfast because it's not the traditional Saturday night dinner which is such a major deal most of the things I've done the night before which is great but the main centerpiece of the meal is a potato basil for Tata so in the pan here I've cooked about two cups of boiling potatoes they're the firm round ones rather than the baking potatoes and I peeled them and just cooking a little better for about 10 or 15 minutes until they're really just tender and browned and that should be perfect right now now I'm gonna make the basis of it which is this gorgeous omelet all mixed together I'm gonna start with just like an omelet eight eggs and I actually find that you can use whatever's left over from dinner if you have chicken and broccoli the night before it makes a delicious frittata counting one more I just scramble them a little bit and then I'm gonna add lots of great flavorings but 15 ounces of ricotta which is one whole small container and then 3/4 of a pound of green cheese Greer's it's wonderful like Swiss cheese I know it's eggs cheese and butter it's delicious how bad can that be and then a little bit of butter the last major food group I'm not suggesting you eat this every day but once in a while for a treat it's wonderful and then basil I think basil is just such a great flavoring so we'll just take the leaves off the stems and chop them very roughly mmm I love the smell of fresh basil and then the last two ingredients our third of a cup of flour to give a little substance and 3/4 of teaspoon of baking powder to make it rise what you see this when it comes out of the oven it's all puffed and golden and brown it's really a showstopper and it's this easy to make so I'm gonna stir this all together make sure it's nicely blended cheeses and the basil and eggs and that's it I'm just gonna pour this right over the potato and then this whole thing goes in the oven so instead of making individual almost for everybody I have one big omelet we're all gonna share it so it goes in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes to an hour and it's gonna be puffed and golden and delicious excellent so one of the treats about this breakfast most of the table decoration is gonna be totally edible and I'm gonna cut up all kinds of gorgeous fruit and put it down the middle of the table I'll show you how easy it is I have this thing about fruit that it needs to be all one color I hate when things are mixed up and they look like a bowl of M&amp;Ms so first thing I'm gonna do is papaya look how great they are with the black seeds and I actually like to just leave it this way cuz it's so beautiful whom people can scoop the seeds out and I can smell the pie it smells wonderful one of the things I find is I have these hydrangea leaves in my bush but you can also get lemon leaves from the florist and just look what a difference it makes in the papaya I'm gonna do a plate of strawberries so one big platter of strawberries it's just so much prettier than a plate of a million different kinds of fruit and maybe one little leaf tucked under there so that's the strawberries how easy is this and let's say the last one is it's a glia melon it's an it's an Israeli no this is really when you're going shopping for melons don't squeeze it because you'll just bruise it all you want to do is just smell it and it smells like the mill and it's ripe and this one smells incredible it's sweet and fragrant and it's like a honeydew inside but it's incredibly delicious and I've been able to get them quite quite often now just go scoop the little seeds out put down some of my hydrangea leaves any kind of a broad flat leaf like this really works well and then just do wedges and people can help themselves I can't wait to eat this melon it's just gorgeous so just like that and that should be it so I'm going to take these out to the table it'll be part of the gorgeous decoration so all the fruits set and then I'm going to put everything else I'm homemade granola and the yogurt down the middle of the table and we'll all sit have a wonderful time together so my friends are coming for breakfast and I've made delicious things yesterday so I can be relaxed today I made raisin scones and granola and this is orange yogurt which is really wonderful what I've done is drain the yogurt I've drained the liquid out of it and I'm going to throw that out it makes it very thick and I'm going to add the liquid back by adding fresh orange juice to it and lots of delicious things so the first thing to add is raisins and walnuts I'm just gonna chop them roughly I love this yogurt because it's got wonderful flavor it's sweet with a little bit bit of honey and it's tart with the orange juice and it's got great texture with the raisins and walnuts some raisins this is really casual cooking I love to use the zest of oranges because it's got the most flavor of the orange and this is my handy dandy zester I love it okay a little bit of orange zest and then honey which will make a delicious and sweet mmm ain't good vanilla just cuz I love vanilla mmm I love the smell of that betta teaspoon and a half of vanilla so I'm gonna do is add back freshly squeezed orange juice until it's the same consistency as the original yogurt so now you just want to reconstitute it basically so that frittata maybe a little decadent with the granola yogurt oh good for you so I figure they all balance out okay let's see if it's right hmmm it's so sweet from the honey and the orange juice and it's got crunchiness from the walnuts and raisins it's gonna be so delicious with the granola I can't wait for you and I'll get some for your casa just hit you're all still hungry I have a potato patient for town Oh what's in this I know it's potatoes and basil and ricotta this is an idea of a great way to start the day breakfast with my friends the door swung open on a gorgeous day but I mean that the scones are gonna be really moist and just mix it just enough cuz you don't want to over mix the butter so I need about three kinds of a cup of raisins and I'm just gonna flour them a little bit this prevents the raisins from sticking together when you put them in the scones I'm just gonna put them right in okay there we are it's a really sticky dough so I'm gonna flour the board really well I have dear friends coming for breakfast tomorrow and unlike a disastrous breakfast party I had many years ago this time I'm gonna have everything done today so I can have fun tomorrow you when I was first married my husband and I decided to give a party and we invited everybody for breakfast and I decided I would make an omelette for everyone what a bad idea that was I spent the entire time in the kitchen like Cinderella though fast-forward 35 years I've invited some friends for breakfast and I'm gonna have everything made the day before and I'm gonna have a really good time at my own party I like to be a guest so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make scones I want to make the dough today and then tomorrow I'm just gonna take them out of the fridge and bake them off and we'll have hot scones fresh in the morning and I didn't have to get up at 4 a.m. to do it so I take 3/4 of a pound of butter right until the butter is about the size of peas it's gonna mix it for a little bit we'll need about a cup of heavy cream and it has to be cold because you don't want the butter to get soft when you put the heavy cream in and then for eggs who just made it okay so this is just gonna go right in to the dough it's gonna make a very very wet dough but it's no it's a lot of butter but you have to use it to make good scones so the first thing I use four cups of flour two tablespoons of sugar two tablespoons of baking powder which is gonna make them nice and light and two teaspoons of salt I'm just gonna mix up the dry ingredients first so it's really well blended so I've got the flour sugar baking powder and salt and now I'm going to take the really cold butter and just put it in I'm going to mix it a little bit
this weekend took a little vacation one of my favorite city Chicago I'm here visiting a couple friends who are of course gay florists but even though I'm out of the Hamptons I still can't manage to get my way out of cooking I'm so excited because Jeffrey's finally coming home from a two-month business trip to Mykonos how fun is that he'll be flying in tomorrow so I of course have to have a meal ready and waiting for him the moment he walks in the door this weekend I only have about twenty dollars in my wallet so I decided to make my famous twenty dollar chicken salad that's just out of this world and bursting with flavor it's Jeffrey's absolute favorite I used to be his favorite it's simple it's fresh it's the only reason I'm still married Jeffrey didn't tell me that when he was going to Mykonos for two months he was going to take the good Amex letting me strapped for cash luckily this chicken salad recipe is super easy and simple to make it's four ingredients and then you bind it together neither mayonnaise or cream cheese whatever you have on hand just put it in Jeffrey never puts in Japanese everybody's any meal so let's get started so first we're just going to start with some boiled chicken I've got about a pound of it here and I'm going to slice it up into tiny bite-size pieces one thing I love about Chicago is spending little bakeries I tell them I'm a piano teacher and gain their trust and they get discounts on brioche now the next ingredient is just about a cup of chopped grapes now you want to chop them in either halves or quarters depending on the size but you'll want them very petite mix I was just bag of walnuts already chopped about a quarter of a cup that's a real earthy flavor to that Jeffrey loves nuts he doesn't want you i nuts great now the last thing you'll need is just a red onion I made about half of it and you'll want to dice it actually probably a nice immense will be much better I have to hurry up and finish this before Jeffrey get something I don't see thanks me I'm just kidding Jeffrey never touches you now the last ingredient we're going to use is mayonnaise back in my bag oh that's complete Jeffrey now hi honey where are you dinner's almost ready listen sweetheart my flight got canceled so I'm gonna stay but I made your favorite chicken okay great
--So Ina, we asked one recipe that you should have in your cooking arsenal ... --Yeah --... and you said vinaigrette. --It should be vinaigrette, because I think people are afraid of vinaigrette. They think it's some esoteric recipe. But, in fact, it's faster to make it than it is to go to the store and buy a bottle of dressing, and it's so much better. So you want me to show you I made my mustard vinaigrette. So the first thing is you need good vinegar. I'm going to need some garlic -- you're a cook. Do you want to mince it for me? One clove of garlic So I'm going to do three tablespoons of champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar, whatever you like. You can use red wine vinegar, whatever your taste is. And, I'm just going to flavor it with lots of good stuff. So first is mustard. So half a teaspoon of mustard goes right in. And I actually do it in a measuring cup, so you can measure and mix at the same time instead of it in a bowl. And so the next thing is salt and pepper and perfectly minced. Want to put it right in? Got three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, some pepper. And then I actually put a raw egg yolk in. If you don't want to eat raw egg yolk don't do it. Some people get weirded out by it. I know. It emulsifies it. So what I do is I buy organic eggs and I use the egg yolks. But everybody has to decide that for themselves. So one egg yolk, and it has to be room temperature. Is there a good substitute in case people don't want to use it? --Just leave it out. --Leave it out? --Yeah. Actually if you use a little more mustard, it emulsifies it a little bit too. This is particularly good. So just whisk it together like this, and then what I do is I pour the olive oil in slowly and then you'll see -- it's going to emulsify it, which is really like making mayonnaise, but much thinner. So, actually, I serve salad, not so much as a first course. I never serve it with a main course because I think it's kind of too messy on the plate. But I serve it the way the French do: after the dinner with a little piece of cheese and a baguette, just a great sort of way to pace the meal. Should we taste this and see if it's the right balance? --It's delicious. --Delicious. I think it needs a little more salt because you want it to be really highly seasoned. A little more pepper. --So balancing the acid in there. Yeah, exactly. And you can use really anything. I make vinaigrettes with lemon juice and olive oil, salt and pepper. It's my favorite. It goes on everything. Okay, so, now next thing is to make a salad, which is pretty easy, right? So, you want to bring over the bowl? I always use a wooden salad bowl, and I like to mix them. So this is arugula. [inaudible] It's washed. It's dried. It's very important for it to be dry, and then we're going to put a little mesclun mix in. It's so nice that it's all washed already. I like that you use different types of lettuce. I do. I just think it's great flavor and it's great color. It looks more interesting, doesn't it? And then sometimes, I'll add endive, which has a little bite to it. Just slice it right across like that. Just add that to it. And maybe some radicchio. It adds a little bit of bitterness, which I kind of like. Just like this straight-across, and you can do torn leaves, any way you like it. That's just fine. There's no right way or wrong way to do salad. Isn't that prettier? Toss it all together like that. A little vinaigrette on it, just enough to moisten the leaves and this is why it's so important that the leaves are dry because water on the leaves-- Yeah, you want to toss that? An expert salad-tosser. A little touch of salt on it, just gives it a lot of flavor. A little extra pepper. Now, wasn't that faster than going to the store and buying a bottle of dressing? And then, what do you have? Bottled-up dressing. This is just delicious. Should we taste it to make sure it's good? Isn't that good? --That's delicious. It's really simple and [inaudible]. Okay, so now we're going to make course out of it. So a little bit of salad. This is called Delice. It's a wonderful creamy cheese, and I'm just going to do a little slice. Do you want to put the salad on the-- some salad on the plate? And a little slice of cheese So we can put the cheese right on top, how's that? Just like that. So that's the cheese, a little baguette. Just a big slice of baguette, and you have a whole course and, basically, there was no cooking at all. Isn't that amazing? Just like that. How nice is that? Salad and cheese. Absolutely. --My favorite ingredients all together. --All the major food groups. Thank you so much.
[Music] this is a challah it's um it's an egg bread that's been braided it's sort of a traditional Jewish bread but you can use any kind of egg bread or brioche bread that comes in a loaf I'm just going to leave this to dry out a little bit so when I mix it with a customer's it will just absorb all that flavor so the custard six eggs and I always try and crack the eggs on the board rather than on the side of the dish so you don't get shells in them I like to use extra-large eggs but you can really use large eggs anything that you have around extra-large eggs I find our better value there's more egg for Donnell or how's that for an esoteric fact okay and the next thing it is milk or half and half if you really want to be over the top it's a cup and a half of whole milk or half and half I want to keep my husband around for a long time so I'll he is milk I was going to whisk it in when I was thinking about the dress today I wanted to make traditional french toast but I won't really wanted to pump up those flavor so challah does that which is great but also I wanted the custard to have more flavor so what I'm going to do is I'll show you I'm going to add orange which is a really traditional breakfast kind of thing my handy dandy microplane which I love someone add a little bit of orange maybe about a teaspoon can we make this to your own taste if you like more orange or less orange play with it until you get it exactly right and the next thing Pinilla so about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and honey honey Leaton it but I think it's sweetened it with more flavor than sugar just white sugar really doesn't do anything for me and doesn't that look good and the last thing is a pinch of salt it's amazing how much salt makes the difference in a recipe like this so now the cut has lots of flavor when I'm going to soak the bread it'll just absorb all that good flavor I'm going to soak the kyla in the custard just a couple of minutes on both sides just to hold it down so it gets nicely soaked if you can soak it for five minutes it's great if you don't have the time and you're too hungry it's okay but the longer you soak it and actually the drier the bread is the better actually so one recipe where you had to let it sit for half an hour now just imagine that everybody sitting waiting for breakfast and you have to stand there for half an hour and let it soak forget it so while that's okay let me get the butter so let me have a better tablespoon of butter when I'm sauteing things I want to mix butter and oil because I'll get the flavor of the butter at the high burning temperature of the oil so by the tablespoon of oil should do it that's perfect get it nice and hot shit so it's good and hot but not burning all right and they go I'm going to cook these for about three minutes on each side until they're nice and browned and while that's happening I'm going to soak the next slices of bread which is about the same amount of time three minutes it works out perfectly just like that this would be so good with hashbrowns turkey sausage and then a treat for the serve I think my husband's going to be thrilled so I'm going to serve the French toast with a drizzle of really good maple syrup and maybe a dusting of confectioner's sugar it would be good so these look like they're perfectly done I put them on a sheet pan put them in the oven
[Music] my friends coming for dinner on Friday night and I've got a really hectic week so I've got a plan I'm gonna make one thing every day and then by Friday all the cooking done and the table set here goes on Monday I'm making rosemary polenta which I'll just have to saute before the party Tuesday it's coconut macaroons would be great with coffee on Wednesday I'm testing recipes for my next book so I'll test a recipe for chicken with morels that I can serve on Friday Thursday I'll buy the ingredients for an arugula and parmesan salad and make the lemon vinaigrette and on Friday my friends will think I spent the entire day cooking and only you and I will know the truth one of the things I love the most about my garden is having fresh herbs there's something about just walking out the back door and just picking something the time will really last all winter so I can use it all year round but in the spring I planted this rose right but I'm serious it was about this big when I planted it I can't believe it's gotten so big rosemary is really great for especially for lamb but for today I'm gonna flavor my polenta with it I need about two branches so handy having it right out the back door [Music] so for my first dish for the week I'm gonna make polenta which is like a corn no pudding there are two kinds of planted this very soft polenta it has to be made just before you serve it and there's a firm polenta which you can make at least a week in advance so for my party I'm gonna make the one you can make in advance so the first thing on it I've done is I've heated a quarter of a pound of butter which is one stick and a quarter of a cup of olive oil and then I'm gonna put all kinds of flavorings into it teaspoon of rosemary right into the butter and oil one teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes give it a little heat and one tablespoon of freshly chopped garlic which I've already done here it's about three cloves so it's a lot of garlic but it's a lot of polenta also great I'm just gonna saute that for about a minute just to cook the garlic so while that's Aarti I'm just gonna add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper oh that smells great smell garlic and rosemary cook them together okay that's perfect now I'm gonna add three cups of chicken stock homais it's always better but if you don't have it you can use two canned chicken stock two cups of half-and-half good news is can sit in the fridge and you can just saute it up whenever you want to have it for dinner and now comes the base of polenta which is ground cornmeal it's yellow cornmeal I need two cups this is a nice stone ground cornmeal if you can find it but any good cornmeal is fine a medium grind if you have a choice okay that's two cups the nice 2 cup measure I'm just gonna sprinkle it in slowly while I'm whisking to make sure I don't have any lumps just keep sprinkling and whisking and this is gonna firm up really fast that's good okay now I'm just gonna cook it for a minute to until it gets thick just keep whisking it to get any lumps out just about like that Oh hard work okay off the heat I'm just gonna add about 1/2 a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese I would tell you is this okay gonna be so good so now I'm gonna pour it into a form so we're just gonna chill this and then the day the party cut it out in triangles or circles whatever I feel like okay and into the fridge one dish down for my party on Friday and I'm off to work [Music] [Applause] well we're going to have to decide which recipes we want to list on the website I'm good I could do that how about cheese straws great idea and of course it's got to be creme brulee right set it that's everything we're out of here all right I think we got a lot done today I think we accomplished a lot today so the next thing I'm gonna make my party on Friday are coconut macaroons it's sort of classic Jewish holiday thing made for Passover because it has no flour in it I make them all the time they're really great and won't believe how easy it is it's one bag 14 ounces of sweetened condensed milk it's one can and a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just fold these together until they're well mixed so the next thing I need is whipped egg whites into the mixer quarter of a teaspoon of salt the salt helps it whip okay that should do it so let me take them on a list they stand up just like that perfect so I'm just gonna lightly fold this into this coconut mixture and what this does is lighten it so it's not quite so dense okay that's all the ingredients so I'm just gonna fold this in you just want to do this carefully you don't want to deflate the egg whites we're gonna scoop them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper when we bake these at 325 for about 25 to 30 minutes and then after they cool I'm gonna put them in an airtight container and there's still gonna be fresh for the party on Friday how great is that into the oven and tomorrow I'm gonna make chicken morels for just the main course [Music] today's the day for testing recipes for my new book an addition to testing them over and over again to make sure I've got them right I'd like to road test them on my friends so I'm gonna make chicken with morels today and then I'm gonna serve it for my party on Friday night so I'm going to start with morels which these are dried morels from time to time you can find them fresh but dried morels are pretty available and they have this really sort of pungent woodsy flavor sort of like gym socks but they're really good so I'm gonna soak them in very very hot tap water for about 30 minutes and it's gonna reconstitute them okay while those are soaking I'm gonna start the chicken yeah six boneless chicken breasts and I'm gonna take some flour salt and pepper and just dust them before I saute them just mix it together I think we'll do three at a time that's what's gonna fit in the pan just cut them lightly that's good and messy so I'm just gonna pour a little bit of clarified butter in the pan and saute the chicken breasts just until they're browned on both sides for about eight to ten minutes total it's very important to heat the butter or oil in a pan first because then when the chicken hits you want to sear it so it really seals in the juices okay let's put the chicken breast right in coat them and then shake off the flour and while those are cooking up flour the other three chicken remember it's going in the oven later I'm gonna add the other three chicken breasts okay now I'm gonna drain them around let's not care for the slotted spoon for your fingers anyone okay chicken I think it's probably ready to turn okay shallot for the sauce perfectly okay this batch goes into the casserole and now I'm just gonna make the sauce about a third of a cup of showers by dinner better two cloves of garlic and the morels okay just I'll tell you that until the shallots are cooked and now what I'm going to do is add some Madeira and that's gonna do what's called deglazing the pan it's gonna get all those sort of brown bits from the chicken into the sauce that's gonna be totally delicious one cup of madeira Madeira is a Spanish wine that's like sherry and it's gonna flavor the sauce fabulously okay that's gonna cook for a little bit and now I'm gonna add eight ounces of creme fraiche which is a very thick French cream like sour cream but actually even thicker cup of heavy cream mix that into the sauce okay new two tablespoons of lemon juice and that's actually gonna cut sort of the sweetness of the richness of the cream and the creme fraiche it's a nice combination and teaspoon of salt 3/4 of teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna let that simmer for about 10 minutes until it's reduced and thickened [Music] while I'm working on a recipe I always think of notes I want to add to it just when I head to first one was that morels are wild mushrooms and they're dried you can find them especially a food store or by mail order and the second one is that creme fraiche sometimes you just can't find it sour cream is a great substitution okay that's done so smells amazing oh it's nicely reduced it's not thick it's just a little bit thickened and wonderful okay you pour it over the chicken oh I'm gonna get every single bit from that pan the morale was some shallots Madeira hmm that's wonderful so while he was on a bake this at 375 for about 12 minutes just until the chickens cooked it's gonna be really good on Friday night okay main course done tomorrow I'm gonna shop W Rugal and Parmesan for my salad [Music] so for tomorrow night's supper I want to make a salad I love a lemon vinaigrette I think maybe shaved parmesan on top of would be great but I need a lettuce that's gonna stand up to that these lettuces are beautiful these little bit lettuces but I think they're too delicate I needed a really strongly flavored lettuce and a romaine would be nice a little stronger but sort of classically Caesar salad let's see mescaline this will be great arugula it's peppery it's got a nice bite to it and it's a classic Italian combination with Parmesan that's what I'm gonna do it looks beautiful there are two types of really good Italian parmesan cheese Grana Padano and Reggiano I personally prefer the Reggiano it's really good and you can tell that it's Reggiano from the rind it's usually stamped Reggiano on the rind so buy a big chunk grate it yourself and it's gonna be wonderful on my arugula salad and love arugula it's got a nice peppery slightly bitter flavor I just think it's a great salad leaf and with a parmesan which actually is a little sweet that's a great contrast and lemon vinaigrette it's one of my favorites and I'm gonna spin them in my salad spinner my favorite tools just lift them out of the water you want to go near the sand that settles at the bottom salad seems like the thing you have to make up the last minute what do I like to do is get all the ingredients ready the vinaigrette the lettuce the parmesan and just throw it together just before I serve it I love the salad spinner now the thing about salad spinners it gets all the water off the lettuce so the vinaigrette clings better so it's a really important thing to do look how much water came out of that it's amazing so my secret is that I keep the arugula right in the salad spinner and it acts as a crisper in the refrigerator so into the refrigerator it would be perfect for tomorrow I'm gonna make the lemon vinaigrette I need quarter of a cup of lemon juice should be one or two lemons depending on the size [Music] [Applause] [Music] have a cup of olive oil 1/2 a teaspoon of salt [Music] quarter of a teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna whisk it up in this little mixing bowl that was so sweet of Michael to bring the flowers by I was so busy he also brought me Alka Miller which is this lime green some very fuzzy stuff which I love just keep working your way around cutting that stems and what I did here to make it easy for myself is really pick one color sort of lime green the flowers have a lot of yellow in it but they also have a lot of green and the best thing about this is it's really better for cut roses the day before because by tomorrow they're gonna open up and be really full it's a great thing to do ahead when you're having a dinner party okay so I'm nice modern black table so I thought I'd do a modern table setting very unusual for me so I've black bamboo mats and a white napkin with a little lime green dot to match the flowers pull it all together a fork for the main course and a salad fork it's going to put the salad fork on the outside done so I've got the food done I got the table setting done and it's gonna take no time to get rid of tomorrow and I'm gonna have to get apart oh what a day the good news is I've got everything almost done deep breath and I'm ready to go we hit the tipping rails I made this on Monday we put it fresh so it's nice and set cut these in triangles flour each one a little bit on the outside it's gonna make a really nice crust really like dust it off a little bit of heat so when the plan to head to the pan makes a nice crust so it's crisp on the outside and creamy inside and I'm gonna keep it warm in the oven until they're not just about ready to turn nice and brown they get and then onto the pan they want in the oven that's why I'm ready to serve dinner into the oven so this the lemon fresh lemon juice olive oil salt and pepper lightly put it on the center remember you can only put more vinaigrette on but not less and now just the parmesan a big slices of parmesan you can use a small knife but it's much harder I always find a special appeal or easier to do right on the time sounds all ready blend it and thickener in the oven after you want to start this hour yes okay so it's arugula with lemon vinaigrette and Parmesan for me all right I'm in charge of the chicken dr1 I think you need a little sausage thank you so it's polenta with parmesan Jesse you in charge of one I think I am would you like something a little French wine for a French chicken with him around how is it so far okay nobody wants dessert everybody did you mother used to make my 15 is for you got here
vinaigrettes hand so delicious that even the children will eat it so butter melted add about 4 cups of onions we're did it for about 10-15 minutes over medium flame until the onions are really cooked but they're not brown so let that go for a little while while again to finish ready so this is the secret of this dish frozen spinach is just as good as fresh so much easier so I've got five packages of frozen spinach which is about three pounds just squeeze all the water out of this just really squeeze it so you've got all the liquid asshole and then but just put it in a bowl that's done onions are just cooking they're not browning which is right and we're just gonna toss in quarter of a cup of flour and this is really only just have to cook for about a minute until the flour sift mr. Ross flowers at a better court of additionally an ethnic that makes sort of a classic me finishing can separate flavor so now I need a cup of heavy cream and two cups of milk and you know you really can make this book long milk but in special occasions everything goes great [Music] so that's probably going to take about five minutes for to heat up enough so if it starts four seconds something really thick it's not gluey it's just thickened great so the next thing is Parmesan cheese this is a chunk of Reggiano parmesan and it's really the best it's aged so it has great flavor but you can get grana you can get any kind of even Argentinian parmesan it's pretty good if you have a food processor it's a really easy way to do this but you can always do it with a box grater [Music] presto grated Parmesan so now I'm going to add half a cup of grated Parmesan it's a quarter cup measure so if it's doing tablespoon of kosher salt a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and the last ingredient spinach so I'm just going to break up the spinach and put it in and take it off the flame just mix the spinach in we take see how this all comes together much all this finishes and absorb all that wonderful sauce and that's why I take the water out because at this point it would be like soup if you didn't okay in front and the don't needs extra flavor I'm going to put an extra flavor on it I'm going to put about half a cup of grated Parmesan there's a little bit of great agree on top to the other about 375 for about 20 to 30 minutes so good finish graduation it looks good tastes good [Music] you
for dessert pecan squares dipped in warm chocolate so the first thing I do is one in a quarter of tons of butter 3/4 of a cup of sugar it's really just like making shortbread I'm just going to cream that for about 3 minutes until it's light and fluffy as I turn it on low just enough to mix it we really want to start with room-temperature butter otherwise it really won't scream well okay the next thing is three eggs and now resource a teaspoon of vanilla and then while that's mixing I want to combine the flour baking powder and salt so I need four and a half cups of flour 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt and just missed it all together put the flour mixture into the butter mixture he's a great for a party or for a picnic because you can make them in advance and they transport really well I'm going to dip them in chocolate to make them even better okay that's the crunch the sheep in and patted out with my hem hundred and fifty degrees for 15 minutes and the crust it's set but not brown so the shortbread base is cooled and set and the next thing I have to do for my pecan bars is the filling needs just a little more butter one pound I'm going to turn it on if I want to melt it next thing is brown sugar brown sugar is granulated sugar and molasses mixed together and one pound is two and a quarter cup I need three cups all together and then that's recorded attached and the last thing is one cup of honey this is really just a filling for the pecans to hold them all together perfect so we're going to do is just stir it all together and melt it and then we're going to turn the heat up high and boil it for about three minutes so it really caramelizes it okay while that's heating I'm going to add two vents so that a teaspoon of lemon zest put that right in the teaspoon of our incense okay when I come to boil to boil it for about three minutes and it'll get really syrupy and sick we do a quarter cup of heavy cream [Music] and 2 pounds of pecans these delicious shortbread crust support this whole thing right on top one thing I learned is sometimes there's bubbles over a little in the oven so I put a piece of aluminum foil on the bottom of the oven floor it's certainly easier to throw away the aluminum foil and it is to clean the oven and just spread it all out come on solution okay all done so into the oven 350 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes until they've set and when they're cool in a dip them in chocolate those are good dip it right in just the edge you know what the whole time how's that
I have to say I make a mean guacamole I'll show you how so take for ripe Hass avocados those are the ones that are brown on the outside when they're ripe cut each one in half and then I use a knife just to get the seed out be careful you don't get your hand usually guacamole is a puree of avocados it doesn't have a lot of flavor I think it's got to have great flavor and really chunky texture these are perfectly ripe you want them so they're bright green if they're too ripe they turn brown inside it's not good then immediately at three tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice just to stop the avocado from browning there all these theories about how to keep guacamole from turning brown but forget them all it's really simple fresh lemon juice one lemon should do it eight dashes of Tabasco sauce which gives Baucom only a really spicy kick I like it really spicy you can decide how hot you want yours 1/2 a cup of small diced red onion and a minced clove of garlic then a teaspoon of kosher salt that's the same as black pepper and just toss everything together then using a sharp knife slice through the avocados into the finely diced this is the secret to really good guacamole it mixes all the ingredients together and it stays really chunky this way finally at a medium tomato that's been seated and small diced it's seated so it doesn't make the guacamole watery I put the tomatoes in last because I don't want them to change the color of the guacamole toss everything together and you've got great easy guacamole
[Music] for years and years and years every time Jeffrey came home on Friday nights I would make birth chicken and then one day I got to be a little more creative from this want the house to smell great and of course I want to make chicken so each time I challenge myself to make something new I'm making chicken piccata which is wonderful when it start with two chicken breasts and when do a coating for them so they're sauteed and a lemon and butter sauce are so good so the first thing I need is 1/2 a cup of flour it's all for this flour Pepa teaspoon of salt 1/4 of a teaspoon of pepper and mix that all together that's the first part of the coating and it can be dipped into one egg just mix with a little touch of water put it all together the next part of the coating is bread crumbs you seasoned bread crumbs that's recorded in the cup okay a little oil in the pan just a few tablespoons and while that guests time I'm going to take the chicken breast [Music] just on the net so they get really thin chicken breast this or thicker parts and the senator and other parts and the sway the cook more evenly and they cook really quickly roll into the good Vassar some people have need pounding things but everybody has a rolling pin I like them between a quarter and a half inch thick and just do it in two directions so it ends up smooth doesn't in them and ridges okay so the first one goes into the flour just make sure it's coated all over shake off the excess into the egg and the flour drives it out and then the eggs make it so that's a break consulate here and then we're using drive break rub right in just two minutes on each side until it's golden brown [Music] okay that guy's done perfect you have a next one royal right it's it man two minutes on each side one of these replace Geoffrey's favorite roast chicken for Friday night chicken dinner [Music] perfectly done okay I put this on the sheet pan keep it warm in the oven 400 degrees for about 10 minutes right alongside the red onion and then I'm going to make a nice lemon butter sauce to go with it Oh perfect timing I just heard Jeffrey the weekend starts now typical stairs changing the red onions are roasting in the oven but erm of mashed potatoes are done and now I just have to make the sauce for the chicken piccata so first I'm going to do is just wipe out this pan that I cook the chicken in and I'm just going to heat up tablespoon of butter [Music] the chicken is warm in the oven is to be warm in the oven I just make a nice sauce for it okay now I need third cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice probably two lemon to pour it right into this butter okay now tech cup of white wine really nice dry white wine and something I drink for dinner okay half a teaspoon of salt quarter the piece for the pepper and this is what I'm going to do with the limit right in the top to get the flavor of the vet took comes together yeah the best eight bits a minute while I travel to far places like Lima some chicken for the onions a little bit of vinaigrette left over on the marinating each I always like to put on the end toss them all together it's just so good to do wonderful okay them chicken [Music] to the cottage saw slices of lemon significance lemons become a little bit of parsley Jerusalem is also good and love the way they look [Music] who doesn't love master tailor but erm of mashed potatoes your timing is perfect as always guess what's for dinner let's see it's Friday if you think you chicken but what kind of chicken is chicken piccata and it's right sister the physics is it up there with a roast chicken you know I used to think that roast chicken was the only thing I could have on Friday night but this chicken piccata this is just this day
[Music] I write an entertaining column for House Beautiful magazine and I've invited the top brass for dinner tonight including the editor-in-chief Steven Drucker who as luck would have it is one of my dearest friends now this is a design magazine so I think not only the dinner but also the setting should be pretty wonderful wouldn't want to disappoint the boss instead of the usual filet of beef dinner that they're probably expecting I'm making Stephens favorite comfort food spaghetti and meatballs on the side really good garlic bread made with ciabatta olive oil and lots of garlic and for dessert something fun ice cream sodas with homemade chocolate and raspberry sauce I'm gonna do everything I can to dazzle this crowd but most of all I want them to go home saying wasn't that fun just when people are expecting a really fancy over-the-top dessert it's just when I like to Surprise them and do something really earthy and so I'm gonna make ice cream sodas I'm gonna make two sauces chocolate sauce and fresh raspberry sauce so for the fresh raspberry sauce I've got two packets of fresh raspberries that have a nice each have a cup of sugar this is so easy won't believe it and the juice of one lemon this relates to sort of dessert and everybody remembers from their childhood and they go crazy when they know they're gonna have them for dessert so the juice of one lemon and lemon doesn't have to sit in the refrigerator and the juices from the raspberries are gonna come out and if we make a syrup really good in ice cream sodas now how easy was that [Music] so the next thing I want to make for ice-cream service is chocolate sauce it's a little harder than making raspberry sauce but not a lot the first thing is 3/4 of a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder I actually save it because sometimes it gets a little lumpy in the container okay I just just make sure it's smooth it smells good already chocolate sauce who wouldn't want this in their ice-cream soda okay into a pan okay why don't half cups of sugar pinch of salt one cup of water half a teaspoon of instant coffee really makes chocolate taste like chocolate it's gonna stir this up and simmer for about five minutes so this is what we're gonna do for dessert everybody's gonna have an ice-cream soda glass they can choose chocolate sauce or raspberry sauce a little bit of milk in the bottom of the glass fill it with club soda so we'll have either chocolate soda or raspberry soda and then lots of choices of ice cream it's most delicious that's perfect okay this is done before into the glass gorgeous lip service your left I'm gonna add is a little vanilla I didn't put it into the original mix of 71 for the flavor to be evaporated while I cook it so one teaspoon of good vanilla just stir it in and I guess let me chop this sauce for our ice cream sodas so the last thing I have to do is sieve the raspberry sauce sorry marinated ladies lemon juice and sugar and now I'm just going to sieve them end up with raspberry syrup so the other surprise I have for tonight in addition to ice cream sodas as I'm making Stephan his absolutely favorite meal its meatballs and spaghetti just when he thinks I'm gonna be serving something fancy like filet of beef I'm just gonna make meatballs in spaghetti can't wait to see the look on his face so I'm just gonna push this through a little bit take the seeds out and a lot of the pulp but just sort of squeeze a lot of the juice out to make a really good syrup that should be it yeah let's see how this is mmm-hmm a really intense raspberry flavor it's gonna be so good in the ice cream sodas so now I'm off to get some things for another pasta to serve with drinks [Music] I'm a few rules for easy entertaining and one of the most important is I never make more than two things so I thought with drinks maybe I'm gonna serve a big as opposed to a platter actually like to do it under passed a platter because just by a few ingredients everybody uses their fingers and it's really easy I don't cook anything hi Deb good morning this looks gorgeous I know I like the oil-cured olives I love the mixed ones but I think the black ones will look better on the platter it's nice to have big blocks of color so I'm just going to choose the solid black ones perfect and then what's the difference in the artichokes these here are the imported artichokes okay that's what I'll take how's that great same size same size would be wonderful they're wonderful they still have the stems on them and it's delicious maybe some big chunk of parmesan and some salami is to go on the platter [Music] in about a quarter of a pound perfect the most wonderful platter [Music] what could possibly be more earthly to serve a fancy crowd than spaghetti and meatballs but they'll be surprised so I'm gonna start with three different kinds of meat have a pound of pork have a pound of veal and a pound of ground beef so these are all ground up fresh that's the meat and then I'm gonna add a cup of fresh breadcrumbs this is about four slices of bread I took the crusts off and just grind it up on the food processor a quarter cup of dry breadcrumbs actually use fresh breadcrumbs to keep them moist and dry bread crumbs to hold them together when I'm cooking them and fresh parsley about two tablespoons okay so I'm just gonna strip the leaves off I always love to surprise people for dinner I would say the last thing they're expecting is spaghetti and meatballs and just because it's beginning me post doesn't mean it doesn't have to be really fabulous okay so two tablespoons of freshly minced parsley the next thing is Parmesan cheese and I'll show you how I do it really quickly turn it on it's really noisy how fast is that I need about a half a cup of grated Parmesan cheese i think it's unusual and meatballs but i think gives it lots of flavor one egg all these ingredients are just on to either flavor it or hold it together so I'm just gonna plate it a little bit pour it on top now some seasoning a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg 2 teaspoons of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper and here's the surprising part warm water 3/4 of a cup I sure learned this trick from Rao's that famous Italian restaurant in New York and it keeps the meatballs so moist you wouldn't believe it ok clean hands cooks best tool and you want to do this really lightly you don't want to sort of compact it you want to fluff it up and still mix them together oh this smells so good it's gonna make about 16 really good size meatballs just perfect for my guess [Music] a quarter inch of oil olive oil and vegetable oil let's go to saute these I just keep turning them so they Brown evenly on all sides I'm doing them in two batches so I don't want to overcrowd them so they're brown nicely [Music] okay that's eight done maybe would it do [Music] it right into the oil for about ten minutes and with and browned on the outside I don't need to be fully cooked inside it doesn't little cook them in tomato sauce later in the meantime so let me get everything together my tomato sauce [Music] so the second batch of Meatballs you've done just ten minutes until they're nice and brown and I'm gonna finish cooking with a tomato sauce okay I'm just gonna pour off all the oil that I used for cooking the meatballs so I'm gonna use the same pan it's got all that great flavor from the meatballs a little bit of fresh olive oil 1 cup of onions it's one or two onions depending on how big they are and they're gonna cook for 10 minutes until they're really tender and flavorful and now I need some wine for the sauce [Music] okay one and a half teaspoons of garlic I do the garlic at the end because it burns really quickly garlic immediately it's wonderful okay you have a couple of red wine deglaze the pan get all those really crusty bits from the meatballs really flavors the sauce and leave the pan to one 28-ounce can of fresh tomatoes yeah okay that's nice great better tablespoon parsley we're gonna have two spoons of salt one and a half teaspoons of pepper we're gonna put that together for a minute okay so now what I'm gonna do is take the meatballs and just put them right back into the sauce and they're gonna cook for about 25 to 30 minutes okay put them all in oh who could resist this looks so good so these are gonna cook for about 25 to 30 minutes until the meatballs are cooked and the sauce is thickened and in the meantime you gotta have garlic bread so I'm gonna do it with a twist meatballs and spaghetti gotta have girl with bread someone cooked the garlic first I'm gonna have a cup of olive oil and then lots of girl so it's chopped up six cloves of garlic really roughly gonna do this really fast in the food processor quarter cup of fresh parsley in the same way that I like to surprise people and make something earthy when they're expecting something fancy there's nothing more earth as it garlic Breton so we're gonna make a little fancier making it with Giovanna or just a wonderful Italian bread and I've got fresh oregano which is a rare treat but it's really wonderful I've got an eighth of a cup just put it right in 20 spoon of salt half teaspoon of pepper I'm stoked pirata of course you can do this by hand but it's so much quicker in the food processor okay love the smell of that I'm just gonna put it into the hot oil and just cook it for about 30 seconds really fast don't want to do is let the garlic [Music] okay that's good just enough to cook the garlic that's not wrong okay for the bread and just spoon this gorgeous garlic and herb mixture over it [Music] and the other side it whispers just a little bit of butter and then I'm gonna wrap it in foil put it in the oven 350 degrees for about five minutes then take the foil off and let it get really nice and crisp well okay into the oven the whole house is gonna smell like garlic and herbs if that doesn't impress the boss I don't know what will and now I'm gonna do the table every Italian table has water and wine right on the table but they don't know is this the ice-cream service well the dinner is Italian and the meal is one of Stephens favorite dinners now we usually serve to your boss I'll give you a hint does oregano in it we like oregano but what do you think stay right here I'll be right back spaghetti I have a couple of rules about making spaghetti any kind of prostatic big pot of water lots of salt and I'm just put it right in six people about time didn't have a pasta yeah okay splash of oil to make sure the pasta doesn't stick it's gonna cook for about ten minutes in the meantime I smelled garlic bread now it's nice and hot crisp big shocks [Music] I can really smell it garlic in the herbs and the fresh oregano it's right onto the table does not record just I love the way that works on all the green herbs [Music] okay I think pastas just about ready [Music] nice tomato sauce and meatballs hey bunch of basil right in the middle big spoons can't wait to see their faces [Music] okay it's meatballs and skinny [Music] [Laughter] [Music] to all the bosses so you think this is missing quite easy dessert I'll be right back [Music] they thought people spaghetti with someone do-it-yourselfers come sodas are even better chocolate sauce it's dangerous I just it's ready okay everybody ice cream sodas for dessert how's that for unlikely Farber your first would you like chocolate raspberry sauce chocolate of course of course how silly of me okay so it's chocolate sauce and now I have vanilla strawberry chocolate and espresso this espresso you don't even I don't have to go beyond just press out okay espresso ice cream with real espresso how's that I want the vanilla okay that's it right out of New York all right chocolate all around okay you got it I can do that too oh really miss isn't that the way they always are [Laughter]
[Music] everybody needs to know how to make a roast chicken even my friend Susan Stroman so I'm going to show her how to do a really easy roast chicken I didn't get lots of flavor that's beautiful how's that for a chicken the first thing I do actually is I salt it in advance when it comes home from the store I put the salted put it in the fridge and all that salt gets into the meat so it gives it lots of flavor okay I'm going to salt and pepper the inside you're taking goodness I am on the inside now what kind of salt do you use actually is kosher salt which i think is a little softer than table salt okay so you know those big boxes you can find in the grocery store salt and pepper the inside it's all about getting flavor into it okay so going to take a head of garlic a whole head of garlic don't peel it don't do anything I'll just cut the whole thing right in half and it goes right on the inside and I think a lemon really does a lot for it and we cut it in quarters and just shove that little lemon in there so you tie up its little legs just like that so that keeps it close to the body okay and then what I do is just tuck the wings under itself instead of tying it up like the chickens in bondage it's just so much easier to just do that oh one of the key things is you want to make sure the pants are too big because if it's too big the vegetables in the pan are going to burn so first I'm going to put in the pan is onions okay carrots into the pan for carrots and the last thing is potatoes and I love these Yukon Gold potatoes and now my chicken so it's a five to six pan chicken it serves three people probably people and now in order for the chicken to Brown really important you want to dry it okay paper towel just going to go wash my hands and I'll show you the next part I don't have any fun until I get that I will wait okay little butter just going to brush the outside of the skin and what does better really do labor flavors it but also the milk solids in the butter actually burn a little bit so that actually Browns the chicken it looks and there is a little bit on the potatoes and onions and the carrots just mix it up a little bit lots of salt and pepper on the chicken and on the vegetables and that's it so into the oven 425 degrees okay so between an hour and 15 an hour 30 minutes and take the chicken out and cover it with aluminum foil I take the vegetables in the pan and put it right back in the oven for 15 minutes let them keep cooking right and that way the juices and the chicken get back into the meat and it's unbelievable how different it is then what happens then we have to carve it how's that for a chicken that's it is long
[Music] okay I'll pick you up at 6:30 can't wait to see you bye that was my friend Frank he thinks regarding to dinner at a restaurant but I'm gonna surprise everyone have dinner at the beach I even have a surprise guest I just love surprises my beach party I'm gonna make a spa Cho fillet beef sandwiches marinated grilled shrimp and for dessert my outrageous brownies so first of the filet of beef I'm just gonna roast this by spreading the outside with butter keeps it really moist and then lots of salt and pepper I know it seems like a lot but it really makes a difference I'm gonna roasted at 500 degrees make sure your ovens really clean for about 25 minutes and then I'm gonna make sandwiches with blue cheese sauce and arugula it's so good so next for gazpacho which is a cold soup that's like a liquid salad it's really good I'll show you how easy this is it says all kinds of salad ingredients and I'm just gonna chop them up really fine in the food processor start with 1 hothouse cucumber don't want to puree it cuz I want this to have lots of great texture and I do the most separately because I want them all to be finely chopped enough pureed and then for some Tomatoes yeah okay and it's the ball red onion so nice and chunky not too fine so it has wonderful texture I bear for contestant one time I was behind the counter and somebody came to me and asked Frigga stop Oh sue I was a little confused for a minute nope but I figured out they wanted to kiss Pancho and two peppers okay that's all the vegetables and then I need three cups of good tomato juice and like a salad it has olive oil and vinegar so quarter of a cup of vinegar a cup of olive oil half a tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper the last ingredients of chopped garlic three cloves of chopped garlic right in and all I have to do is mix it all together it's delicious it's colorful it's good for you how bad can that be I'm still let it sit in the refrigerator on what the flavors get really melded that's so good [Music] maybe should be done oh that's great I'm just gonna let it rest for about 20 minutes under aluminum foil and it'll finish cooking [Music] knock of a blue cheese sauce [Music] I love blue cheese sauce for filet of beef so why not for sandwiches so I have Bluto there and I need a creamy blue cheese but you can use any other kind you like like gorgonzola or if you'd like Maytag blue cheese from Wisconsin it's really good so I'm just gonna mash this up with a fork this is really easy blue cheese sauce you can throw together and you can use it for hot filet beef if you want to also okay and then I'm gonna add 2/3 of a cup of sour cream 1/3 of a cup of mayonnaise this is a really fast blue cheese sauce why don't have teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of pepper that's it we're just gonna mash it up together what I like about this is it is sandwiches but it's sort of best of class so that's it so now for the flavor I need to take the strings off first and slice it I'm just gonna slice it as thinly as I can no this is beautiful okay now I'm gonna assemble the sandwiches okay big dollop of blue cheese sauce on one side some beef no these look good some arugula arugula is great cuz it's peppery and it goes really well with the filet of beef Rula and then just a tiny bit of butter on the other side of the bread so it doesn't dry it out just like that yeah it doesn't I'm gonna wrap each sandwich with a little bit of parchment paper so everybody gets their own sandwich at the beach that's a really special sandwich I'm having a beach party with lots of surprises a surprise guest a surprise place and for dessert I'm gonna surprise everybody with my outrageous brownies [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay six eggs and then because chocolate is really enhanced by the flavor of coffee I put in three tablespoons of coffee granules I prepared coffee but instant coffee granules for lots of flavor two tablespoons of good vanilla and two and a quarter cups of sugar this makes a lot of brownies it's gonna whisk that all together one of the good things about these brownies is they really need to be cooled and chilled in the refrigerator so you can make them up to a week in advance so it's a great thing for parties so in here I've melted and cooled six ounces of unsweetened chocolate a pound of butter and a pound of semi-sweet chocolate I'm just gonna pour it into the egg mixture it's a lot of chocolate but it makes a lot of brownies okay just mix that together how chocolate is that okay next the flour this recipe doesn't have a lot of flour which is why they're so fudgy so I need 1 cup of flour 1 tablespoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt we sift these together it mixes it but it also makes sure there's nothing in the flour that you don't want in your brownies and now this mixture goes into the chocolate mixture just fold it in so my surprise guest is my friend Kathryn Ireland who's an incredible interior designer and she offered to do the table setting who wouldn't say yes so she's at the beach doing this wonderful table setting I'm sure I can't wait to see it and now as though it's not chocolaty enough I'm gonna have chocolate chips and walnuts I've got 12 ounces of chocolate chips and three cups of walnuts and I'm just going to add some flour to it so they don't sink to the bottom of the batter oh right in Oh I'm just gonna follow these in so the Brandis are gonna bake at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes and in the middle of the baking because air builds up between the brownies in the pan and just pick up the pen and wrap it on the baking rack and it just releases all that air so 350 degrees 35 minutes and halfway through wrap it on the baking rack so half sheet pan 13 by 18 by one and a half inches floured and buttered well buttered and floured just smooth [Music] now who wouldn't want those for dessert into the other [Music] not much further I think I think what about about here what do you think [Music] I think about you know come on actually what about this just a bit further up [Music] thank you guys thanks so much bye-bye [Music] perfect [Music] [Music] hello how's it going the tables up the cloth is on so far so good how are you doing oh I'm great I'm so busy cooking well what are we having I'm making Browning's avocado salad and shrimp that

them now and then my friends and I are gonna grill them at the beach so for the marinade I'm just gonna chop up one small yellow onion it's a really good marinade it's got lots of fresh herbs and lots of mustard and three mince cloves of garlic lots of garlic teaspoon of dry mustard 2 teaspoons of prepared mustard 2 teaspoons of salt this makes a lot of marinade half a teaspoon of cracked pepper the juice of a lemon in a quarter of a cup of olive oil so that's the marinade and I'm going to add the shrimp in the herbs we toss them all in then I left the tails on and then lots of fresh herbs I've got parsley and basil I've got a quarter of a cup of chopped parsley and a quarter of a cup of chopped basil just big rough chop okay that's the parsley and then fresh basil just chop it up rough with you that's it just mix it all up let's go boys sit in the refrigerator even overnight the more it sits the more flavor the shrimp pass it'll be so delicious and fun at the beach last thing to do for my beach party is uneven avocado salad the key to this salad is to use Hass avocados they're the ones that are brown on the outside not those bright green ones these have so much more flavor and great texture and this is a quick way to take it out just run your finger around the outside and it just pops right out you can do it with a spoon but this is so much easier and so much Messier so three avocados and then I'm gonna use three heads of and Eve we want to do is just do big cubes of avocados into the bowl and then three heads of and Eve for the on deep I'm just gonna take off the core at the end and then just do big slices like this and when it goes into the bowl just pull the leaves apart and Eve it's really delicious it's a salad green that's a little bit bitter and it's great with the sweetness of the avocado this looks great I love the colors I like the light green and dark green and after the lemon vinaigrette a quarter cup of lemon juice quarter cup of olive oil why don't have tablespoons of mustard good Dijon mustard because it's just full of salt and a half a teaspoon of pepper that's pretty easy just whisk it all together it's actually great vinaigrette for anything even just a non beef salad the avocados make it particularly good okay I'm just gonna pour it over the salad let's toss it all together bet it tastes great the and Eve is a little bit bitter avocado is really sweet and the spicy mustard it's a great combination and that's gonna be delicious no picnics [Music] okay now all I have to do is pack up all my food for the beach that's great chunky and got lots of flavor smell the garlic into the bag next thing is filet of beef and blue cheese sandwiches right in the bags next the avocado not a salad just good lemony mustard vinaigrette marinated grilled shrimp gonna cook them at the beach lots of onion lots of garlic very good and now the Browns [Music] this is gonna go into Chinese takeout containers they're great for packing things to the beach good rows a big delicious the bag the shrimp in and the one thing everybody always forgets a corkscrew I'm ready to go pick up Frank and Steven gosh I know be here any second let the fun begin my friends Frank and Stephen think we're going out for dinner huh I'm gonna Surprise them with a fabulous picnic on the beach it's gonna be really fun [Music] so where we going we go anywhere with you you know that is this a new way to the restaurant Maya now the restaurants in the other direction we're heading towards the beach we're going value the beach [Music] [Laughter] on the beach I don't know about you but I need a cocktail you've been working hard I brought a nice rosy this man Rosa it's got a little usually everything I make starts with a pound of butter nice and hard for you what's the secret to getting it off twist that's twisted skewer twisting usually right yourself in the process it's um lemon juice olive oil it's really simple but it's Nava cotta when it's really ripe has great flavor surprise desserts for everyone outrageous brownies that one's got your name on it is david frank and maybe one for me too I'm Haven - you know I really did actually so what are we doing tomorrow
[Music] Lemmon capellini is just about the fastest weeknight costume you can make and one of the reasons is because capellini so thin it cooks in two to three minutes so I've got one pound of capellini I'm going to put it in a big pot of boiling salted water and the amazing thing is the sauce doesn't take much more going to make its lemons and butter so first thing I need is a half a pound of butter I know I know it's a lot of butter but after a bad day it works so it's good two lemons I need the zest and the juice so I just want to get that very very thin yellow part of the lemon and remember you always want to desc them before you choose them I'm going to do a second lemon this pastas really versatile you can either serve it with a little shrimp or chicken or if you've had a really bad day at the office you can just have it all by itself it's a lot of lemon zest but you really want a lot of flavor lemon zest right into the butter I'm in the juice of both lemons I love my little juicer so fast you definitely want to use fresh lemon juice I'm not a big fan of anything but fresh lemon juice I always have that like awful metallic flavor even if you juice lemons in advance like a day or two and maybe the fridge which wouldn't fit decided okay this goes right into the pan with the butter and the lemon zest 1 teaspoon of salt once you sort of pepper just swirl it around if the task is done and this is the key to the whole thing instead of draining the water what I'm going to do is take the pasta and put it right into the sauce and then it's going to cook them the sauce first so just about a minute or two and it's going to serve all the butter and the lemon but don't try out the pasta water because actually if the sauce gets a little too thick and always take a little of the pasta water protestin starch in it and send it out a little bit toss it all together so all the lemon and the butter and the zest and all the seasonings get all mixed in well it's a weeknight and it's just about dinnertime I just want to make sure this is really good so I wanted to be one serving like this and I think it needs a little lemon zest on top I would say weeknight dinner doesn't get any easier than this or for delicious you
so for lunch with Marisa and Pam I'll make one of my favorite soups it's called borscht and it's a beet soup it's a nice summer dish and what I've done is I've cooked the beets about 35 to 40 minutes until they're really tender and I saved the cooking liquid and that's when I'm going to start the soup with I cooked about two pounds of beets the first thing is one and a half cups of beef cooking liquid I'm going to start the soup so there's also a winter borscht which is like a beef stew with vegetables but they're all basically Russian peasant food since I was originally a Russian peasant perfect okay why don't they have cups of beef cooking liquid two cups of chicken stock if I'm a chicken sex always better but if not he's a good hand 116 ounces of sour cream half a cup of yogurt sort of a cup of sugar bring out the sweetness of the beads fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons perfect 2 teaspoons of vinegar or champagne vinegar tablespoon salt that's a lot of borscht one and a half teaspoons of pepper and a whisk this all together it's a wonderful cold soup and the good news is you can just sit in the refrigerator for days just serve it whenever you want to it's gonna be ready when you are okay now lots of fresh vegetables one chopped cucumber the most force is really kind of pureed but I'm going to make a really chunky vegetable soup I can have a cup of scallions chopped give it a little heat 2 tablespoons of fresh dill okay that's good and the last thing of the beef so hands are going to really read and biddies but the only way to do it so the beets I just cooked in boiling salted water for about 35 to 45 minutes until they're done and then I just cool them peel them and save the cooking liquid no beets are really available to year-round I've made this what can be - that's fine but if you can get fresh beets it's even better now it's beginning to look like borscht nice red ham it's gonna be gorgeous I'd love to serve it in a white mug dollop of sour cream some fresh dill it's going to be really delicious cold soup okay into the fridge be going to wash my hands and I'm going to go off shopping [Music] so the borscht is nice chilled so it's got great flavor with beets and cucumbers lots of dill and I'm putting it in a cup because I thought it'd be so much easier for a business lunch not to have a big bowl of soup I thought that sour cream never heard and put a little sprig of fresh dill on top and lunch is ready
[Music] so to the beach can be tricky sometimes you want something is really easy to eat that can be served at room temperature my assistant Barbara and I are going to the beach and I'm going to take panzanella which she loved and I think I'll serve it was Chinese takeout containers first thing we do is heat up some oil and then took break soup in it Italians made up that's galaxies leftover bread so it's a great way to use it if it's a little bit dry even better really soaks up the vinaigrette sink check the first time Barbara and I tested this recipe we we decided any salad that has bread cubes dipped in vinaigrette was just fine with us I think we actually ate around the vegetable okay oils hot sauce in the bread cubes love salt and tell them around their hole a little bit of oil and while those toasts I'm gonna make a nice garlic vinaigrette for the salad can't make garlic vinaigrette with that one clove of garlic I need a bad teaspoon it should be just right okay so about a teaspoon of garlic right into the bowl half a teaspoon of good Dijon mustard three tablespoons of I use champagne vinegar you can use any good white wine vinegar as a cup of good olive oil most we will actually multiply the vinaigrette which is nice I have two teaspoons install quarter teaspoon of pepper and that's the vinaigrette so next is getting vegetables ready the first thing is the cucumber I really like see those cucumbers they're called English or hothouse cucumbers cut off the ends cut it in half and then with a small spoon or tea so just take out the seeds it's called seedless but it has a few seeds with so much less bitter than regular American cucumbers it's just really nice right down the middle boom or this a really chunky so you don't want it finely chopped so I already have red peppers yellow peppers and red onions thinly sliced I got chunky cucumbers just going to make a lot of salad and the longer it sits the better it tastes okay that's the cucumbers got tomatoes these are good Israeli tomatoes so big chunky slices of tomato it's a really casual salad okay so into evolved [Music] microwave so colorful okay I'm going to add some capers about three tablespoons fresh basil okay half of the good part croutons perfectly toasted great warm crouton vinaigrette so good on croutons we live in a great are so good together in the vegetable basil capers that's going to be really good at the beach

having parmesan chicken broccoli with bowties ice cream sundaes and chocolate truffles truffles are easier than you think they are it's basically cream which I've got nice and hot now and lots of chocolate which I'm going to chop up really fine so I've got a half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate and a half a pound of bitter chocolate the reason why I use both of them is because I think bittersweet chocolates a little too bitter and semi-sweet chocolates a little too sweet so I combine them to get the best of both worlds so I'm just gonna chop this up really finely that's good I'm gonna put it all in a big bowl what smells good already and then I'm gonna take the hot cream that just boiled I pour it through a sieve just to make sure you know sometimes you get a little bit of a skin on the top and you don't want that to happen and then a whisk and just stir it slowly until the hot cream melts the chocolate so I'm gonna make this mixture let it sit until it gets firm and then make little balls out of it and roll it in cocoa powder and confectioner sugar so good I love when it gets really shiny and it's doing that okay that's great nice and smooth so I'm gonna put in a little bit of vanilla got a half a teaspoon a really important ingredient for chocolate is coffee I'll show you for some reason coffee really brings out the flavour in chocolate so I'm just gonna add about a tablespoon of hot brewed coffee you won't really taste it but it'll make a huge difference in how the chocolate tastes when I can smell it when the hot coffee hits the chocolate it smells so good great that's perfect this is just gonna sit here for about an hour until it gets nice and firm in the meantime I'm gonna shopping for more sweets for my party years ago the African test I started filling these bags with candy I thought the kids would like them you and I know who's eating them on their way home so for my party I think that'd be great toppings for ice cream and gift bag for people on the way home lots of colors lots of flavors it's gonna be really fun ice-cream sundaes I'd like to do a few unusual flavors like raspberry sounds so delicious but I still need the classics chocolate and vanilla I have kids coming for dinner and we know what finicky eaters they can be so I thought I would make broccoli but I'm gonna put in bowtie pasta so they'll eat it so I'm going to start with a little bit of butter and olive oil to make the sauce the butter is for the flavor and the olive oil is because it has a higher burning temperature this is gonna be so good with Parmesan chicken so I'm gonna add chopped garlic and then I'm gonna make a lemon and garlic sauce for it and then at the end throw in Parmesan cheese and pignoli so it's got lots of flavor okay right into the pan with the garlic meanwhile I'm gonna zest it lemon this is a great zester because it actually has strips of lemon zest rather than a grater and that way the lemon zest gets cooked into the sauce and you can actually even see it in the dish which I like if it's going to taste like lemon I think it should look like lemons and I do it right over the pan so I get the oil you can see the oil from the lemon right into the sauce just I take the garlic for a minute until it's cooked so now I want the juice in it it's a really simple dish and it uses a really fresh ingredients so it's actually even good for you okay a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and the sauce is ready oh it smells garlicky and lemony it's gonna be wonderful so I've got bowtie pasta all cooked and I blanched some broccoli for a few minutes until it was like nice and green and then pour over the sauce right onto it just want to make sure I get all of it two teaspoons of salt about a half a teaspoon of pepper looks good and then when I had two more things grated Parmesan cheese that I graded and left in the fridge and the last thing is from your only nuts I sauteed something you always until they're just sort of brown and nutty they just taste so much better when they're a little browned and crisp right on the top just toss it all together mmm mister which is fresh from the lemon juice and it has the spiciness of the parmesan this gonna be really good for my party my friends are coming soon and I just want to finish the truck of truffles before they get here so this is a mixture of chocolate and cream perfect with a little vanilla and coffee to give it lots of flavor so to scoop these out most people use two spoons but I find a melon baller really works perfectly well just dip it in really hot water and then it'll come out perfectly great now comes the really messy part I'm going to dip some of them in powdered sugar just like that and some of them in cocoa powder these are so good they're pretty easy to make the named truffles really comes from a savory thing it's like the mushrooms that are dug up with pigs but these chocolate truffles supposed to be really rough like those mushrooms that are dug up so you don't want perfect little boss you don't want to sort of messy little things that are incredibly delicious inside what they should do is just melt in your mouth and these really will before I do the powdered sugar but it wash my hands otherwise all the mess so my party today is kids in the candy store I just thought it'd be really fun to have children's food that even grown-ups love so my friends are bringing their children we're absolutely adorable and we're going to have Parmesan chicken and broccoli with bow ties and ice cream sundaes we can all act like children oh I think my friends are here perfect timing I'm so glad to know you I got my hands in powdered sugar from the truffles nobody wants which I touch it with okay a little cooking so what would you guys like to do we go to the beach yeah what that sounds like that's it for today okay Kim I want to see what's in that bag I look really excited people see you later all right bye okay great first what's this well we have licorice our life rabbits are cool let's tie the napkin to a great idea of fabulous your bubble gum tree a little bit of bubble gum you know my girls they love bubble gum and when I have some really terrific Patties oh they're so cool those fun yeah I'm definitely wearing a hat okay candy dots oh great bring back all the memories eat something the best and some chocolate lots of chocolate coins fantastic how do ass lollipops integrate our welcome I love them so why don't I set the table and surprise you with the other goodies in event ask Iran okay I'm gonna finish dinner okay see ya but my friend Kim is the perfect person to do the table she runs EA T gifts which is the most incredible children's store in the city and she's bought wonderful goodies for everybody fruit juice shapes it's a really easy way to get fruit to us and for your kids what it is is a combination of really good juice and gelatin and the kids can pick it up in their hands it's really fun so I have four cups of fruit juice I'm using grape juice cuz kids love Concord grape juice three cups into the pan which I'm going to heat up and one cup into the bowl and then mix in four packages of gelatin I like this recipe two ingredients anybody can do it so I'm going to dissolve the gelatin in the fruit juice just like that and then pour the hot juice in and the good thing is you can do it with all different kinds of juices I like to use the clear juices okay mmm love the smell of Concord grape juice so we get this nice and hot doesn't have to be totally hot but just had enough to dissolve the gelatin yeah it's definitely ready there's a pour this in mix it up we pour it into the pan let it set then I'm going to cut out of shape to the kids they'll love them I'm having a party my friend Kim is doing the table setting isn't that nice her family's the beach and I'm doing the cooking so I'm gonna make Parmesan chicken which i think is great for kids and for adults Tamas on chicken to something my mother used to make for us as kids and I thought it'd be really fun to make my party it's boneless chicken breast I'm gonna cut each one into four long strips now I'm gonna do a coating so they have three things that we addictive chicken it and the first one is a cup of flour which are in the season with a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of pepper and just mix that up together so that's seasoned flour the second thing is two eggs a tablespoon of water just gonna mix those together and the third dish is a cup of seasoned breadcrumbs and you can just buy them already seasoned they're really very good about a cup and a half a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese which I keep in their fridge I'm just gonna mix those together well I can already smell the parmesan and the herbs wonderful okay and then I'm just gonna take these little chicken tenders and roll them roll whole bunch of them in flour and then dust them off there's a little bit of a process but it really means that the coating sticks to the chicken and make sure you get egg on all the parts and then move messy into the bread crumb and parmesan mixture coat the whole thing okay so now I'm going to saute them so as I usually do I'm going to mix oil and butter two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of oil melt these together you do this in a big pan but if you know of such a big pan you can always do it into smaller ones I'm gonna get this nice and hot and then saute the chicken and I'm gonna serve it with broccoli and bowties and for dessert what kid doesn't like ice cream sundaes and truffles so good and then go to chicken strips these are going to saute for about three to five minutes until they're really beautifully browned on the outside and still tender on the inside first I'm gonna go wash my hands okay ready to turn these guys throw they're nicely browned we'll be careful not to overcook because chicken can get really tough if it's overcooked gets tough and dry so these look great they smell spicy to the parmesan and smell the herbs and they're still really tender inside and if they start to stick a little bit just add more butter and oil to the pan I can keep these warm in the oven at 200 degrees for about fifteen to thirty minutes and they'll still be really tender and crisp on the outside these are gonna be so good for the stick on it everybody's on have a really good time so I thought it'd be find out the kids eat their juice so making fruit juice shapes it's grape juice and gelatin and I'm just gonna dunk this pan in hot water to loosen it a little bit that should do it okay turn it out on this plate and then cut out shapes and it worked okay I've got all kinds of you can cut it out in any shapes but I'm gonna do hearts and circles not great I love the weight jiggles and some rounds love to have circles that have fluted edges on them and some little hearts and it's fun when the grown-ups get to play - you make this all kinds of juices but I like the clear ones best like white grape juice or cranberry juice and they end up with a sort of jewel like colors which is great cuz you can also make it with orange juice if you want to and since these really are delicious there's one for me too one last thing to do with the parmesan chicken that smells great so I want to make chicken on a stick sometimes I use skewers but I think they're a little pointy for young kids so I'm going to use one of these so Oh Todd each piece of chicken is gonna go on a stick and it's gonna be like an ice cream pop it's great it's fun for the kids but I have to tell you it's really fun for the adults too oh I hear children hi you guys are fun at the beach what you do you run around a lot make a lot of noise yeah oh good it was beautiful - I'm making parmesan chicken on a stick does that look like fun to eat no good I can't wait either okay girls let's go let's it aren't to finish I'll see you in a second are they adorable

much Kim close Thank You Todd have a good trip and I'll see you again soon bye that was really fun but I may never eat candy again okay that's great nice and smooth so I'm gonna put in a little bit of vanilla that I have a teaspoon a really important ingredient for chocolate is coffee I'll show you for some reason coffee really brings out the flavour in chocolate so I'm just gonna add about a tablespoon of hot brewed coffee won't really taste it so for dinner we're having parmesan chicken broccoli with bowties ice cream sundaes and chocolate truffles truffles are easier than you think they are it's basically cream which I've got nice and hot now and lots of chocolate which I'm going to cup up really fine so I've got a half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate and a half a pound of bitter chocolate the reason why I use both of them is because I think bittersweet chocolates a little too bitter my friends are coming from this city with their two adorable children and I thought I'd make children's food that grown-ups would like we're gonna feel like kids in a candy store and then a whisk and just stir it slowly until the hot cream melts the chocolate so I'm gonna make this mixture let it sit until it gets firm and then make little balls out of it and roll it in cocoa powder and confectioner sugar so good I love when it gets really shiny and it's doing that and semi-sweet chocolates a little too sweet so I combined them to get the best of both worlds so I'm just gonna chop this up really finely that's good I'm gonna put it all in a big bowl and what smells good already and then I'm gonna take the hot cream that just boiled I pour it through a sieve just to make sure you know sometimes you get a little bit of a skin on the top and you don't want that to happen
[Music] I love Thanksgiving it's all the great fun of a holiday meal without all of that gift-giving that goes on later so I've been asked to write a magazine article about Thanksgiving dinner for just two and I thought I'd take the challenge so today I'm gonna test some traditional recipes but with a twist first tomato basil palm --yes which are a light delicious appetizer I can make in advance and bake before dinner then instead of a huge 20-pound turkey golden roasted Cornish hens which are perfect dinner for two stuffed with cornbread stuffing flavored with lots of onions and celery instead of mashed potatoes I'm making my favorite mashed turnips with crispy shallots and tender broccolini sauteed and garlic and butter and for dessert my friend Miguel's come in to do a table decoration entirely made of candy and fruit and he's not the only one helping out with the Thanksgiving for two my husband Jeffrey's agreed to be a taste tester I hope it's good so the first recipe I wanted to test for my Thanksgiving dinner is sun-dried tomato pom yeas now I've always made sweet pot amuse which of those elephant ears with sugar and I thought wouldn't it be great to make savory ones so the first thing is 100 cups of sun-dried tomatoes I'm just gonna chop them up because they're gonna end up being ground up in the food processor so I've got one and a quarter cups of sun-dried tomatoes it's really like making pesto gonna make it with basil Parmesan cheese garlic no I think about nine cloves of garlic I want about three tablespoons of minced garlic you don't have to chop a cellphone because the food processor is going to do all the work just put that in already smell the garlic and then I'm just gonna grind it up okay next thing is basil lots of it these are great flavors together basil and garlic and sun-dried tomatoes I want about five cups of basil leaves just gonna roughly take these off mmm love the way it smells okay right near the food processor get it a teaspoon of salt just a pepper really just like a pesto and then grind it all up [Music] and now I'm gonna slowly add 3/4 of a cup of olive oil and a cup of grated Parmesan cheese [Music] it smells great [Music] tomato and basil and garlic I wonder if it'd be good over pasta Jeffrey's out buying corn bread and broccolini well the comrade I know is gonna get right but the broccolini I wonder let's see she wants broccolini well this is broccoli but I broccoli need two bunches of broccolini I think this is it it looks a little different I'll get two bunches let's see cornbread here we go I'll hold my breath to make sure it's the right stuff puff pastry's this great little secret it's available in the freezer of every grocery store in America and if you've ever made it yourself you never want to do it so I've got one sheet that I've defrosted in the refrigerator this is still cold but if it gets warm and it's hard to work with just chill it for about five minutes just lightly roll it not too much so I'm going to take some of the sun-dried tomato pesto I'll just put it right on top it smells good I can smell the garlic and the tomato and just spread it out I suppose you could probably make savory puff pastry palm yays with all different kinds of things just plain pesto or Gris air and parmesan so just roll this right to the edge I want every Pommier to have the sun-dried tomato pesto on it that's really smooth okay and I'll show you how to roll it up so you can just like that on both sides and then halfway and again so it meets right at the middle so what happens is those layers of butter when the heat from the oven hits the layers of butter the water evaporates and it causes the pastry to really puff up and that's why it's called puff pastry and then you just fold it over just like that okay that's a nice little package so just slice about 3/8 inch slices it's like between a quarter and a half well they don't look like much now but I think they're gonna taste great okay quick egg wash which is an egg beaten with tablespoon of water just so they'd get nice and brown he's gonna make it a really high temperature by 400 degrees for about 10 or 11 minutes I'm gonna flip them halfway through around and crisp on both sides okay that's done these are gonna be really good and next I'm going to test Cornish hands with cornbread stuffing sounds good so the first thing I'm gonna do is make cornbread stuffing for the Cornish ends I've got everything already except the cornbread I've sent Jeffrey off to get it with a broccolini I hope he comes back with the right thing so they have to stick of unsalted butter it's four tablespoons and one cup of chopped onion it's about half of a large yellow onion I'm just gonna cook it for a few minutes until the onions turn translucent the next thing I need is one stalk of celery I'm just gonna dice it just run your knife right down the middle we used to make turkeys of every contestant with all different kinds of stuffing we'd make urban Apple stuffing sausage stuffing but I have to say my favorite was cornbread stuffing and it's really easy because you can buy cornbread from a store you can make it from a mix or you can make it yourself gonna have to celery to the onions and butter so they cook just a little bit 1/2 a cup of chicken stock how'd your shopping trip go good I got some rye bread you got corn bread broccolini thank you sweetie give the best shot so I'm testing a Thanksgiving dinner for two for magazines do you want to be my chief taste tester yeah they're gonna be really tough critic okay I'll meet you later [Music] Jeffrey got a nice cornbread cornbread stuffing is really classic Thanksgiving thing I like really simple ones but you can always add sausage or chestnuts whatever you like the hard part here is scaling it down so that I can make enough for two Cornish hams so I'm just guessing I need about two and a half cups of corn bread crumbs but since I'm recipe testing I never know just crumble it up like this I'm gonna add all that that's it this looks about right Ashley I think cornbread has more flavor than just regular breadcrumbs it's a little sweeter things can be really good okay so the corn breads all crumbled up I'm gonna add the celery and onions chicken stock right to the bone okay let's see okay a little bit parsley would be goodness it's like flat leaf parsley I think there's a little more flavor than curly parsley but whatever you have around is just fine okay it's just chop it up roughly I think about two tablespoons should do it rough chop doesn't have to be perfect okay and maybe a little salt and pepper to taste not too much cuz the corn breads got salt and pepper in it already stir it up make sure the cornbread absorbs all the butter and onions and parsley all the flavor okay time to stuff these guys so these are two Cornish hens if you can find fresh ones they're really good and I put them on a bed of onion so the onions cook with the Cornish hands just stand them on their little ends and fill each one Cornish ants are really like little chickens so they cook the same way but in less time okay that little guy's got that guy's good and then this guy the good news about this instead of cooking a turkey for hours these guys take about 35 to 40 minutes to cook well it looks like I made way too much stuffing for two Cornish hens but I guess that's why i test recipes notes had their little legs together the whole point of tying these things together is to make sure everything's very tight and it cooks evenly and then just tuck the little wings underneath so they stay tight okay more just keep these guys together so it's close to the body tuck their little wings under okay and then in order for them to Brennan you want the outside to be very dry it's a little paper towel I'm just gonna drive it and you can put a little bit of butter or olive oil on the outside I think I'll do olive oils right here just just a little olive oil it really helps it Brown nicely and keeps it moist let's rub it on the outside with a salt and pepper make sure it's really nicely seasoned okay I'm gonna roast these 425 for about 35 to 40 minutes until they're brown on the outside and juicy and tender inside [Music] my friend Miguel I'm so happy to see you dude thank you so much for doing this you know I love it seven so it's all edible things you'd be a bit absolutely every I can't wait to see what you're gonna do I get you all set up by the fireplace and right now I have a Davison turnips everybody thinks about mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving but I wanted to do something different so I thought I'd make mashed turnip no this isn't like the traditional turnip which is white with a little purple on it this is a rutabaga and you've seen it in the store you've never known what to do with it but it's really good it's gorgeous and yellow inside and I'm gonna do it with crispy shallots which I'm already cooking here and I'm just frying the shallots for about 35 minutes until they're nice and crisp and brown and I think they're just about there I'm just gonna drain these on paper towels so they get really crisp so it's a creamy vegetable and crisp shallots on the top I look like two textures together don't they should be done by now so these are the turnips just gonna drain them and what I did was I peeled them dice them and cook them for about 35 or 40 minutes until they're really tender then you put a knife and you can tell it just goes in easily it's really like potato okay we put them in a food processor this is a great vegetable because it lasts a long time and you can reheat it over a double boiler okay and I'm just gonna add some hot butter and milk a cup of milk and three kurz of a stick of butter [Music] right so it's nice and smooth and creamy okay how beautiful that is that's great teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper mix it up it says great so I'm gonna serve this with crispy shallots on it's hot but right now I'm gonna keep it warm over a pan of simmering water I know what that an edible table setting so I thought candy dry fruit and nuts some ginger we have dates here California figs Thanksgiving colors oranges and yellows and reds I'm going to surround the marzipan jelly bean I'm almost there so one last thing to test for Thanksgiving dinner for two now I'm gonna make a different kind of vegetable Muslim for unusual vegetables this is called broccolini it's unlikely enough cross between broccoli and Chinese kale and it's actually more delicate than broccoli and I like it a lot so it comes with stalks and you just like broccoli but they're thinner I just want to cut off the last third which I've done and if any of them are really thick you just want to peel it a little bit it's got a nice peppery flavor it's a little sweeter than broccoli and it's just delicious so the first thing is I'm gonna blanch it in a big pot of boiling salted water lots of salt and then just throw it right in and that's gonna just boil for about three to five minutes until it's just tender and then I'm gonna shock it by putting in ice water in the meantime I think the corniche hands are done oh they smell wonderful and a nice bed of onions so I'm just gonna test it to see if it's done if you cut between the leg and the thigh and the juices run clear it's done and it's perfect so I'm just gonna cover it with aluminum foil for about 15 minutes it retains all the heat and it brings the juices and the flavors right back into or defense keeps it nice and warm for dinner meanwhile I think the broccolini is boiled and I'm just going to drain it and then shock it in ice water to stop the cooking and then later I'm going to saute it with garlic and lemon and butter to be delicious Oh Miguel your table setting looks fabulous very bountiful for Thanksgiving what do you guys like dates and crystallized ginger and I like in pumpkins and everything else that's wonderful well I don't know if my pom yeas are as successful as you table settings wanna try one they're um they're sun-dried tomatoes and basil and garlic [Music] [Laughter] [Music] let me girls table with two fabulous it's gonna be great in the article so it's time to cook the broccoli me again I'm gonna saute i blanched it first I'm gonna add a little lemon zest give it lots of flavor so a little bit of lemon zest it's good if you put it in a pan and cook it a little bit garlic just about one clove of chopped garlic keep the heat on just cook it for 30 seconds just so it's incorporated in the butter and now we had the blanch broccolini I'm gonna shake it dry as much as possible all you want to do here is just give it lots of flavor and heat it all the way through [Music] pepper lemon juice that's actually what I'd love to bland something first and then saute it before dinner it's so fast the farm ready to serve okay dinner's ready sweetie dinner's ready Jeffrey thinks that day like any other day but down here it's Thanksgiving crispy shallots Jeffrey's a very good taste tester he likes everything crispy shallots on top how bad could that be so right okay gorgeous little Cornish em and a little bit of science [Music] that looks wonderful to Thanksgiving this year the taste tests are in the real Thanksgiving well I'll be your taste tester here anytime you want now am I supposed to say that to this point I don't think anybody feels sorry nobody believed me that you bought I bought personally I want you know I picked out so what's the idea the stuffing is directly related to the cornbread that I so let's put Miguel to this edible table decorations so we've got dried fruit candied ginger I think they're crystallized walnuts they look amazing jelly beans if anybody's up for jelly beans marzipan just in case you're still hungry after that very large Cornish and in about two hours so what do you think things good enough for a

in the dinner and bringing the main course I'm doing everything else I'd say this is gonna be half the work and twice the fun I'm taking one of my favorite appetizers curried crab strudels and maple baked beans to go with Barbara's spiral ham plus a fennel and orange salad on the side and for dessert spicy poached pears [Music] no matter how easy a dinner party is it's always more fun to share the responsibilities of the friend my friend Barbara liver Minh is providing the location and she's making a ham that's gonna go with these baked beans so the first thing I did was I soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator I've got about a pound of red kidney beans here with about enough water just to cover them so I'm gonna just want to flavor the beans while I cook them I'm gonna cut one onion and eighths and just put it right in I'm gonna put in a bay leaf just once you do it and six or eight whole peppercorns just to give it some spice I'm gonna take these out later just bring this to a boil and then lower the heat and simmer it for about 15 minutes we're just gonna go to the pantry and get some sweet things and some hot things to give this lots of flavor okay first some sweet things well I have to have medal syrup actually it's interesting that maple syrup is the later in the season it's harvested the darker it is and sort of more full-bodied I like grade-a medium amber so that's maple syrup and I think some brown sugar would be good and now some spicy things ketchup and I think when you use this Chinese chili paste that's gonna give it some good heat okay I'm gonna add lots of flavor first thing is maple syrup can of maple baked beaten so that maple syrup someone do 3/4 of a cup of maple syrup this makes a lot of baked beans okay I find if you cook them all together all the spices it actually blends really well so can put them in a pot next thing is half a cup of ketchup these could catch it always use good ingredients what comes out as only as good as what goes in half a cup of ketchup and half a cup of brown sugar later I'm gonna add some things that we give really a lot of spice which is great to sort of balance the sweet okay that's a half a cup so now I'm gonna give it some spice I'm gonna end chinese chili paste which is a great ingredient to use it's not that unusual you can actually find at the grocery store one tablespoon of freshly grated ginger take the peel off the ginger it's not digestible some vegetables you don't want to peel because the nutrition is in the peel but ginger you definitely want to peel you really want to use fresh ginger it's got the most flavor so I need a tablespoon of grated ginger this really adds a lot of flavor and a lot of warmth to the dish we wonderful with the baked ham okay that's a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger just think how much flavor that's gonna put in and the last thing is one teaspoon of salt so this is the spice mix gonna heat it up with one and a half cups of cooking liquid from the beans just take some of the liquid from the bean stock perfect I'm just gonna give this a stir and let it simmer for about six minutes until the flavors blend in the meantime I think the beans are done and just check them and you can see the the covering just starts to come off when they're done they're perfect okay I'm just gonna drain the beans and I'm gonna save the cooking liquid so if it gets a little dry in the pot I can always add it later great Cup dance and extra liquid [Music] now everything's gonna go in one big pot [Music] okay the beans are just gonna go right in want to add all the spices which have been cooking together for about five or six minutes it's gonna be so flavorful [Music] this smells fantastic and now just to make sure it's really good I'm going to add about four or five ounces of good bacon that's about four or five slices gonna chop it up half of its gonna go tucked into the baked beans and half that's gonna be on top to make sure it gets a nice crust on top so half just goes right in but just fold it in and then hats gonna be strewn all over the top make sure it's really nice and moist and delicious and the smoky flavor gets into it all right lid goes on I'm gonna put these in the oven 225 degrees for 6 hours and they're gonna be so delicious next I'm gonna make crab strudels first I have a little time I think we'll hang out with Jeffrey [Music] so we're really having a dinner party tonight we are but it's a deliverance they're doing half the work I can hang out with you I like that that's terrific I always loved is there something delicious with cocktails something substantial but not so heavy that it makes you feel like you've eaten dinner already so I thought for the Liberman's I met crab strudels so first thing I need is some chopped scallions this has crabmeat scallions a little curry powder just delicious actually chop up the whole scallions some people think you should only eat the light green and white parts but I'm not quite sure why they all have flavor so I need three scallions a little bit of butter and a pan to cook them let that melt the chopped scallions in to close with garlic just mince them right up I like to put the girl again after the scallions have cooked so that garlic doesn't burn in goes the garlic that's too close chopped okay teaspoon of curry powder one good curry powder but not so spicy that it overwhelms the crabmeat okay while that cooks I'm gonna get the crab meat ready so I have one pound of lump crab meat got it at the seafood shop I just want to sort of pick through it and make sure there there are no shells every once in a while you run into a shell nobody wants to bite into shell so don't try not to break it up too much but just feel around perfect so now I need chopped parsley but two teaspoons should do it students are really flexible you can pretty much put whatever you think is appropriate in them and he left over to have a chicken and curry leftover just wrap it in a little strudel bake it and you've got a nice appetizer okay parsley a little bit of lime juice put it right in again these are flavors that really enhance the crab meat that just make it taste wonderful without overwhelming the delicate flavor [Music] okay that's good let's see how a scallions and garlic are done it's smells so good and that's gonna go right in scallions garlic and curry toss it all together this is the filling I'm gonna wrap it in phyllo dough brush it with lots of butter and then bake it off with the liver mince okay need a little bit of melted butter and now for the phyllo dough phyllo does classic Greek pastry it's very very very thin you don't want to try and make it yourself it comes in the freezer section of the grocery store and you defrost it in the refrigerator overnight so an unroll this package think about it is you want to keep it as moist as you possibly can so I put it right here on the stone I'm gonna do four layers for each strudel so take one piece of phyllo dough put on the board brush it with butter like that I actually use breadcrumbs so that the layers don't stick together when you put them together so second layer see how thin they are they're amazing what butter we're breadcrumbs these are great because you can make them in advance in fact you can make a lot of them and just freeze them so they're wonderful foragers and the fourth layer and then just press this okay and I'm gonna turn it on its edge turn it like this take the crab meat filling run up a nice roll down the side that so it'll roll up with that one inch then take the end roll it right around the crab meat and roll it as tight as tightly as you can just like that just keep rolling in each of these layers is gonna make it really nice and flaky one you can slice it and bake it okay so that's one I'm gonna brush the top with butter so it gets nice and brown when I bake it and then we're gonna bake it at Barbara's house okay the next one [Music] you [Music] I'm just slicing these into like one and a half inch slices on a diagonal I'm gonna bake them in a roll and then after they come out of the oven I'm just gonna slice them all the way through I'm gonna get to Barbara's I'm gonna bake them 400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes and they're gonna be crisp on the outside and delicious on the inside and next I'm gonna make pears poached in a sweet dessert wine vinsanto so good [Music] time to make dessert I'm going to make poach fruit in vinsanto so first I'm going to make a poaching liquid I need 750 milliliter bottle of vinsanto which is that sweet dessert wine that you very often get an Italian restaurants you dip biscotti in it it's going to be delicious with pears and dried fruit then I need 2 cups of water 1 stick of cinnamon little spice 6 cloves 6 whole cloves about 6 if you like it really spicy you can always add more and one and a half cups of sugar zest of one orange classically pears approaching Saturn but it's so expensive that I decided maybe I should try some other sweet dessert wine and see if I can get the same kind of flavor and I actually like it better I think it's wonderful and the zest of a lemon so you get sort of the fruity essence of the the pears in the poaching liquid and the poaching liquid gets into the pears okay the lemon zest goes in and the last thing is a vanilla bean we love vanilla I'm going to raise the heat bring it to a boil and then let it simmer for about ten minutes and I'll get a little rich and syrupy now we're gonna get the pears ready music Bosc pears they're actually ripe when they're brown when they're green they're not quite ripe so these guys are really ripe they're hard also so if you press them it's gonna seem like they're not ripe but they are just as long as they're not green I'm just gonna peel each one I try to leave the stems on so they look really nice you can also cut them in half and take the cores out if that's the triptych Ferb we're just gonna do them all I think it looks really great and I think the poaching liquids just about done gonna put the pears in I'm just gonna lay them on their sides I love that my friend Barbara's doing half the work not only makes it easier to have a party but she's a really great party giver makes it so much more fun okay so these are gonna cook for about 20 minutes until the pears are really tender and they've absorbed all that wonderful vinsanto sauce and then later I'm going to add figs prunes and apricots and a little puff up in the liquid that'd be really good and dinner's almost ready to take to Barbara's and she's gonna make a wonderful ham [Music] hey here's a ham I called about morning Bob yes we do take a peek sure oh it's beautiful and how do I cook it a fully cooked ham I'm gonna preheat the oven to 325 okay put the hand min approximately an hour and a half need an internal temperature of 130 degrees I can do this okay sure you can thank you for doing all the work for me look nice great so I'm going to snip off the little hard stems from about one and a half cups of figs and just put them right into the poaching liquid with the pears I love a dish like this where the pears and the vesanto and the figs they all sort of flavor each other it's just wonderful and then wanting to have cups of dried apricots I'm just gonna approximate it it's a great dish when pears are in season and the only good fruit you can get are dried fruit and three quarters of a cup of pitted prunes I don't like the pits and things so it's good to have them pitted I know that the fruits simmer for about five to ten minutes until the pears are just perfectly cooked and all the dried fruit is all plumped up and it absorbs all the wonderful cooking liquid and then I'm gonna chill it all all I have to do is make fennel salad and we're off to the libertage last thing to do for the dinner with the Liberman's gonna make a really crunchy fennel salad with orange it's gonna be delicious with the baked beans but this is fennel you can find them in the grocery store it used to be hard to find but you can find them anywhere now and you just want the bowl I'm gonna cut it in half and then just cut the little core out which is kind of tough let's cut that little core out so I've got the slicing disk in just put it right in the top right down look how great that is how easy was that very thinly sliced fennel so the next thing I want to slice four oranges just peel the oranges with a little knife and I'm just gonna slice it right onto the salad if it's easier just to slice it right on the board fennel was a very sort of savory taste has really particularly interesting sort of anise flavor the orange is sweet and then the vinaigrette with the lemon is tart so it's great okay so that's three oranges just toss them together okay now I'm gonna make a lemon vinaigrette quarter of a cup of olive oil two tablespoons of lemon juice could be orange but I think these a little bit of tartness depending on the size of the lemon that will either be half a lemon or a whole one okay teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper just stir it all together okay now I'm just gonna drizzle the vinaigrette right on the fennel normally in a salad I'd wait until I'm ready to serve it but because the fennel is really firm it can handle being dressed right now I'm gonna put a little bit of arugula round the outside it's really great combination flavors it's sweet its tart it's gonna be wonderful with a ham and big boost just a sprinkling of fennel fronds why not use the whole thing look so pretty and that's a really easy salad to go with big beans in him it's time to pack up and go [Music] maple baked beans looks so good and after such a ham and big being dinner it's

curried crab strudels and maple baked beans to go with Barbara's spiral ham plus a fennel and orange salad on the side and for dessert spicy poached pears [Music] no matter how easy a dinner party is it's always more fun to share the responsibilities with a friend my friend Barbara Lee Berman is providing the location and she's making a ham that's gonna go with these baked beans so the first thing

okay that's a half a cup so now I'm gonna give it some spice I'm gonna end chinese chili paste which is a great ingredient to use it's not that unusual you can actually find at the grocery store one tablespoon of freshly grated ginger take the peel off the ginger it's not digestible some vegetables you don't want to peel because the nutrition is in the peel but ginger you definitely want to peel you really want to use fresh ginger it's got the most flavor so I need a tablespoon of grated ginger this really adds a lot of flavor and a lot of warmth to the dish we wonderful with the baked ham okay that's a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger just think how much flavor that's gonna put in and the last thing is 1 teaspoon of salt so this is the spice mix gonna heat it up with one and a half cups of cooking liquid from the beans just take some of the liquid from the bean stock perfect I'm just gonna give this a stir and let it simmer for about 6 minutes until the flavors blend and the meantime I think the beans are done and just check them and you can see the the covering just starts to come off when they're done they're perfect okay I'm just going to drain the beans and I'm gonna save the cooking liquid so if it gets a little dry in the pot I can always add it later great cup dance and extra liquid now everything's gonna go in one big pot [Music] okay the beans are just gonna

crust on top so half just goes right in but just fold it in and then hats gonna be strewn all over the top make sure it's really nice and moist and delicious and the smoky flavor gets into it all right lid goes on and I put these in the oven 225 degrees for six hours and they're gonna be so delicious next I'm going to make crab strudels first I have a little time I think we'll hang out with Jeffrey [Music] so we're really having a dinner party tonight we are but it's a deliverance they're doing half the work I can hang out with you I like that that's terrific right I always love to stir something delicious with cocktails something substantial but not so heavy that it makes you feel like you've eaten dinner already so I thought for the Liberman's I'd make crab strudels so first thing I need is some chopped scallions this has crabmeat scallions a little curry powder just delicious actually chopped up the whole scallions some people think you should only eat the white green and white parts but I'm not quite sure why they all have flavor so I need three scallions a little bit of butter and a pan to cook them let that melt the chopped scallions in to close with garlic just mince them right up I like to put the girl again after the scallions have cooked so that garlic doesn't burn in goes the garlic that's too close chopped okay teaspoon of curry powder one good curry powder but not so spicy that it overwhelms the crabmeat okay while that cooks I'm gonna get the crab meat ready so I have 1 pound of lump crabmeat got it at the seafood shop I just want to sort of pick through it and make sure there there are no shells every once in a while you run into a shell nobody wants to bite into shell so don't try not to break it up too much but just feel around perfect so now I need chopped parsley but two teaspoons should do it students are really flexible you can pretty much put whatever you think is appropriate in them and he left over to have a chicken and curry leftover just wrap it in a little strudel bake it and you've got a nice appetizer okay parsley a little bit of lime juice put it right in again these are flavors that really enhance the crab meat that just make it taste wonderful without overwhelming the delicate flavor [Music] okay that's good let's see it was scallions and garlic you're down it's so good and this is gonna go right in scallions garlic and curry toss it all together this is the filling I'm gonna wrap it in phyllo dough brush it with lots of butter and then bake it off with the liver mints okay I need a little bit of melted butter and after the phyllo dough phyllo dough is classic Greek pastry it's very very very thin you don't want to try and make it yourself it comes in the freezer section of the grocery store and you defrost it in the refrigerator overnight so I'm gonna unroll this package think about it is you want to keep it as moist as you possibly can so I put it right here on the stone I'm gonna do four layers for each strudel so take one piece of phyllo dough put on the board brush it with butter like that I actually use breadcrumbs so that the layers don't stick together when you put them together so second layer see how thin they are they're amazing more butter more breadcrumbs [Music] these are great because you can make them in advance in fact you can make a lot of them and just freeze them so they're wonderful foragers and the fourth layer and then just brush this alright now I'm going to turn it on its edge turn it like this take the crab meat filling run a nice roll down the side that so it will roll up with that one inch and take blow dose classic Greek pastry it's very very very thin you don't want to try and make it yourself it comes in the freezer section of the grocery store and you defrost it in the refrigerator overnight so an unroll this package think about it is you want to keep it as moist as you possibly can so I put it right here on the stone I'm gonna do four layers for each strudel so take one piece of phyllo dough put on the board brush it with butter like that I actually use bread crumbs so that the layers don't stick together when you put them together so second layer see how thin they are they're amazing what butter we're breadcrumbs these are great because you can make them in advance in fact you can make a lot of them and just freeze them so they're wonderful foragers and the fourth layer and then just brush this there's a cup of pitted prunes I don't like the pits and things so it's good to have them pitted well at the fruit simmer for about five to ten minutes until the pears are just perfectly cooked and all the dried fruit is all plumped up and it absorbs all the wonderful cooking liquid and then I'm gonna chill it all all I have to do is make fennel salad and we're off to the Liberman's [Music] last thing to do for the dinner with the Liberman's gonna make a really crunchy fennel salad with orange it's gonna be delicious with the baked beans but this is fennel you can find them in the grocery store used to be hard to find but you can find them anywhere now and you just want the bowl I'm gonna cut it in half and then just cut the little core out which is kind of tough let's cut that little core out so I've got the slicing disk in just put it right in the top right down look how great that is how easy was that very thinly sliced fennel so the next thing I want to slice four oranges just peel the oranges with a little knife and I'm just gonna slice it right onto the salad if it's easier just to slice it right on the board okay that's good let's see it was scallions and garlic adone it's smells so good and that's just gonna go right in scallions garlic and curry toss it all together this is the filling I'm gonna wrap it in phyllo dough brush it with lots of butter and then bake it off with the liver mince okay need a little bit of melted butter and now for the phyllo dough philo does classic Greek pastry it's very very very thin you don't want to try and make it yourself it comes in the freezer section of the grocery store and you defrost it in the refrigerator overnight so an unroll this package think about it is you want to keep it as moist as you possibly can so I put it right here on the stone I'm gonna do four layers for each strudel so take one piece of phyllo dough put on the board brush it with butter like that I actually use bread crumbs so that the layers don't stick together when you put them together so second layer on each of these layers is gonna make it really nice and flaky when you slice it and bake it okay so that's one I'm gonna brush the top with butter so it's nice and brown when I bake it and then they're gonna bake it at Barbara's house okay the next one [Music] I'm just slicing these into like one and a half inch slices on a diagonal I'm gonna bake them in a row
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now we visit one of the most successful, prolific women in America, the creative force behind the Barefoot Contessa cookbooks and TV shows. William Brangham recently went to see Ina Garten at her home on Long Island, New York, and has this look at her life and career. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Can I have another bite? INA GARTEN, Chef: You can have as much as you like. (LAUGHTER) WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is the best job. (LAUGHTER) INA GARTEN: Isn't it? This is what I get to do for a living. Isn't it unbelievable? WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's fantastic. Ina Garten is one of the most famous and beloved cooks in America today. Better known as the Barefoot Contessa, she sits atop a culinary empire built on her bestselling cookbooks, with millions of copies sold, a string of hit TV shows. INA GARTEN: Just because it's a weeknight dinner doesn't mean it has to be boring. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And a legion of devoted fans. INA GARTEN: This is my little secret garden. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We visited Garten at her home and headquarters in East Hampton, New York. We talked in the huge barn she had built next to her House that's now her office, test kitchen and TV studio, all in one. INA GARTEN: This is where the show is shot, and this is where we test recipes. And every morning, I walk across the lawn and I meet the two people, Barbara and Lidey, who work with me. And we just go, OK, what are we going to do today? WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's the extent of your commute? INA GARTEN: That's my commute. (LAUGHTER) INA GARTEN: It's like 100 yards, I think, maybe less, maybe 50. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Pretty amazing. INA GARTEN: It's pretty amazing. I usually just put it right in the middle. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Garten's career began 40 years ago. But, at first, she gave no hint as to how she'd evolve. In the 1970s, newly married to husband Jeffrey, Garten was a budget analyst in Washington, D.C., INA GARTEN: I was working at OMB, Office of Management and Budget. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the federal government? INA GARTEN: Yes, for Ford and Carter. And I worked on nuclear energy policy. How's that for precedent for the food business? WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It makes no sense whatsoever. (LAUGHTER) INA GARTEN: I ran from it. And by the late '70s, I thought, I have been working here for four years, and nothing has happened. And I just didn't feel like I had any impact on anything. And I hit 30, and I thought, I want to do what I want to do. And I thought, I want to be in the food business. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One day, she saw an ad for a specialty food store for sale in the Hamptons, the exclusive beach destination for New Yorkers. INA GARTEN: I went home and I told Jeffrey about it, and he said, pick something you love to do. If you love doing it, you will be really good at it. And so I made her a very low offer, the woman who was selling it, thinking, well, we will come back. We will negotiate. We drove back to Washington. I was in my office the next day and the phone rang. And she said, thank you very much. I accept your offer. And I just remember going, oh (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (LAUGHTER) WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What have I gotten myself into? INA GARTEN: What have I done? WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that was it? INA GARTEN: That was it. Two months later, I was behind the counter of a specialty foods store, trying to figure it out. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The store she bought was called the Barefoot Contessa. That was the nickname of the prior owner. It was 1978, and this was Garten's very first job in the food industry. So, had you been a cook before? INA GARTEN: No. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Not at all? INA GARTEN: I'd never worked in a store. I never worked in a restaurant. I mean, I cooked at home, but that's not really the same thing. I taught myself how to cook when I worked in Washington using Julia Child's cookbooks. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And you have had no training beyond that? INA GARTEN: No. No. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's amazing. INA GARTEN: Thank you. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The store was a smash, and later moved to a bigger location in East Hampton. After 18 years, she sold the store and tried her hand at a new venture. In 1999, the Barefoot Contessa cookbook was published, and it quickly became a bestseller. Nine additional books have followed, each a bestseller. All contain her trademark simple and accessible recipes. INA GARTEN: I think that I had a very clear vision when I started writing cookbooks what I wanted it to be, and that you would open the book, that you would look at the photograph and go, that looks delicious. And then you would look at the recipe and say, I can actually make that and I can make it with ingredients I can find in the grocery store. I don't think that's changed at all. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Having taught yourself how to cook, does that inform the recipes that end up in your book, because you're thinking of them not from a professionally trained mind, but someone who did this on her own? INA GARTEN: That's really smart. Actually, when I first started writing cookbooks, I remember thinking to myself, what makes me think I can write a cookbook? There are these great chefs who are really trained. And, as I started, I realized, actually, what is my lack is actually exactly right, because I can connect with -- cooking's hard for me. I never worked on... WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Cooking is hard for you? INA GARTEN: It is so hard for me. Anybody that works with me will tell you. It's so hard for me. And that's why my recipes are really simple, because I want to be able to do them. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Soon, executives at the Food Network came calling, and calling, and calling. I understand you were reluctant at first to do television? INA GARTEN: Reluctant is the understatement. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Really? INA GARTEN: I just said no over and over and over again. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why? INA GARTEN: I just didn't think I'd be good on TV. I just couldn't imagine why anybody would watch it. And Food Network, fortunately, kept coming back again and again. And they said, just try it. And I thought, well, I will just do 13 shows, and then they will leave me alone. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that was how many shows later? INA GARTEN: And, happily, that was 15 years later. (LAUGHTER) INA GARTEN: I'm still doing it. I'm going to show you my recipes and my techniques. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Barefoot Contessa series is now 13 seasons' strong. INA GARTEN: You too can cook like a pro. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Her latest version, "Cook Like a Pro," shows tips and techniques aimed at helping viewers become more comfortable in the kitchen. INA GARTEN: Everything you need to know, from trussing the bird to carving it. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do you know of your audience? Who is watching it? INA GARTEN: You know, there's this moment in time when I really got a vision of who the audience was. I was walking up Madison Avenue, and there was a woman in a big fur coat. And she said, "Oh, darling, love your cookbooks." And I thought, that's very nice. Then I kept going. About a half-a-block later, a truck driver pulled over and said, "Hey, baby, love your show." (LAUGHTER) INA GARTEN: And I thought, that's food. I think my cookbook audience might be slightly different from my TV audience, but I think they're people that are interested in food, and that's everybody. You're doing a beautiful job, I have to tell you. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You're just saying that. (LAUGHTER) WILLIAM BRANGHAM: During our visit, Garten showed us a few simple recipes. You can see her demonstrate them on our Web site. Meanwhile, she says her days are now spent testing new recipes for her upcoming 11th cookbook. It's due in the fall of next year. INA GARTEN: I love what I'm doing. I'm really happy doing it, and I hope I can do It forever. And I'm having a ball. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ina Garten, so great to talk to you. Thank you very much. INA GARTEN: Well, it was so much fun to talk to you too, William. (LAUGHTER) HARI SREENIVASAN: Online, one "NewsHour" staffer shares what Ina Garten taught her about life, love, and dijon vinaigrette. That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.
I'm starting with a big roasting chicken first thing I want to do is salt and pepper the inside of the cavity I've already washed and patted it dry lots of salt inside to give it lots of flavor and lots of pepper once it's have great flavor and I'm going to take a whole head of garlic I'm not even going to peel it just cut it right in half and all that garlic flavor just gets right into the chicken sweet delicious and the next thing I'm going to do with lemons because I love the way the lemon taste in chicken so I'm just going to quarter this and put that right into the chicken just that way and then some fresh thyme big sprig of fresh thyme right in the middle all this is really just to give the chicken more flavor as it roasts if you have other herbs around like oregano or rosemary or something like that you can also use that but I particularly like thyme okay now I'm going to show you how to trust a chicken it's really simple just want to do two things and let tie the legs together a little bit of kitchen string just tie these guys together this is really about making sure that the chicken cooks evenly if the legs are flapping around in the pan they're going to cook faster than the rest of the chicken and the wings are the same thing you don't want them flapping around in the pan so what you want to do is just turn them backwards and tuck them right underneath the body of the chicken they keep them closed just like that and you can brush the whole top with butter just to make sure that it has lots of flavor and that it Browns really nicely in the pan I'm gonna sprinkle it without the salt and pepper and now comes the surprising part I'm going to put strips of bacon over the top which is going to actually give it lots of flavor and then later I'm going to crumble the crisp bacon into the salad so going to be a combination of dishes this is the usual friday-night chicken but dressed up for company now I'm going to add more flavor to the sauce too by putting in garlic in the pan another whole head of garlic just cut right in half even roast it in a pan and then the juices from the chicken are going to make a sauce with the garlic and I think I'll put in two lemons so these are the flavors in the chicken that's also going to add to the sauce cut off the end and then just cut it in half and do big wedges and you'll see the lemon is going to brown and just and have great flavor right in the sauce just right in the pan stooop instead of vegetables okay so I think it's already 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes and before it's done I'm going to take the bacon also the chicken Browns really nicely
[Music] Barbara live F is my assistant and dear friend her daughter Cassandra is not only gorgeous but she's a competitive beach volleyball player I thought it'd be fun for Barbara and me to take a picnic down to the beach and watch them play for Barbara and me I'm making sweet and spicy curry chicken wraps containers of panzanella an Italian vegetable salad with toasted bread cubes and I'm sending Cassandra to the beach with peanut butter and jelly bars for all the volleyball players to give them energy I've never been one for going to the beach and lying in the Sun but for a picnic with Barbara and a volleyball game I'm willing to get a little sand in my shoes at one time or another we've all thought it was a good idea to cook at the beach it's not little gust of wind sand in your food so I'm gonna make a picnic for Barbara and me but everything's made in advance and so I served at room temperature first thing is curry chicken laughs first thing I do is roast chicken and what I've got is chicken breast on the bone for the skin still on I've tried it a million different ways that's the best way to make cooked chicken salad rub a little olive oil on the top whoa better lot just a little sprinkle with salt and pepper into the oven 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and a semi tender and juicy I wasn't wanting to make a dessert that tasted like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I thought cookies no peanut butter and jelly bars and I made them and people went crazy so I thought it'd be fun to give to Cassandra to take down to the beach for her friends maybe everyone left over for Barbara and me so I'll show you how to make the first thing is and of course I have to kind of butter getting a bad reputation here one and a half cups of sugar but this is like a shortbread with peanut butter in it and jelly in the middle so cream together the butter and sugar be sure to use room-temperature butter it makes all the difference in the world when you're baking I just need it for a minute until it's light and fluffy and then on a low speed add two eggs one at a time he's been a vanilla and 18 ounces of peanut butter yikes okay now for the dry ingredients three cups of flour one teaspoon of baking powder and one and a half of salt just sift that all together so it's really as simple as making shortbread okay with a mixer on low just slowly put the dry ingredients into the wet ones or should I say the dry ingredients in the peanut ones hope in a cloud of flour okay that looks great yeah it's like one big peanut butter cookie put the Dex go pan then I greased and floured and put a little parchment paper on the bottom so I'm gonna take 2/3 of the dough and just Pat it on the bottom a little bit and just Pat this out into the bottom of the pan to the champ art but 18 am chance of jam which has got one and a half cups smells like a PB&amp;J sandwich another six ounces so we have 18 ounces all together just spread it evenly over the peanut butter shortbread layer and peanut butter crumble on the top so take the shortbread and just little pieces of dough just drop them across the top it doesn't have to touch when it bakes it all go together just sort of crumble it evenly on top and then we put nuts on top peanuts I'll give it a crunch so it's creamy it's sweet it's peanut e and it's crunchy I bet can that be very casual okay let's play on the top of chopped peanuts salted peanuts are really good these are gonna bake it's 350 degrees for 45 minutes and you would believe how good they are chicken should be done for the Kurd chicken wraps way you can tell is by pressing if it's really firm to the touch it's done so I'm just going to let this cool I'm gonna go shopping for ingredients for my panzanella wait you see this so I've done some cooking and I'm off to the market to get vegetables to my panzanella and the Kurd chicken rest nice thing about a small town is the markets not so far away so sometimes I come to the produce market it's sort of the equivalent of standing the refrigerator door looking for inspiration just looking for something that would be great I'm making curried chicken wraps in a tortilla and you know I think might be nice a little bit of celery for a crunch would be good and a little scallion for a little bite that'll be good too the next thing I'm gonna make is panzanella which is like a chunky vegetable salad with toasted cubes of bread and vinaigrette all over it it's so good and I'm gonna get some red peppers that looks like a nice firm one some yellow peppers that's a pretty one you want really firm things that if their wrinkly they've been around too long these are gorgeous and the last thing I wanted some some cucumbers now you can get these regular cucumbers these are sort of a garden-variety cucumbers but they're a little bit bitter and I find that skin very tough the ones I love are called hot house or seedless cucumbers and they're very thin-skinned they're absolutely delicious and they have very little seeds and they're sweet it'll be so good in the panzanella hey who are you good or just dead [Music] if butter and jelly bars are baked and cooled what do you see in them not look amazing Cassandra and her friends are gonna go crazy so far we're gonna pack them up and send them to the beach and had to be something beachy so I thought I'd wrap them all in parchment and send them in a little beach pale pale so what I made for you I made a beach pale filled with peanut butter and jelly I think we can probably fudge one right here nobody'll ever know so the peanut butter shortbread with raspberry jam delicious and napkins for the beach and I'll see you at the beach I can't wait to watch you play volleyball okay I've never since she was five she incredibly lovely I can't wait to see her play volleyball she's amazing so the chickens cooked for the chicken curry wraps and I have to make the sauce one and a half cups of mayonnaise use good mayonnaise it makes such a difference third of a cup of white wine that'll thin it and give it a better texture and flavor quarter of a cup of chutney curry and chutneys a classic combination and three tablespoons of good curry powder you know they're all different kinds of curry powder is actually an assortment of spices some are spicy or some are sweeter I like a sweet one someone can put three tablespoons in but it depends on what kind of curry powder you use so maybe start with two and then add more 1/2 teaspoons of salt already smells good I love curry and chutney together looks good so now I'm going to show you how I do chicken you can cut it up for chicken sound lots of different ways I can dice it but I find for something like the wraps if you shred the chicken it actually catches more of the sauce it's better in a wrap so I'm just gonna take the skin off and then just with your fingers just pull the meat away from the bone I wanna make sure they're cool enough so you can handle them and then just start shredding it you can see that the chickens really moist makes such a difference instead of boiling chicken for salad to roast it like that really keeps the texture and the flavor I'm gonna pour on the sauce a few more ingredients two stalks of celery get some crunch and two scallions give it a little heat and a quarter of a cup of raisins these are all the topics that you'd normally have when curry and later I'm gonna add roasted cashews so we'll put this in the fridge until the flavors blend really well and then I'm gonna make panzanella which is this delicious Italian salad with bread I brought some peanut butter and jelly bars strawberry jelly my favorite is a peanut butter cookie almost we got the peanuts in the top like chunky peanut butter it's good stuff I actually didn't move to the beach can be tricky sometimes you want something's really easy to eat that can be served at room temperature my assistant Barbara and I are going to the beach and I'm gonna take panzanella which she loves and I think I'll serve it in those Chinese takeout containers first thing we do is heat up some oil and then toast break cubes in it Italians made up the salad to use leftover bread so it's a great way to use it if it's a little bit dry it's even better really soaks up a vinaigrette big chunks the first time Barbara and I tested this recipe we we decided any salad that has bread cubes dipped in vinaigrette was just fine with us I think we actually ate around the vegetables okay oils hot just tossing the bread cubes no salt tell them around your home and while those toasts I'm gonna make a nice garlic vinaigrette for the salad can't make garlic vinaigrette with that one clove of garlic I need a bad teaspoon it should be just right now okay so about a teaspoon of garlic right into the bowl half a teaspoon of good Dijon mustard three tablespoons if I use champagne vinegar you can use any good white wine vinegar half a cup of good olive oil mustard will actually emulsify the vinaigrette which is nice 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1/4 of a teaspoon of pepper and that's the vinaigrette so next is getting vegetables ready the first thing is the cucumber I really like seedless cucumbers that are called English or hothouse cucumbers just right off the ends cut it in half and then with a small spoon or a tea spoon just take out the seeds it's called seedless but it has a few seeds but it's so much less bitter than regular American cucumbers it's just when a knife right down in the middle what this a really chunky salad you don't want finely chopped so I already have red peppers yellow peppers and red onions thinly sliced I got chunky cucumbers this is gonna make a lot of sound and the longer it sits the better it tastes okay that's the cucumbers got Tomatoes these are good Israeli Tomatoes so big chunky slices of tomato it's a really casual salad okay so into a ball [Music] that great it's so colorful okay then I'm gonna add some capers about three tablespoons fresh basil okay that looks a good part croutons they're perfectly toasted great warm croutons vinaigrette [Music] smell so good on coot on from the vinaigrette are so good together in the vegetable base all capers that's gonna be really good at the beach and Bart was going to be thrilled [Music] the things that I put in the curry salad or things that are traditionally served with curry raisins chutney and caffeine thinking about cashews is sometimes they've been sitting around in the package for a while so I always like to dry sautee them just for a few minutes to crisp them up a little bit I once salted roasted cashews just heat them in a dry pan until they're warm through wouldn't believe what a difference it hasn't flavor even when I'm just serving cashews with strengths I hate them up like this so when these are done I'm gonna fish the chicken salad put it in the wrap and we're off to the beach so the last thing I have to add to the chicken salad before I put them in the wraps is salted roasted cashews I chopped them up I thought they'd be easier to eat in a wrap this looks pretty good that's a lot here so I'm gonna make a wrap one each for Barbara and me show how this works it's big spoon of chicken sound right in the middle so I'm gonna fold the ends in and then roll the whole thing up just like that I'm just going to cut it in half separate things and one more you really do this with any kind of salad just fold the ends in and wrap it up around this chicken salad how great that works hack it up and that even the sand can get in their mouth at panzanella peanut-butter-and-jelly bars stay and we're ready to go to the beach [Music] how are they doing they're doing great who's winning well it's kind of going back and forth like on his court sitting here watching them play oh I'd love to have a pretty color my favorite my favorite Chinese takeout containers perfect creaking and round delicious lots of bread stuffing vinaigrette oh my bloody tested this recipe we had all that break but I'm the only thing that wasn't let's try some bit I'm so glad that you didn't eat the peanut butter jelly bars [Laughter]
my husband Jeffrey works in Connecticut which know about four hours away from East Hampton I want to make sure no one else is making him dinner during the week so when he leaves on Monday morning I'm gonna send him off with some really good things to eat so this morning I'm gonna surprise Jeffrey with banana sour cream pancakes they're so good but first I thought it'd be really nice to send him off to school with some dinners he can have during the week so I'm gonna make butternut squash with apple soup and Chinese chicken salad so I've got four cups of chopped onions two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of olive oil then I'm going to add two tablespoons of curry powder curry powder can really be spicy or mild I like the mild kind so two tablespoons added to the onions great I'm just gonna let that saute with the onions and the heat really brings out the flavor so while that's cooking away when you get the butternut squash and apples ready it smells so good a sort of spicy sweetness so butternut squash them I've peeled it I'm just gonna chunk it up coarsely it doesn't have to be any particular dice cuz it's all gonna go into the soup so this is about five pounds of butternut squash I'm just gonna dump it right into the pot and then the next one was the apples so this is my handy dandy vegetable peeler all comes off in one big strip look at that so I need about four peeled apples done mm hm you can really use any kind of sweet apple and I'm just gonna cut them quarters take the cores out chop them up put them right in so these are all going to sit on the stove for about 35 or 40 minutes until the apples and the butternut squash get really soft and then I'm gonna puree it and show you how to do it so it has great texture okay that's four apples and now I just need two cups of water and that's all going to cook together and stove until everything's really tender and flavorful and then I'm going to puree it in a food mill last thing is to test ins of salt went a great flavor I'm just a better half a teaspoon of black pepper curry powders really spicy I wanted to get too hot so this looks great it smells wonderful you can smell the apples in the curry powder so I'm just just a lid on put the temperature on low and it's gonna cook for about 30 to 40 minutes until the butternut squash is really tender and the apples are cooked it's gonna be wonderful so the next thing is Chinese chicken salad my husband really likes chicken so I have to find a million ways to make it and this is a great thing that you can have during the week so what I've done is i roasted chicken breast on the bone and actually for this salad I'm gonna shred the chicken I find instead of cubing it it really holds the sauce Jeff is gonna be really pleased I can't say they do this all the time but once in a while it's a real treat no kidney so next I'm gonna put in about a half a pound of asparagus it's left over from dinner last night but who knows and then I thought for some color a nice red pepper well you just cut right down on the edge rather than cutting in half where you end up with curved red pepper you end up with straight red pepper and then you can save that for a snack this is what's called julienning just cut it in big strips okay right into the salad that's some scallions to give it a little spice so I think to Scotland should do it looking good already and the last thing is toasted sesame seeds then put half the sesame seeds in the salad and half of the dressing so just a little bit oh that's good okay I'm gonna toss that a lot so into the container this goes into the fridge and then I'm gonna make the dressing first I'm gonna start with oil and vinegar as a base just like any other vinaigrette so I'm gonna use vegetable oil which is sort of flavorless but it'll give it really wonderful texture and vinegar decided I'd use apple cider vinegar cuz it's really sort of sweet it's vinegary but a little sweeter got a quarter of a cup so that's the base that three tablespoons of soy sauce and sesame oil but it's not the clear sesame oil it's the con that's made with roasted sesame seeds so it has great flavor and it's very dark so about a tablespoon and a half of sesame oil and to make it a little sweet is very complex but I think it's really interesting a little bit of honey give it a little sweetness so this is ginger it's very strange-looking I know it's a root just peel the outside you don't want to eat the outside it's really sort of bitter okay and then a box grater is the best thing to use for this and you want sort of a fine grading side for it so it really sort of grinds it up okay you'll see on the inside of the box grater it's just like that it's really sort of wet and delicious and then I think I'm going to put some garlic in give it a little spice the chicken and the sauce are gonna last for a week so Jeffrey can just put them together whenever he wants dinner okay that just goes in like that whisk it up a little bit in toasted sesame seeds so I toasted them in a dry pan just so they have that sort of really nutty flavor and now the secret ingredient peanut butter who knew but where is the peanut butter oh there it is it's always hiding in my pantry okay someone put some peanut butter into this it'll make it really thick and delicious it's kind of like Indonesian satay maybe I should have called this Asian chicken salad rather than Chinese I'm not sure that they use peanut butter I'm gonna whisk that in that's it into the container and then Jeffrey can have Chinese chicken salad all week super smells ready it's wonderful butternut squash and the sweet apples and curry that's gonna be so good but before I puree it I'm gonna make a little treat for the top for Jeffrey he's gonna be very happy I'm gonna make brioche croutons you know I think about making a recipe I think about the complexity of the flavors but I also like to think about the complexity of the texture I wanted to be really interesting to eat so I thought with a creamy source sweet butternut squash and Apple soup be nice to have crunchy croutons so I'm going to take a loaf of my friend Eli Zabar's wonderful brioche bread but you can get any kind of an egg bread or something like that and just cut it in three quarter-inch slices and then I like to take the crusts off but you don't have to brioche is an egg bread it has a little bit of richness I think is really good in the soup but if you have leftover bread you can make it with sourdough bread or white bread or even whole wheat these sort of big croutons French croutons are little fine ones but these are big and chunky and they're great in salads too or for snacks so that looks good I'm just gonna put a little olive oil maybe about two tablespoons lots of salt and pepper you want them to taste great okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes and they're gonna be crisp and sweet and delicious come on to the soup oh this looks so good butternut squash and apples and curry and onions it's gonna be really good soup so I'm going to show you one of my favorite contraptions it's called a food mill and it has a thicker blade and a thinner but or a coarse blade and a fine blade I'm gonna use a coarse blade so you just put it right into the food now have a like a prehistoric food processing I'll put it over a bowl and then it has a a handle like that just pop it in place and then you just use it like that so I'm going to put the soup right through this you probably get a food meal in the hardware store but if you don't have one a food processor or even a blender it's just fine it just ends up being a little more like baby food and you'll see this has a texture to it that I really love okay so what you do it's just process it and goes right through and you have to have the blade go in the opposite direction sort of clean the blade and then it keep going and it just pushes it through that horse blade and you end up with really thick delicious soup and then you just keep going put more soup in one really good thing about this soup is that it's made with water and apple juice which sweetens it most super made with chicken stock so it's vegetarian it's low-fat and it's delicious okay that should do it and the last thing I'm going to put in apple juice until it's exactly the right texture good apple juice you wouldn't really thick but not too thick that it's not like a vegetable puree it's really like soup this looks just about right but just a smooch more the apple juice really adds a great sweetness to this make sure it's good enough for Jeffrey mmm great really good balance of flavors gonna love it they'll think about you all week okay one quart into the fridge and the students are ready for the week you just going to cut a few flowers to the breakfast-table I know it's just breakfast but I still wanted to be special I'm sure it's not true but I have this image of Jeffrey during the week on his own with a bowl of soup over the kitchen sink so the weekends have to be great there years ago I remember reading in a certain old fashion women's magazine if you spend the entire day making dinner for your husband he can't possibly appreciate it enough and it's really not his fault it's your fault and I think it's really good entertaining advice so I try and keep things really simple like this breakfast banana sour cream pancakes just a few little flowers out and he's gonna really appreciate it table settings I love to mix things serve very fancy things like I got these plates in Paris and I love them with very simple things these are dish towels and they make great napkins or I'll use a very nice white damask cloth and very inexpensive like milk bottles that I get at flea markets or yard sales things like that and just simple zinnias they're not fancy flowers but they're perfect and just when Jeffrey thinks it's a morning like any other morning he's gonna have a really nice breakfast except for breakfast with bananas sour cream pancakes I thought it'd be great to have chocolate almond iced coffee who wouldn't like that so I've gotten chocolate almond coffee it smells great and when you make it into iced coffee it's kind of like having ice cream soda for breakfast without the calories so I just made the coffee I'm stunned dripping I'm just going to take the whole pot and put it in the refrigerator and chill it so when you pour it over ice it doesn't get diluted it's really good just like that in the fridge as long as you can so first I'm gonna make some bacon it's a really easy way to do it I just pick something he's really good flavor this is applewood smoked bacon it's really thick cut and this is so easy you won't believe it instead of standing over the stove it in the oven I think your baking sheet this already smells good and what's ever left over can become bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches hmm I think that's what I'm having for lunch into the oven 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes and you can forget about it so now for the best part of the breakfast banana sour cream pancakes mmm so I'm gonna mix the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients separately and then combine them all together a cup and a half of flour just want to lighten the flour a little bit and then measure it like 1 and 1/2 cups that looks pretty good and 3 tablespoons of sugar this has lots of ingredients but it's really worth it 2 teaspoons of baking powder that's one I combined this in a sifter and then if there's anything in the flour that you don't want the pancakes it just sits out 1/2 teaspoons of salt you just sift that all together so it combines it and see that there's a little bit of sugar in the bottom so I'm glad I sifted it okay that's the dry ingredients and now the wet ingredients so the first thing is sour cream is the secret ingredient makes them really moist and flavorful need about 1/2 a cup 3/4 of a cup of milk plus a little extra maybe another tablespoon that's the difference don't ask why I don't know okay next is two eggs I always crack eggs into another ball just in case there's a bad egg or you get a little shell you haven't ruined your pancakes okay now the two best ingredients in this vanilla set one teaspoon teaspoon of lemon zest it's probably my favorite tool in the kitchen it's a microplane probably the least expensive tool in the kitchen I love it but it makes really great lemon zest okay that should do it that teaspoon of lemon zest right on they are then whisk it up so now I'm just gonna mix these two together pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones so they're just combined you don't want to develop the gluten in the flour so just enough and then one last ingredient is the bananas for sharp knife okay I'm gonna chop it up want to make sure the bananas are ripe they don't have to be really really right but just sums in that green a couple of bananas I need take it from the butter in the frying pan and I use a cup measure to measure the pancake spent a quarter of a cup depends on how big you like them we like big pancakes so when I cook these over medium to medium-high heat just until they cook through and you see bubbles on the top so once you see the bubbles on the top you want to put the banana on top got a heaping tablespoon of banana on each pancake this is gushy but good okay now I need my spatula Jeffrey's gonna be a happy camper I'm gonna serve these with hot maple syrup that's great another three minutes and breakfast is ready these are gonna be awesome pancakes I love to heat up the maple syrup it's really good grade-a dark amber syrup as long as you're gonna do it make it good and you heat it up a little bit and I think that bacon smells ready a nice crisp bacon very hot little ice for the glasses for the iced coffee and I think we're ready to put it together it smells so good it makes these having cold cereal for breakfast little bacon looks gorgeous think I made too much bacon now this on top and a little maple syrup all nice and warm and a little confection sugar too much is never enough sweetie breakfast is ready Hey hi babe will you get the coffee I made iced coffee this looks great it's a surprise you somehow right so it's banana sour cream pancakes Wow an applewood smoked bacon lest you think I've been asleep at the switch here this looks amazing does it look good I'm gonna miss you when you've gone all week promised but I made you some dinner so we still think about me I think about you mr. Dwight it's get really wonderful so now I have to do is pack up everything for jeopardy taken Connecticut butternut squash with Apple soup Chinese chicken salad and dressing gonna be very happy camper okay and get it all in and croutons for the suit why do I think he's gonna eat this before he even gets to Connecticut I was dressing for the Chinese chicken salad and his two favorite movies are Chicago and Apollo 13 but I'd say Chicago's way too sexy for a guy on his own so it's Apollo 13 all packed up ready to go I've got all your dinners for you thank you I love you drive carefully okay got my whole life with you go until Friday onions great I'm just gonna let that saute with the onions and the heat really brings out the flavor so while that's cooking away when you get the butternut squash and apples ready that's smells so good that sort of spicy sweetness so butternut squash them I've peeled it I'm just gonna chunk it up coarsely it doesn't have to be any particular dice cuz it's all gonna go into the soup so this is about five pounds of butternut squash I'm just gonna dump it right into the pot and then the next one was the apples so this is my handy dandy vegetable peeler all comes off in one big strip look at that so I need about four peeled apples done okay can really use any kind of sweet apple and I'm just gonna cut them quarters take the cores out chop them up put them right in so these are all going to sit on the stove for about 35 or 40 minutes until the apples and the butternut squash get really soft and then I'm going to puree it and show you how to do it so it has great texture okay that's four apples and now I just need two cups of water and that's all going to cook together in the stove until everything's really tender and flavorful and then I'm going to puree it in a food mill pot and put in the refrigerator and chill it so when you pour it over ice it doesn't get diluted it's really good just like in the fridge as long as you can so first I'm gonna make some bacon I'll show you a really easy way to do it I just pick something has really good flavor this is applewood smoked bacon it's really thick cut this is so easy you won't believe it instead of standing over the stove it in the oven a big baking sheet this already smells good and what's ever left over can become bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches hmm I think that's

ingredients and the wet ingredients separately and then combine them all together cup and a half of flour just want to lighten the flour a little bit and then measure it like one and a half cups that looks pretty good and three tablespoons of sugar this has lots of ingredients but it's in the blade and then it keep going and it just pushes the through that course blade and you end up with really thick delicious soup and then you just keep going put more soup in one really good thing about this soup is that it's made with water and apple juice which sweetens it most soups made with chicken stock so it's vegetarian it's low-fat and it's delicious okay that should do it and the last thing I'm going to put in apple juice until it's exactly the right texture good apple juice you wouldn't really thick but not too thick that it's not like a vegetable puree it's really like soup this looks just about right but just a smidge more the apple juice really has a great sweetness to this make sure it's good enough for Jeffrey mmm great really good balance of flavor it'll look they'll think about you all week okay one quart into the fridge and the students are ready for the week for about ten to fifteen minutes and they're going to be crisp and sweet and delicious and on to the soup oh this looks so good butternut squash and apples and curry and onions it's gonna be really good soup so

be very happy camper okay sip and get it all in and croutons
[Music] now my two rules of entertaining are particularly important in the summer keep it simple I use fresh local ingredients that don't require an enormous amount of cooking to make them taste good and to make it ahead of time so I can have fun at my party I've got a weekend ahead my friends are coming it's good food and I'm ready to have some fun firming shrimp linguini so easy so delicious and assemble dessert that I'm going to buy from the store I'll be experimenting with some cocktails so Geoffrey has fun the minute he walks in the door a classic Manhattan a mai tai that screams summer vacation and a Long Island iced tea which tastes like iced tea but it's really a killer of a drink to go with the drink a great smoked salmon dip peaches and saw tuned for deserved really easy and so delicious Sunday afternoon I'm throwing a beach party with some friends on the menu some delicious barbecued chicken Szechuan noodles broccoli with garlic and soy sauce and taking us back to our childhood s'mores on the fire how delicious is up all that melting chocolate and marshmallows there's so much going on I hope you stay for the whole weekend Jeffery's is coming for a short time this weekend so I want to make every minute count so I'm gonna make a few things ahead and in addition to that I'm having a party tomorrow so I really want to have everything done so I can be out of the kitchen I'm gonna make smoked salmon spread and peaches and Sauternes it's gonna be delicious since it only has two ingredients peaches and Saturn you want to make sure they're both really good and the only way to tell whether peach is good is if it smells like a peach I'm gonna dunk them in boiling water just to take the skins off what you don't want to do is go to the store and squeeze it because wherever you squeeze that you're gonna leave a brown spot so depending on how soft the peaches are it's gonna take between 30 seconds and maybe two minutes for the skins to come off easily and the only way to know is just try one okay they should be done they'll just attempt to put in ice water and then just see the peel comes right off what you don't want to do is cook the peaches so we're gonna take them all out now [Music] okay this one's peeling beautifully see how the skin just sort of falls right off when it's right okay freshest on the piece now great so so I turn we're just that sweet dessert wine that's so wonderful I'm just gonna pour it over it so that's right enough soap marinades in it a little bit of sugar really depends on how sweet the peaches are these pretty sweet so I don't need too much and a splash of Grand Marnier a little depth of flavor so I'm gonna make a little snack for Jeffrey when he comes home tomorrow night smoked salmon spread and then we'll have some fresh peaches and Sauternes afterwards it's not a bad snack but the cream cheese out at room temperature I'm just gonna put it in the mixer 8 ounces of cream cheese about a half a cup of sour cream this is great as a dip with crudité but it's also good as a spread on what slices of baguette and about a tablespoon of lemon juice freshly squeezed lemon juice and then for lots of flavor some fresh dill would be really nice and just chop it up big rough chop okay then tablespoon of fresh dill right into the mixer and a little bit salt and pepper and teaspoon of course radish forget grading her own horseradish it makes me cry right into the mixer and finally smoked salmon can't I smoked salmon dip with that smoked salmon I tend to like a region salmon because it's a little drier and not quite so salty okay four ounces of smoked salmon right into the dip turn the mixer on mix it up that's more salmon dip done and to a nice ball just because it's just a snack for Jeffrey doesn't mean it can't be gorgeous okay into the fridge I've got a really busy day tomorrow so I've got to get my beauty sleep hi guys I think these raspberr is gonna be perfect you're gonna put these on my charge thank you so much [Music] [Music] right now what I need is one bed gap for my smoked salmon spread no they're always nice and fresh out of the oven Oh fantastic and I need some meringues I'm gonna do whipped cream and berries in them this is so good thank you so much will you charge it for me sure yes thank you this is gonna be delicious I'll call you for dinner soon thank you [Music] my philosophy is you don't always need to make something to have a fabulous dessert so I've gotten meringues from loaves and fishes but they just gorgeous the fresh raspberries from the farm stand I'm just gonna whip up a little whipped cream to fill them how bad can that be so I'm just gonna put some heavy cream in the ball and I've got a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment what really cold cream a little sugar everybody likes to flavor whipped cream with vanilla but I like to try different things like rum or this is cassis it's a black currant liqueur and wait to see turns mole and the good news is you have to taste it to make sure it's the right combination it's so good it's like berry flavored whipped cream who wouldn't want that done sometime just gonna assemble them I love a combination of whipped cream because it's creamy and the meringues which are sort of dry and crisp topped with really sweet berries [Music] for dessert that's pretty great isn't it I can't wait for dessert incredible for attempted florists these are look at these only sweet person fabulous so are you in charge of arranging the flowers the turtles flowers I'm making dinner fabulous you need anything buzz the nurse we're right in the kitchen [Music] I'm making linguini with shrimp scampi it's a great summer dish I add oil the pasta pot so that the pasta doesn't stick together and salt for flavor okay that's gonna cook for seven to ten minutes according to the directions on the package so I'm making a centerpiece with hydrangeas I use a knife because a scissor will seal the stem and we want as much water in the flowers as possible [Music] okay three tablespoons of olive oil about three tablespoons of butter I do the olive oil because it is a high burning temperature and the butter because there's lots of flavor I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce of the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than the flavor of garlic so one minute while I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is a peeled and deveined shrimp fish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein it yourself I'm gonna add the pound of shrimp and just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor of the garlic is gonna get into the shrimp so first thing I do is salt-and-pepper the shrimp I'm going to have lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also something really strong with flavor just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides it's so good all that garlic and butter and oil how bad can that be Michaels so great with flowers I can't wait to see what he's doing at the table [Music] so just draining from the Train the water from it and then it's gonna go right into that pan with the shrimp and the garlic and butter and oil it's gonna absorb all that great flavor okay just like that two spoons just toss it all together this is actually a great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and the sauce together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredients are lemon zest lemon juice I like a little bit of heat so just sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and then have two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to you can't really see the lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people aren't gonna eat them but they'll they'll see that it's lemon so I'm gonna add a few slices of lemon to the whole thing before I finish tossing this is really great summer lunch I think Michaels gonna love it it's got so much garlic we never customers who once is six o'clock in the morning yeah so that hurt so save room for dessert so it's meringue with seeds and fresh raspberries I mean how summary is that it cheers to a great summer I'm gonna have to stop eating every Friday night when Jeffery comes home and make him a scotch and a roast chicken well it's time to shake things up a little bit I thought wouldn't it be great when he walks through the front door to have some cocktail for him so I'm gonna try three different cocktails first a Long Island iced tea and it has nothing to do with tea okay so here goes ice cubes into the glass now the liqueur lots of it all in the same quantity start with gin quarter of a cup sort of a cup of vodka and a quarter of a cup of white rum and there's still more next a quarter of a cup of tequila and a quarter of a cup of Cointreau the orange flavored liqueur from France you don't want to drive after you drink this and you want to make sure your guests know how strong it is next time lemon juice half a cup then a teaspoon of sugar syrup give it a stir drop in some ice cubes in a long tall glass and then pour the Long Island iced tea over the rocks tap the glass with a splash of Cola and a slice of lemon on the rim can't wait to try it imagine this on a hot summer day okay so far so good my next experiment is a mai tai which is that summery cocktail you have in the Caribbean on vacation you know with the one that's all loaded up with pineapples and narashino cherries I do draw the line at those little paper umbrellas though okay here goes so lightly beaten egg white and pour it into a flat plate and then dip the rim of the glass of the egg and then into the sugar my eyes make me feel like it's summer on a beach looks great already doesn't it okay the liqueur white rum half a cup into the shaker next a quarter of a cup of triple sec it's another delicious orange flavored liqueur and then some fresh orange juice at a quarter of a cup and for the zing quarter of a cup of fresh lime juice now some ice cubes about six okay now the energetic part starts shaking and then pour the mai tai into a glass over ice and now the decoration is a little old-fashioned but it's required drop the cherries right into the cocktail then a juicy chuck a pineapple on the rim and some orange so there it is strictly for summer and very tropical I can't wait to taste it one more cocktail to go and it's a classic it's a Manhattan always reminds me of roaring 20s it's made from bourbon and sweet vermouth how bad can that be okay so for the Manhattan start with the ice cubes next remove quarter of a cup and bourbon whole Cup and give it all a stir so chilled glasses make this perfect just chill them in the freezer for about 15 minutes and then a maraschino cherry the crowning glory no wonder people have been drinking this cocktail for more than a hundred years now comes the fun part had to taste these cocktails first minute hat looks great doesn't it [Music] whoa that's lethal Jeff you'll never make it through dinner if I serve him that hmm then the Long Island iced tea looks like iced tea actually tastes like iced tea which is amazing and the last one was a mai tai it actually really looks like the Caribbean isn't it that's it it's really good it tastes like fruit juice it's a little more lethal than that but it's gonna feel like a vacation to Geoffrey and it's gonna be great weekend [Music] we could do the sweet peas the hot pink is the color she never seems to buy yeah that's nice what else we can do the pink peonies the slices left over Baghdad and make croutons out of it just see what easy this is someone take the bread just line it up on a sheet pan a little bit of olive oil just a fresh H one on the top with olive oil it's gonna Brown it and it gives it lots of flavor lots of salt you want to have a really good flavor pepper and into the oven 400 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes and we have nice crisp they get slices if we should be home any minute [Music] coffee machines I think that I think this is this is exactly what she would love oh these tests look great nice and crispy I've have lots of flavor wait I think I hear Jeffrey hey sweetie I'm back oh you're gonna make me as present maybe later okay right now [Music] keep our cocktails I brought look what I brought you have no idea how many drinks I had to try in order to get these mai tais so I also made you a little smoked salmon dip oh that looks great fresh peaches and Saturn so why I actually don't we eat in the garden more often I don't know but you know every time if you bring this stuff here [Music] I'm always looking for new ways to cook chicken but nothing says some are more than cooking chicken on a grill and I'm gonna marinate it in barbecue sauce the history of this barbecue sauce is pretty amazing years ago at Barefoot Contessa I asked the chef to make three different kinds of barbecue sauce so we could test them I thought well one should be sort of mustardy one should be tomatoey and one would be maybe chinesey and I don't know when they came out one was to mustardy one was to tomatoey and of course one was to chinesey so I took them home and I thought well let me play with it a little bit and I took all three of them I dumped them in one pot and it was a fabulous barbecue sauce and that's what I've been using for 25 years so it's got a lot of ingredients but it's really worth making so what I've done here is I've sautéed 1 and a half cups of onions and vegetable oil with lots of garlic for about about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and then I'm gonna add all these ingredients 1 cup of tomato paste just like one and a half of these small cans and one cup of cider vinegar it's good it's got some sweetness to it a cup of honey this jar is 16 ounces so I need about half and none if this has to be exact just close one cup of mustard I use good Dijon mustard this is 8 ounces so that should do it one cup of hoisin sauce which is the Chinese part of the recipe and the hoisin sauce is like a plum sauce it's very often used for duck and it's great in this and this jar is 8 ounces so it's just a cup that's the hoisin sauce and then 1/2 a cup of Worcestershire sauce oh I hate these little things that they put on the top so this is 5 ounces so I need most of this jar 1/2 a cup of soy sauce and all this can be just approximately just until it tastes great to you and then lots of great spices so I'm gonna put in 2 tablespoons of chili powder it's gonna add lots of spice to it 2 tablespoons of chili powder not quite that much 1 tablespoon of cumin which is sort of a tex-mex Spike's and half a tablespoon of really hot red pepper flakes and you can make this as hot as you want but it's sort of hot but not really huh so I'm just gonna simmer this for about 30 minutes until all the flavors blend together - bet Jeffrey has to go to work we know how much he loves chicken how I am about buying things for party rather than making them ice creams a perfect example why bother making it I'd love to start with good vanilla ice cream lots of toppings and I end up with a dessert that everybody loves so I'm taking vanilla ice cream with great simple toppings it turns grown-ups into fun stirs it works every time I thought I'd make fresh raspberry sauce over vanilla ice cream it's four ingredients and it takes less than ten minutes to make how good is that so start by cooking the raspberries pour them into a pan half a pint of luscious ripe berries is just the right amount and then the sugar half a cup now some water quarter of a cup in the pan turn off the heat okay so that's boiling now now lower the heat and let it simmer for four minutes so while that cooks pulling out a cup of raspberry jam you want seedless raspberry jam because the fresh fruit will have enough seeds in it but after the bowl of the food processor it's been fitted with a steel blade knife Renoir's it's a clear raspberry flavored brandy that you can find in the litter store so now pour in the raspberries and switch the machine on once the sauce were really smooth great that's perfect when you're ready to serve dessert just spoon some of the sauce over scoops of vanilla ice cream and I promise you everyone will be in heaven and no one will know that it took you just 10 minutes to make this sauce is also great with the rags it's wonderful for entertaining because you can make it a day or two in advance here's another idea and it couldn't be easier it's Italian it's called affogato it's a scoop of vanilla ice cream with hot espresso poured over it it's hot and it's cold and absolutely delicious so first things first make the espresso everyone's got their own machine - now how yours works I'm using one Jeffrey got me follow the instructions and the amounts for your machine but make sure you use espresso coffee art won't be unduly authentic if you don't have an espresso maker you can just buy prepared espresso from the coffee shop and then just heat it up before dessert so get your ice cream ready when the clock is hot work right over the ice cream it's as simple as that boom the mix of cold vanilla ice cream and piping hot espresso they melt together it's absolutely sublime well it's too early in the morning for ice cream but Geoffrey like it definitely is a cup of espresso I can't believe you're gonna miss our party I know it's gonna be really fun we save me something yeah I'm having barbecued chicken your favorite Oh I'll save you some where are you gonna cook it on the beach of course oh I'm sorry I'm gonna miss all that sand in here right [Music] can't wait to get to the beach everybody's there lighting the grill getting everything ready I'm just gonna marinate the chicken so I'm just gonna put it in the bowl I always smell chicken to make sure it's fresh so just gonna pour some marinade over it one thing you want to do though is make sure it's cold can actually combine the chicken and the marinade overnight and see these data so I'm just gonna layer it all together smudge it all around it's a technical term smudge so that's the chicken in the marinade okay chicken hands definitely want to wash these okay into the fridge with a chicken we're gonna have a great barbecue later [Music] so to go with a barbecue chicken I'm gonna make Szechuan noodles sort of tex-mex meets Asian fusion so the first thing I do is cook the pasta and actually instead of using Chinese noodles I use Italian dry pasta really it sort of works better this is fettuccine you can use spaghetti any kind of pasta like that was just great this has lots of great ingredients but it also has lots of flavor first thing is six cloves of garlic all chopped up right into the food processor okay next thing is ginger this is what ginger looks like it's a very sort of gnarly but what you want to do is with a sharp knife peel it and then chop it up and it's got great flavor I need a better quarter of a cup chopped up okay just chop this up sort of roughly it's gonna get really pureed in the food processor so it doesn't have to be perfect chopped up nice okay about a quarter of a cup into the food processor okay now all these things from the pantry mostly we probably already have half a cup of vegetable oil half a cup of tahini which is sesame paste it's sort of middle-eastern you can find it you can't find it the grocer sure you probably can you can certainly find in a specialty store okay have a cup have a cup of peanut butter I mean how bad can a sauce be if it's got peanut butter in it so about a half a cup of this this looks like really good peanut butter half a cup of soy sauce this is really all the salt in it plus lots of other flavor and then a quarter of a cup of honey that's about a quarter of a cup let's see it doesn't have to be exact quarter of a cup of dry sherry this is from the liquor store that should do it quarter of a cup of sherry vinegar mmm I love the smell that it's great and vinaigrettes too that should do it two tablespoons of sesame oil you don't want the clear one you want the one that smells like really roasted sesame seeds it's a dark sesame oil there's so much flavor and now comes the heat I'm gonna add cayenne pepper just a pinch just enough to give it some heat Asian chili oil which is really hot whoa and some black pepper and that should do it that's it it's thick it looks so delicious I can smell the ginger and the garlic it's gonna be great but I think the pasta is ready just done [Music] okay save me something later and then toss it together with the hot noodles it's actually great to have the sauce on the hot noodles it really absorbs the flavor and every little extra sauce because as the noodles cool or the pasta cools it's gonna absorb more sauce and now we're gonna add some other great Asian ingredients sliced scallions as much as you like yellow peppers red peppers so it's great because it's pasta and it's wonderful sauce and it's vegetables and it's gonna be so good with barbecued chicken I think a little extra skin ions I'll do it perfectly on this so I'm just slicing on the diagonal and ready for the beach [Music] anybody want a drink so my friends are at the beach I've one thing left to do broccoli with garlic broccoli is cooking away and what I've done is I've cooked garlic whole cloves of garlic and oil for about 15 minutes the garlic is perfectly tender and then the oil is infused with a garlic flavor it's great you add a little heat to it some red peppers this is great for a picnic and just put it in containers and everybody can eat it at the beach okay that's gonna sit for a minute so the broccoli should be just about done just gonna blanch it for about 2 or 3 minutes so it's really just tender but still crisp like a salad and it should be just done right now so it's gonna go right into ice water I want to stop the cooking immediately it's called shocking and what its gonna do is stop the cooking and also set the color so it's gonna be bright green nobody wants to eat brown broccoli salad okay just for a minute until it's cool then I'm gonna drain it and then put a sauce on trying it really well coz when the broccoli is dry it will hold much more of the sauce okay right into a bowl and now what I'm gonna do is just add some of the garlic oil a little bit of the world tossed around it just enough to flavor it the whole cloves of garlic which are actually really sweet when they're cooked like this that looks pretty good and since we have an Asian thing going I thought maybe instead of salt I'd use a little soy sauce on it just a few tablespoons toss it all together and how easy is that already for the beach [Music] [Music] anyway you go to a beach party and everybody is on their own blanket I don't feel like I'm at the same party I think it's so much nicer to all be together at one big party so I've gone out and gotten sort of straw window shades all kinds of wacky things inexpensive pillows that I got on sale and we can all be together at the table in the middle and we're really comfortable hey it's a great way to have a party [Music] so he's marinating this for Oh a couple of hours and you don't have to cook the chicken at all before you feed em I just put it on the grill you know the key is not making sure that the grill is far enough away from the coals the outside doesn't burn before the chicken cooks the friend of mine says it's not a barbecue until the fire department shows so we have some Szechuan noodles and broth so we have that welded chicken cooks Szechuan noodles and broccoli guess where I got it the Chinese takeout place they're very social I see the chickens ready it's just cooking away here we need something put it right there plates napkins just put on one big play [Music] anybody want barbecue [Laughter] [Laughter] as in anytime you have marked out people will follow you anywhere right that's true right okay so I'm gonna have to make some more okay so we have you can just use regular stick so we have fancy sticks okay so everybody gets large manila do you do one or two so two marshmallows on the fire which really that's the only thing you learned in girls standing up refusal right [Laughter] I'd say this awards are great there's not a picnic without the sand
it's Friday Geoffrey's coming home tonight just when it's expecting yet another birth chicken I always like to shake it up a little bit so making an old-fashioned Jewish dinner with brisket carrots onions to be really good well that's a big piece of me for two people but it's like making a beef stew it lasts forever and you can reheat it they're making brisket for do big booklet I'll show you how easy it is I'm going to make a rub for the top two tablespoons of salt I know it seems like a lot of salt it's a big piece of brisket 20 tablespoon of garlic chopped up garlic 2 teaspoons of dried oregano and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper smoosh that all together and then rub it on top of the brisket okay that's appropriately smushed together I'm just going to sprinkle it on the top and then rub it in briskets a great cut of stewing meat to buy when you go to the store make sure you don't buy a corned beef brisket which is the same cut that's already been processed with spices and salt okay that's done I'm going to put on a pound of carrots just chop them up in chunks it's going to stew a long with these would be really good these are big carrot chips how to carrots can be anything from two big carrots to five small ones okay and then eight stalks of celery let's cut off the ends a little bit the brown ends and then just cut it and Chuck remember this goes to four three and a half hours so okay and onions I've got six onions sliced all over the top this already looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't it and some bay leaves for flavor these are beautiful babies six how's that okay and then I'm going to pour good tomato juice all over the top of it just enough to come up about three-quarters of the way up the beef so just pour it right on top and this is going to make the sauce after it cooks okay now we're just going to cover it and bake it so I'm going to cover it with aluminum foil but first because I don't want the foil to touch the tomato juice it reacts really badly I'll either cover it with plastic wrap or parchment paper into the oven 350 degrees for about three and a half hours it's fork-tender so that was pretty fast for dinner that could see probably ten people but for tonight insist everything [Music] briskets vegetables the whole meal in one

[Music] for 20 years I ran a specialty food store so I know how hard the retail business is doriel Turk one's a wonderful store in East Hampton called Calypso and she's asked me to cater a party to thank her employees the owner Cristian is French so I thought wouldn't it be fun to do a very French dinner for them to start I'm making a Provencal vegetable soup that's packed with flavor and topped with a spoonful of garlic tomato and basil piece du which is like a French version of pesto and for the main course spectacular seafood platter piled high with succulent cooked lobsters giant shrimp blue claw crabs fresh clams and raw oysters dessert coconut Medlin's shell shaped pancakes filled with sweet coconut and served with coffee Dorie is sending a table smack in the middle of the store and if I don't start making the soup they'll never have dinner promise all soup au pistou is one of my favorite soups a really hearty vegetable soup I'm gonna make it today as the first course before dinner but it's also great just as a lunch in front of the fireplace on a cold winter day so I'm gonna start with onions as a lot of soups do I've got two yellow onions chopped and two tablespoons of olive oil and I just cooked them for about five to ten minutes until they're translucent and I'm gonna add some potatoes potatoes are great in this because they sort of thicken it the starch and them cooks into it and forget peeling them the outside of the skin is just great it's got lots of nutrients and it's perfectly delicious in the soup this is a really chunky soup so you want to cut the vegetables maybe about a half inch cubes and then you get really the full flavor and texture of each of the vegetables but you can also add other things like zucchini or whatever vegetables you have around okay into the pot with potatoes I'm just gonna saute them a little bit as each of the vegetables it's done chopping put it right in okay next the carrots so with carrots I have a better pound of carrots at the narrow end I just cut it off like that and then when you get to the wider part just cut it in half it's important for the vegetables to all be about the same size so they cook it about the same time and right into the pot so I saw tail the vegetables together first and then and lots of stock and it would be a really thick delicious soup so these are leeks if you've seen them in the grocery store they're really a mild onion flavor and they very often have a lot of sand in them so you want to cut them right down the middle and wash them incredibly carefully pull everything apart there's no point in making a super piece - only to find out that there's sand in it do that so I need about 2 cups of leeks which depending on the size of the leeks is two three four leeks something like that and you want to cut the just the white and the light green parts there should be about two cups I'm just gonna put them right in if you're not sure that all the sand is out what you want to do is just put them in a sieve and then just wash it through the water again one more time but these are good and cleaned just saute all this together okay now I just need salt and pepper why don't I have tablespoons of salt and a lot of this depends on how salty your chicken stock is mine's homemade so it's not too salty and one teaspoon of pepper so there's no saute these for about five minutes until they start to get sort of a little tender on the outside and now I need a really important ingredient for super piece to saffron saffron it's one of my favorite spices it's really elegant because it's got great depth of flavor it's the stamens of a particular crocus that's found in Spain and Turkey mostly and it's gonna be delicious in the soup it gives it a great spice I need about a teaspoon of saffron first I'm gonna pour in three quarts of chicken stock I've heated it a little bit but [Music] just stir that around turn up the heat so it simmers and now teaspoon of saffron so I'm gonna let that simmer for about thirty minutes just below the boiling point after I'm finished making this dinner I'm gonna pack it all up and send it over to the store where Dori is the manager she's a fabulous sense of design and I'm sure she's doing a gorgeous table [Music] joy what do you think about using one of these antiques is honest I think it's still perfect that's great and the light table cloth underneath really stands it out it gives it a little pop [Music] so prevalence elsu pocus do is classically served with a dollop of pea stew on the top which is very similar to pesto but it's a provençal style instead of having pin yoli's and has tomato paste in it but it has all of that sort of garlic and basil fresh taste to it so I need four cloves of chopped garlic and actually since it's going in the food processor I don't have to be chopped that much right in with a steel plate I'm going to add a quarter of a cup of tomato paste if you're really rich tomato flavor lots of fresh basil but the minors are the full you're right and then I need 1/2 a cup of olive oil just going to pour it right in the top just like making that stuff and the last ingredient freshly grated Parmesan cheese stump again post it to mix it you've got these two I'm just gonna save it for later put it in a container so each bowl of soup is gonna have a big dollop he's still on the top the lid on and it's ready to be sent to the store okay I'm gonna finish the soup and then I'm gonna make coconut medlab so just two more quick things to do for my provençal super loose - I'm going to put in string beans and pasta so the string these are these French string beans they're very small you can really find them almost anywhere now just do them in big groups you don't have to do every single one individually we're not looking for perfection here we're looking for delicious I put the string beans in in the last 10 or 15 minutes of making the soup because you don't want them to get overcooked you want mushy string beans so they'll still have a lot of fresh flavor and bright green color this soup au pistou is gonna be just delicious with a seafood main course it's a really rich and hearty and it'll go beautifully with the lightening course so right into the soup and then the last thing is dried pasta I'm gonna use a quarter of pound of spaghetti and again you don't want big long strands so I'm just gonna break it into parts just break it into like thirds or quarters just put it right in the soup and this is all gonna cook together for about 10 or 15 minutes until the pasta is tender the string beans are done and you've got a rich thick vegetable soup I think the guys in the store will love it okay well the tables basically done so we'll use these meatballs with the texture on them to give it a little rough element right and how about these shells for the smooth and they're nice and shiny and then also we have the wood to give it a little natural element as well so we can incorporate all our textures perfect my lens are a classic little French pancake that are made in the shape of a shell they usually plain but I thought I'd do a twist on them and make them with coconut so I'm making coconut neck lens they're often served with tea actually dipped in tea but since I'm making it nice French dinner I thought they'd be delicious for deserved so three eggs and to the mixer 2/3 of a cup of sugar if you want to make a classic Madeleine leave the coconut out and do a little bit of lemon zest and it's delicious and a teaspoon of good vanilla extract vanilla I'm gonna just beat this on medium speed for about three minutes until it gets really light and fluffy and in the meantime I'm gonna mix the dry ingredients so 1 cup of flour put a good cup of cornstarch this makes it more like a cake flour half a teaspoon of baking powder and according to teaspoon of salt and just get those together right okay so this is nice and light and fluffy I'm just gonna lower the speed and add a quarter pound of butter that's been melted not hot because you don't want to cook the eggs there's melted and cooled that's what makes me that one so moist and delicious and then still on low speed just gonna add the mixture of flour and cornstarch and salt mix it together very quickly less than a third of a cup of coconut okay and then the coconut just stir it in with a spatula I've got two pans that I brushed with melted butter and dusted with flour this should make I think about 20 Madeline's the flour and the butter stops the Medlin's from sticking so you want just one rounded tablespoon of batter in each one just do sort of like an oval shape if you take your spoon and just run along the edge you'll end up with a nice oval shape and then each bad level be the same size I have to say I'm really not big on having something where you need a special pin just for that item he's specialized baking equipment and cooking equipment but there's something about Medlin's that I just adore and if you made these in another pan and just be little pound cakes in order to be Medlin's they really have to be the classic shell shape and they're really not very expensive you can find them in almost any bakeware store in America so we bake these at 375 for about 10 to 12 minutes until they're golden on the outside and just moist and delicious inside you could serve this with a glass of sherry but tonight they're gonna be delicious with a cup of coffee so coconut Midlands for dessert hmm next I'm gonna make the seafood platter wait you see this it's wonderful [Music] so for the main course for the store dinner I'm gonna make something so easy and so spectacular you'll be really surprised it's based on a traditional French seafood dish it's all one big platter with crushed ice lobsters shrimp crab meat and fresh oysters so the first thing I wanna make is a mignonette sauce which is the traditional thing served with raw oysters it's really quick I need 3/4 of a cup of white wine or champagne vinegar the shallots 1 tablespoon of sugar and I'm just gonna cook that for together for about a minute over medium heat and then I'm gonna have lots of fresh herbs to it I've asked my friend Ellen to take everything to the store for me so all they have to do is get the table ready okay that's done now for some fresh herbs I have parsley dill and chives for my garden okay rough chop these gives it a really fresh taste so you have a piece of dry Breton one and maybe a little butter and a roll i stir a little tablespoon of mignonette sauce on it in the other hand and you're happening okay one tablespoon of chopped green herbs right into the mignonette sauce and that's done okay the next thing I'm gonna make is a really easy mustard sauce for the rest of the seafood the lobster the shrimp and the crab meat ina sent me a task list so all I have to do now is find a place for the platters and the hot plate Odori what do you think about adding some pillows those chairs I think that's a great idea get a little more comfortable definitely I love the orange one well that's pretty I like the green one too oh yeah that's good you're nice and cozy for our guests they can just mix and match they don't have to be perfect great well it looks really cozy what a good idea to have a dinner party at the shop this looks beautiful I'm so glad that we don't have to cook me too I'm sure a nice meal will be great let me know I'm ready to party fantastic so for the second sauce my seafood platter I'm gonna make a mustard mayonnaise sauce we're just really easy I need one and a half cups of mayonnaise let's see this 16-ounce jar so I need about 3/4 of it perfect I need 3 tablespoons of Dijon mustard and 1 tablespoon of whole-grain mustard because I love the flavor and the texture and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and how's that for a fast sauce just mix it all together and this would be really good with a lobster and the shrimp give a little sour cream and you want to add that you can but just the way it is perfect so have a classic mignonette sauce for the oysters and a creamy mustard sauce for lobster crab meat and shrimp and then put them both into French porcelain dishes so that can be served at the table and next I'm going to assemble the French seafood platter just because a French seafood platter looks elegant doesn't mean it's hard to make this is what you see in French bistros and the secret is if the seafood shop took everything so I'm filling a big spot you can do a platter or a dish low dish if you have a big white platting just fill it with crushed ice if you can't find crushed ice at this party store is a liquor store then wherever you get sodas you can go to the seafood shop and sometimes they'll still have somewhere on you can buy it so just fill that with crushed ice keep all the seafood nice and cold I got lobsters that are already cooked and I have them split so it's six halves for five people that's great crabs which I cut in half [Music] and lots of really big shrimp peeled and deveined they're cooked and I would like to tell the seafood shop to leave the tails on they have something to hold one of group things put all the shrimp together all the crab together otherwise it tends to look like a dog's breakfast it's a mess and then we have oysters and clams just put them right on tonight they're so fresh and they're so bright and it smell like the sea just pile them up what it really packed the raw clams just on the half-shell okay pack as many as I can in and then I'm gonna do some fresh lemons not too fancy just really casual when I serve these with mustard sauce and the Medianet sauce for the oysters I'm so good and then I bribe bread with butter and some tomatoes that I sliced and I think I may need a little bit of salt and pepper a drizzle of olive oil and I would say that's not a bad French dinner it's wonderful the pasta makes it Hardy Wow [Applause] beautiful oh what's in there looks like lobsters and crabs clams oysters those shrimp oh my goodness delicious not a few much really it is to be amazing does anybody else want some mustard mayonnaise for the seafood this is so wonderful this is the meal I've been waiting for all summer [Music] you know fresh oysters a little rye bread some salted butter and a little of the mignonette sauce to go on anyone want a mandolin thank you they're delicious I love the hint of coconut in them oh great good with the coffee too here's to our team and here's to ina for the great meal I hope they're enjoying their face as much as I'm enjoying mine super
[Music] just because I have a really busy day doesn't mean that Canada my friends for an elegant dinner just takes a little planning and a really easy menu that I can make ahead my friend Miguel has offered to do the table perfect and we've invited his friend Jack they've just moved into the neighborhood to start I'm gonna make a cold zucchini vichyssoise that I can make early in the day then Asian grilled salmon that's full of flavor quickly sauteed asparagus and sugar snap peas and for dessert a warm pair clafouti served with a dollop of creme fraiche this is just the kind of evening at home with friends that I really love from midweek party when I want to make everything a head soup is a great first course this is a particularly good one because I'm gonna serve it cold it's vichyssoise and I've done it with a little bit of a twist with fresh zucchini in it so the first thing I have is five cups of leeks I use the white and light green parts so take a little bit of butter and olive oil and then I'm gonna cut up potatoes and zucchini and put them right into the pan so use these little small hole boiling potatoes where the skins on and everything makes it really easy and I find really sort of tender ones so eight eight of these and I'm leaving the skins on the potatoes because I'm gonna put it through food mill and that'll take the skins out easier I made this the first time actually in France I was in the market myself beautiful potatoes and zucchini ax but put this together in a suit so the next thing when I cut up is the zucchini really rough chop this it's all gonna get pureed [Music] okay pour in six cups of chicken stock if you have homemade chicken stock is great if not this can turn the heat up a little bit until it simmers I'm just going to cook these vegetables for about 30 minutes until all the vegetables and potatoes are tender and then I'm going to puree it little touch of cream of gorgeous cold soup for dinner tonight [Music] so since I'm making a cold soup I thought it'd be really nice to make a warm dessert so I'm gonna make something called a clafouti which is like a pancake batter over fruit it's a French country dessert it's really great and so easy to make so I'm gonna start with 3 eggs and 1/3 of a cup of sugar this really is like making a pancake batter it's that easy and then I'm gonna refrigerate it and later I'm going to put pears in the bottom of a dish and then pour the batter over it right into the oven before dinner so I'm gonna mix this until quite and fluffy about a minute or two we wanna zest a lemon my handy-dandy zester love it here's a lemon or great combination together sort of sweet and tart at the same time okay I'm still trying to mix it down a little bit now the next ingredient is one and a half cups of cream well two teaspoons of good vanilla extract six tablespoons of flour which is actually a quarter of a cup is four tablespoons two more teaspoon of lemon zest remember you want to just get the bright yellow zest you don't want to need the white part quarter teaspoon of salt and the last ingredient is pear brandy which really enhances the flavor of the pears it's wonderful it's most still like pears and sometimes you can find it it has the pear in the bottle and what they've done is they've tied the bottle on the tree around the little flower that's gonna grow the pear and it grows in the bottle it's amazing to see a whole tree filled with bottles but it really adds wonderful flavor two tablespoons of pear brandy and that's it it really is like a pancake batter it's sort of thin and but when you pour it over the pears it's just wonderful cliff food is usually made with cherries sort of more traditional French countryside dessert but I really love it with pears so it's done I'm gonna refrigerator they've been refrigerated for as long as you want just like pancake batter and then later I'm gonna cut pears into a pan pour the batter over it into the oven we're gonna have a really gorgeous warm dessert be great [Music] and next I'm gonna make my favorite Asian marinated salmon and really simple sauteed sugar snap peas asparagus so the vegetables are all cooked in the vichyssoise the potatoes and zucchini and leeks and I'm gonna put it through the food mill you can always puree this in a food processor or a blender but I just think it ends up with a really gorgeous thick texture when it's done in a food mill and nobody wants to eat baby food so much better when you can really have a sense of the texture just best truth so around you one direction to puree it and then the other direction to clean it I'm kidding this is gonna be nice this is a great soup because it can be hot it can be cold you can freeze it for later so when you're not really sure like in the summer sometimes it's chilly at night you want to serve it hot just heat it up at the last minute I actually think it's one of my favorite pieces of equipment in the kitchen it's great for pureeing vegetables or for making soups and just really end up with a great texture i'm the good news is you can usually get in the hardware store okay that's it just make sure you get what's on the bottom it's really good okay a little touch of cream at the end just a few tablespoons gives a really nice extra flavor here just tasted for season these it's really good it's wonderful you can really taste suck all the fresh vegetables the zucchini a little bit of salt a little bit of heat I'm gonna chill it ass gonna be so delicious before the salmon for dinner [Music] next is Asian grilled salmon I can't tell you how many times I've made this and I guarantee you it's really easy this also elegant it's gonna start with a nice piece of Sanders beautiful center cut [Music] the idea of this recipe is I'm gonna make a marinade pour half of it over the salmon and then after the Salmons grilled pour the other half over so it becomes both a marinade and a sauce and it keeps it really moist and flavorful so I'm gonna cut five or six slices just make sure you get all the way through the skin this is clearly too much for three people but when I'm making Asian grilled salmon it's so good as leftovers both just from temperature but also in a salad that I always make extra and take these slices and just put them in a dish I'm gonna marinate them in this is about 3 pounds of salmon you want to figure about a half a pound per person okay now I'm gonna make a marinade so I have half a teaspoon of fresh chopped garlic in the ball gives a nice bite and the 2 tablespoons of good Dijon mustard that's about two tablespoons three tablespoons of good soy sauce this is the Asian part of the Asian marinated salmon and six tablespoons of good olive oil I [Music] like California olive oil I think it's got a good flavor but it's not too strong for the sauce the whole idea of this sauce is to make that the salmon taste better it's not to overpower it so it has lots of flavor but it's not really really snot running a flavored I'm just gonna whisk this together [Music] this sauce particularly great because the mustard emulsifies it so we're just going to pour half on spread it down okay great I've got the salmon done ready to grill I've got the batter done for the pair of clafouti I've got the soup done and now I'm gonna go off to the afternoon and Miguel's gonna come and do the table he's the perfect guest [Music] I'm telling you go under okay [Music] I think I recognize those shoes hey how are you what are you up to well love that you come and do the table settings I mean how does the girl get that walkie what I'm trying to do a little bit of a flower arrangement and I couldn't find it a frog okay so making this grid with scotch tape see this is the way you hold the flowers what a great idea I love this I'm loves lilac smells so famous and actually you think of it what the flowers is being white but you never think of the buds is being lime green is that great but I'll Camilla and roses this is gonna be core just to find out you it's gonna be gorgeous we'll try it so I'm gonna go work on dinner right I'm gonna leave you to this okay so Miguel's next-door doing the table his friend Jack is coming in about a half an hour and I'm gonna pull everything together for dinner I'm gonna start finishing the pair clafouti so I've got two or three pairs you want them firm but still smell like pairs and these are just gorgeous Bartlett pears so what I've done is I've prepared the dish I buttered it and then dusted it with sugar instead of flour makes a nice base for the pears so I've got one pair and I think too because these are so big should be fine you can really use any kind of just flavorful fruit in this apples pears okay so I'm just going to cut these in quarters and then slice them right into the dish I'm just going to slice this country each one of these they're just holding it all together put it into the dish and just fan it out a little bit remember it's gonna sort of peek through the batter so you want it to be really pretty just like that [Music] so these pears are a little firm but they're also very juicy so that's really what you want then Lily just before the pancake batter right over it just mix it up a little bit it smell a pear brandy and mr. Harris just wonderfully vanilla I'm just gonna bake this whole thing 375 about 35 or 40 minutes until it's puffed and golden and gorgeous and I'm going to serve it warm a little bit of cream [Music] secret to cooking salmon really well is make sure the grill pan is really hot and it is so I'm gonna put it on I start skin side down but I like to do it on a diagonal I think it looks better that way really hot open the windows turn on the fan did you do it on the grill too but today I'm just gonna do it inside okay five minutes on this side I'm going to flip it over five minutes on the other side and so we've just gorgeous so with the Asian grilled salmon I thought be really nice to do some sauteed vegetables and since sugar snap peas and asparagus are in season sort of late spring early summer they're great combination so just cut off the ends I actually like to cut these on the diagonal I think they look better great already so I'm just gonna heal the pan you want it nice and hot just add some olive oil in want the olive oil really hot women vegetables hit the pan so sugar snap peas these are gonna cook for about five or ten minutes until they're identical which is cooked through but still a little crispness salt kosher salt or sea salt pepper I think this needs a little bit of heat so I'm gonna have some crushed red pepper flakes just toss them together just cook them over medium-low heat five to ten minutes I'm gonna go check the family is of just half done perfectly return them [Music] Sibley fan [Music] unless you cook for another five to seven minutes until they're just a little bit raw on the inside and then they'll keep cooking until I'm ready to serve [Music] [Music] Asian grilled salmon is just done perfect so you can either take the skin off or not but I think it's just fine with the skin on fill you up - you turn it over on this plate I'm turning it over particularly looks nice that way but I want the sauce to get into the you need it fast and it's the hot and messy job I think four pieces of the perfect four [Music] okay I'm just gonna put the rest of the sauce on keeps the fish really moist and flavorful don't use the marinade from the raw fish [Music] sugar snap pea asparagus perfect sort of crisp and tender MF de flavor wonderful a little more salt that's a vegetable and cold zucchini vichyssoise that's great I would say this meal is so elegant they'll never know was easy a little bit of chive on the soup [Music] and I would say dinner is served [Music] Miguel zucchini vichyssoise Oh jack you good Khonsu friend are you pulled together such an elegant dinner party thank you well I wish I gotta say I had cooks and working and servers and I did it all myself really didn't take more than about an hour it's great hey I told you never get disappointed here prepare clafouti for dessert Wow I know it's weak ales particular favorite exactly same house making a pumpkin course as easy as making a pancake with pear brandy in it Oh Josh now that you know make dinner parties during the week please come back of course usually it's Chinese takeout [Laughter]
nothing a beach picnic and I'm going to bring shrimp salad pasta pesto and peas and my favorite lemon cake transports really well to the beach I'm going to show you how to make this if you can make this lemon cake you can make any cake I've got room-temperature butter half a pound and 2 cups of sugar that I've been mixing in the mixer until it's really light and fluffy then I'm going to add four room-temperature eggs I'm going to add the eggs one at a time and just let them get incorporated into the butter and sugar okay the next I'm going to put in is 1/3 of a cup of grated lemon zest and that's goes in wonderful okay then I have to put together my dry ingredients and wet ingredients first the wet ingredients I have a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice that I've squeezed buttermilk which is great it's a low-fat milk that's got a culture in it so 1/4 cup of lemon juice that's 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk and the next thing is vanilla you love the smell of vanilla I figure out how to put it into almost every big product so teaspoon of vanilla now the dry ingredients so that's three cups of flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt salt surprisingly important in baking things really brings out the lemon and the lemon cake and I'm just going to sift these together sifting really combines it but it also makes sure that there's nothing in the bottom I want to put them in alternately starting and ending with the dry ingredients just until it's mixed and then add the wet ingredients this keeps the batter from getting too thick or too runny and it keeps it really light great thing about this recipe is it's in fact better the next day so if you're having a party it's really great to make it in advance and then the last flour so that's it I've got the dry ingredients of wet ingredients and I'm just going to give it one more mix with a spatula make sure it's really well mixed smell the first ball wonderful just one more mix with a spatula okay I've got two baking pans that I've greased and floured and a little piece of parchment paper on the bottom so there's no point in making a delicious cake if you can't get it out of the pan divide this up evenly that looks good even right looks good so they're going to bake 350 degrees for about 40 to 45 minutes and after they come out I have a simple syrup made of lemon juice and sugar and the drizzle on the top and it's soaks in and it just has such a fresh lemon flavor and it keeps it incredibly moist
hi I'm Ina Garten my husband Jeffrey and I are having a vacation in Napa we've rented the house he's gonna work at his book which he loves to do and I'm gonna have a food adventure it's a gorgeous day in app and I'm cooking California style I'm making roasted asparagus and prosciutto with easy hollandaise then I've got a date with a fabulous Tyler Florence who's sharing his secrets for making the perfectly cooked porterhouse steak from there I'm heading down to San Francisco to the Ferry Building to shop for a sunset picnic and a vineyard Jeffrey's bringing the wine and I'm bringing the easiest no cook picnic its Barefoot Contessa California style you come to San Francisco a lot and every morning I have to get up and walk down Market Street right to the Ferry Building I get myself a cup of coffee and I sit out and watch the fairies and I think one I live in San Francisco it's hard to imagine now but ten years ago this building was almost derelict we rebuild it so beautifully and now it's an incredible food hall filled with local artisans love shopping here these are the biggest radishes I've ever seen they'll be perfect a little baby arugula I love hothouse English cucumbers because there ceases and you don't need to peel them oh these looks so delicious really sweet 485 interchange you so much I've got you I'm assembling a picnic I'm meeting Jeffrey in a vineyard in Napa at sunset and putting together a no cook picnic I've got so much more shopping to do now this has to be the garden spot of the world I mean it's this Napa Valley right in the middle of the vineyards I'm gonna do a really casual dinner big board lots of delicious things that I bought in San Francisco and the best thing is Geoffrey's bringing the wine it's a no cook pigment with a food painting a beautiful picture on the board I keep things really simple I don't even unwrap the hard cheese I like to do large groupings of things so radishes with their leaves and tomatoes in their box look great together chutney and mustard comes straight out of the jar the sopressata stacked right in the corner makes a beautiful edge height is important too so the arugula is piled up and the bread is too and keeping it rustic the creamy cheese is just cut in half makes a great focal point and that's it my vineyard picnic perfect timing as always and you brought the wine of course I brought the what you bring what is this Chateau garden I love it did you make it yes Wow and do you love it it was fabulous there's a fabulous experience here try this oh how fantastic to guard who made the wine that's amazing give a new career get professor and you know what I did I made a picnic out of all kinds of things that I got in the San Francisco armours market just help yourself this may be the best picnic I've ever seen
[Music] my husband Jeffrey is so generous with me he's always buying me the most extravagant gifts for my birthday but when it comes to his birthday he likes things very low-key so I'm combining three of his favorite things for dinner tonight in his honor rose chicken great friends and the beach first I'm marinating a boneless butterfly chicken to cook on the grill plus skewers of savory cherry tomatoes and on the side crisp broccolini with balsamic vinaigrette and for dessert Jeffrey's favorite mixed berry pavlova a cloud of meringue whipped cream and berries my friends Frank and Susan are helping at the beach and if I'm lucky I can keep it all a secret from the birthday boy [Music] so for Geoffrey's surprise party I thought I'd make something different chicken well the surprise is a different kind of chicken I'm gonna make a butterfly chicken I'm gonna do it with lots of herbs and then grill it it's gonna be so good so what I have is a butterfly chicken that I asked the butcher to take all the bones out the wings the legs so it's completely flat and now I'm gonna make a rosemary and lemon marinade for it it's gonna be nice cuz it marinates for a while in the refrigerator and then when it goes on the grill it has all those wonderful flavors of rosemary and lemon but also the charcoal so the first thing I need is a quarter of a cup of fresh rosemary leaves I'm just gonna chop them up the key to this recipe is that I'm gonna make it an herb marinade that goes underneath the skin so it's gonna flavor the chicken the skin and they're gonna roll it up around fresh rosemary leaves and lemons and so the skin and the chicken meat is really flavored chickens pretty bland as it becomes so I love to do something really special to make it taste great they gonna chop up rosemary leaves pretty finely cuz they're pretty tough they're not it's not a tender leaf like a basil leaf really small mints okay so it's a quarter of a cup of rosemary leaves chopped so to measure the whole leaves and then chop them perfect seven into the bowl and then garlic's rosemary and garlic classic combination three cloves of garlic garlic gives it a little heat which is good and the best part of the butterfly chicken you can just put it on a board when it's cooked and just slice it you don't have to deal with all those bones into the bowl the zest of half a lemon I love these combination of flavors lemon garlic rosemary about a teaspoon of grated lemon zest and the juice of half a lemon [Music] [Applause] one and a half tablespoons okay want to have tablespoons of olive oil two teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper okay I'm just gonna mix it all together okay so that's the marinade pull the chicken right up here so when I do this marinade is put it underneath the skin that's really where it has the most flavor so just take your fingers and just run it right between the skin and the meat there's a few connective tissues you want to just get rid of just like that perfect someone's gonna it with my fingers just put some of this marinade underneath the skin and then rub a little bit on the top okay and then just tick whatever's left over and just pour it right on top I scrub the whole thing in okay now want to make sure that have lots of flavor on the underside too so I'm gonna take the lemon that I've already got cut and just slice it and just put two slices of lemon inside a couple of sprigs of rosemary now I'm gonna do this at the beach on a grill but you can certainly do it at home in the oven I'd say probably 350 about 35 to 40 minutes will do it so easy okay second one flip it over these are two and a half to three pound chickens and I think that'd just be perfect two sprigs of rosemary salt and pepper flip it over okay that's when the marinade really messy job okay into the fridge for a few hours overnight even better it's going to be absolutely delicious on the grill [Music] broccolini with balsamic vinegar it's such an easy vegetable and the good news so transportable so I can take it to the beach so broccolini is actually like a Chinese vegetable and it's a little more delicate and I just think it has better flavor than regular broccoli it's gonna make a great side dish so that's about three or four bunches of broccolini okay and I put it in a boiling salted water to blanch it about two tablespoons of salt in the water and just in it goes okay that's gonna cook about two to three minutes in the meantime I'm gonna make vinaigrette so quarter cup of olive oil my friend Frank newbold claims not to be a good cook but I know better than that he actually gave me this recipe one and a half tablespoons of balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon of garlic fat one clove seems like a lot of garlic and vinaigrette but you really wanted to be strongly flavored half a teaspoon of Dijon mustard okay why don't have teaspoons of salt half a teaspoon of pepper just whisk it all together and that's the vinaigrette you can actually make the vinaigrette in advance and the broccolini and then put them together just before serving I think broccoli we should be done perfect I'm just gonna put it in ice water to stop the cooking this is a really fast vegetable dish okay let that cool I'm gonna drain it so the broccoli is crisp tender from the blanching and when I put it in ice water shocks it sets is it really bright green okay make sure all the water's out into a bowl pour on the vinaigrette it's a little bit warrent really absorbs the vinaigrette and the juice of half a lemon just adds a real fresh sort of zesty flavor to it toss it up and that's broccolini with balsamic vinaigrette and how easy is that this is gonna be great served at room temperature at the beach and next making one of my favorite desserts of all times have lova it's Geoffrey's birthday and something tells me a birthday cake just isn't gonna make it with candles on it so I decided I'm gonna make a pavlova which is a disc of meringue piled high with whipped cream and I do it with fresh berries it's really just delicious just feels very special what I need is for egg whites at room temperature really important that they're room temperature otherwise you won't get the volume okay into the mixer put a pinch of salt on high speed for about a minute and I'm going to put in a cup of sugar put the sugar in slowly is going to get very sick and shiny [Music] looks like it's nice and thick and shiny now so see what happens it'll just stand up on its own just the way you want just like that I had 50 spoons of corn starch and was sift it right in just makes it nice and thick wait you see this is an amazing dessert and it was named after Anna Pavlova who was a famous ballerina and I think it probably because the meringue looks like her tutu I'm going to add teaspoon of white wine vinegar that actually stabilizes the egg whites and half a teaspoon of good vanilla extract just flavor it's gonna fold that in with a rubber spatula just cut it right down the middle and then pull it up on the side just folded in careful you don't want to deflate the egg whites that's exactly the kind of party I like I love parties at the beach cuz they're sort of very casual and I love when everybody helps out I think everybody has a better time when they're involved in it okay now I'm gonna put it on a sheet pin so what if God is a piece of parchment paper and something that's 9 inches it can be played or a cake band and I'm just gonna draw a line right around the cake pan I want this disc to be exactly 9 inches and the key here is turn the parchment over otherwise you'll end up with the pencil on them right not a good idea just gonna dump all of this right in the middle [Music] to me this is a real sort of New Year's Eve or birthday kind of dessert I'm just really special and nobody knows how easy this just spread this out just to 9 inches it doesn't have to be perfect it's gonna be covered with whipped cream okay this looks pretty good into the oven 180 degrees for an hour and a half and then going to turn the oven off and let it sit for another hour and it's gonna be crisp on the outside and just gooey on the inside it'll be so good piled a tie with cream and berries YUM [Music] how's it going friends perfect great one of the things I like best about pavlova is the combination of textures so there's a crisp meringue and then there's the whipped cream creamy whipped cream fresh berries which has a different texture that I'm gonna make a raspberry sauce that's gonna make the whole thing so gooey and delicious so the first thing I need have kind of fresh raspberries right into the pan half a cup of sugar a quarter of a cup of water so we bring this to a simmer let it simmer for about four minutes until it gets a little syrupy I'm gonna add some friend Oise raspberry jam it's gonna be delicious sauce my gorgeous pet lover I would like to turn up the volume why make regular raspberry sauce when you can make triple raspberry sauce I'm gonna add Framboise I'm gonna add seedless raspberry jam so this is the fastest raspberry sauce on earth take the cooked raspberries one jar of seedless raspberry jam which is about a cup of jam and because I like extra raspberry flavor got a tablespoon of friend wasps it's the raspberry liqueur it's raspberry flavor and color just puree it together that's a raspberry sauce [Music] I'm gonna chill it to be nice and thick I'm gonna mix it with a fresh fruit and use it as a sauce this looks gorgeous really raspberry okay into the fridge [Music] this is the good part I'm going to finish the pavlova so I have one pint of strawberries and I'm going to mix it with half pint of blueberries and half pint of raspberries and port raspberry sauce are all room so I finish everything up because my friend Susan is going to come pick everything up Jeffers thanks for taking a quiet stroll on the beach but instead this little party going on okay that's the strawberries so next thing I need to do is whip some cream so a cup of heavy cream tablespoon sugar he's gonna good vanilla [Music] okay well that whips up I'm gonna get the meringue [Music] I'm just gonna put them around right on [Music] and the work creams just ready I just wanted firm but not too hard just like that yeah okay big slather of whipped cream on top of this and running high bacon that you don't want to assemble this too far in advance they don't just make it to the beach okay that for the gorgeous part strawberries have a kind of blueberries epic cut of raspberries I'm just gonna put that half the sauce or enough sauce over it to mix all the berries it just makes it not dry berries but a whole thing mmm Oh who wouldn't want to have this for dessert and right on top I mean is that gorgeous or what and just let the sauce drizzle down the sides and maybe a little extra sauce to drizzle down Wow I mean if Jeffrey's not happy with that it looks pretty good okay almost ready to go you're packing everything up [Music] hi thank you so much for doing this here I excited okay let me show you what I have I have pavlova in the top okay don't eat it yes ma'am and in

purse every thank you so much okay Jeffery's gonna be home in 10 minutes I've got to do these really fast so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna obscure these tomatoes and throw them right on the grill with a butterflied chicken they can be really good together so I think maybe four on a skewer two skewers per person that works for me they should cook and know five minutes on the grill just until they sort of start to pop and they're really soft this might be the last time Jeffrey's ever home for his birthday sometimes actually thread these with other vegetables like red onion would be good in between the tomatoes but there's so many flavors going on in the butterfly chicken I thought just plain tomatoes olive oil salt and pepper good and simple okay clojure's a little olive oil little bit of pepper and I think I'll use like to see salt for this [Music] roll them around [Music] and I'm never gonna be able to sneak a sheet pan for the beach so I thought I'd just put them in plastic bags

flavor than regular broccoli it's gonna make a great side dish so that's about three or four bunches of broccolini okay I'm gonna put it in a boiling salted water to blanch it about two tablespoons of salt in the water and just in it goes okay that's gonna cook about two to three minutes and the meantime I'm gonna make vinaigrette so quarter cup of olive oil my friend Frank Newbould claims not to be a good cook but I know better than that he actually gave me this recipe one and a half tablespoons of balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon of garlic got one clove seems like a lot of garlic and vinaigrette but you really wanted to be strongly flavored half a teaspoon of Dijon mustard okay why don't have teaspoons of salt half a teaspoon of pepper just whisk it all together and that's the vinaigrette you can actually make the vinaigrette in advance and the broccolini and then put them together just before serving I think the broccolini should be done perfect I'm just gonna put it in ice water to stop the cooking this is a really fast vegetable dish okay let that cool I'm gonna drain it so the broccoli is crisp tender from the blanching and when I put it in ice water it shocks it so it stays really bright green okay make sure all the waters out into a ball pour on the vinaigrette it's a little bit warrant really absorbs the vinaigrette and the juice of half a lemon just adds a real fresh sort of zesty flavor to it toss it up and that's broccolini with balsamic vinaigrette and how easy is that this is gonna be great served at room temperature at the beach and next making one of my favorite desserts of all times have lava it's Geoffrey's birthday and something tells me a birthday cake just isn't gonna make it with candles on it so I decided I'm gonna make a pavlova which is a disc of meringue piled high with whipped cream and I do it with fresh berries it's really just delicious just feels very special what I need is for egg whites at room temperature really important that they're room temperature otherwise you won't get the volume okay into the mixer with a pinch of salt on high speed forgot a minute we put in a cup of sugar put the sugar in slowly is going to get very sick and shiny [Music] looks like it's nice and thick and shiny now so see what happens don't just stand up on its own just the way you want just like that I need 50 spoons of cornstarch and was sift it right in just makes it nice and thick wait to see this is an amazing dessert and it was named after Anna Pavlova who was a famous ballerina [Music] my husband Jeffrey is so generous with me he's always buying me the most extravagant gifts for my birthday but when it comes to his birthday he likes things very low-key so I'm combining three of his favorite things for dinner tonight in his honor rose chicken great friends and the beach first I'm marinating a boneless butterfly chicken to cook on the grill plus skewers of savory cherry tomatoes and on the side crisp broccolini with balsamic vinaigrette and for dessert Jeffrey's favorite mixed berry pavlova a cloud of meringue whipped cream and berries my friends Frank and Susan are helping at the beach and if I'm lucky I can keep it all a secret from the birthday boy [Music] so for Geoffrey's surprise party I thought I'd make something different chicken well the surprise is different kind of chicken I'm gonna make a butterfly chicken I'm gonna do it with lots of herbs and then grill it it's gonna be so good so what I have is a butterfly chicken that I asked the butcher to take all the bones out the wings the legs so it's completely flat and now I'm gonna make a rosemary and lemon marinade for it it's gonna be nice cuz it marinates for a while in the refrigerator and then when it goes on the grill it has all those wonderful flavors of rosemary and lemon but also the charcoal so the first thing I need is a quarter of a cup of fresh rosemary leaves I'm just gonna chop them up the key to this recipe is that I'm gonna make it an herb marinade that goes underneath the skin so it's gonna flavor the chicken the skin and they're gonna roll it up around fresh rosemary leaves and lemons and so the skin and the chicken meat is really flavored chickens pretty bland as it cone so I love to do something really special to make it taste great they gonna chop up rosemary leaves pretty finely cuz they're pretty tough they're not not a tender leaf like a basil leaf really small mints ok so it's a quarter of a cup of rosemary leaves chopped so to measure the whole leaves and then chop them perfect seven into the bowl and then garlic's rosemary and garlic classic combination three cloves of garlic garlic gives it a little heat which is good and the best part of butterfly chicken you can just put it on a board when it's cooked and just slice it you don't have to deal with all those bones into the bowl the zest of half a lemon I love these combination of flavors lemon garlic rosemary about a teaspoon of grated lemon zest and the juice of half a lemon that should be about one and a half tablespoons okay one half tablespoons of olive oil two teaspoons of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper okay I'm just gonna back that all together okay so that's the marinade pull the chicken right up here so when I do this marinade is put it underneath the skin that's really where it has the most flavor so just take your fingers and just run it right between the skin and the meat there's a few connective tissues you want to just get rid of just like that perfect someone's gonna with my fingers just put some of this marinade underneath the skin and then rub a little bit on the top okay and then just take whatever is left over I just pour it right on top I scrub the whole thing in okay now want to make sure that have lots of flavor on the underside too so I'm gonna take the lemon that I've already got cut and just slice it and just put two slices of lemon inside a couple of sprigs of rosemary now I'm gonna do this at the beach on a grill but you can certainly do it at home in the oven I'd say probably 350 about 35 to 40 minutes will do it so easy okay second one flip it over is it when I have two three pound chickens and I think that'd just be perfect strawberries so next thing I need to do is whip some cream so a cup of heavy cream tablespoon sugar he's gonna good vanilla [Music] okay well that whips up I'm gonna get the meringue [Music] [Music] and the work creams just ready I just wanted firm but not too hard just like that yeah okay big slather of whipped cream on top of this and running high bacon that you don't want to assemble this too far in advance we will just make it to the beach okay that for the gorgeous part strawberries have a kind of blueberries epic cut of raspberries I'm just gonna put bet half the sauce or enough sauce over it to mix all the berries it just makes it not dry berries but a whole thing mmm Oh who wouldn't want to have this for dessert and right on top I mean is that gorgeous or what and just let the sauce drizzle down the sides and maybe a little extra sauce to drizzle down Wow I mean if Jeffrey's not happy with that it looks pretty good okay almost ready to go packing everything up [Music] oh thank you so much for doing this you're excited okay let me show you what I have I have pavlova in the top okay don't eat it yes ma'am and in the cooler I have marinated chicken and broccolini so George just throw the chicken on the grill are you under that like joelle minutes on each side all right hope you have a fire extinguisher in your purse every thank you so much dannis okay Jeffery's gonna be home in 10 minutes I've got to do these really fast so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna skewer these tomatoes and throw them right on the grill with a butterfly chicken they can be really good together so I think maybe four on a skewer two skewers per person that works for me this should cookin no five minutes on the grill just until they sort of start to pop and they're really soft this may be the last time Jeffrey's ever home for his birthday sometimes actually thread these with other vegetables like red onion would be good in between the tomatoes but there's so many flavors going on in the butterfly chicken I thought just plain tomatoes olive oil salt and pepper good and simple okay clojure's a little olive oil little bit of pepper and I think I'll use like the sea salt for this [Music] roll them around [Music] and I'm never gonna be able to sneak a sheet pan for the beach so I thought I'd just put them in plastic bags already for the beach [Music] just in time I think I just heard Jeffrey happy birthday I love you on your birthday so it's such a gorgeous night I'm gonna like go up to the beach and then what sounds back for chicken dinner Oh wonderful I was afraid you might be planning something really big me planning something big I would do that to you okay okay first off Ali okay I'm in big trouble [Music]

[Music] the daughter of some friends of ours is a medical student in New York City and she's just finished exams I figure she's been living on snacks while she was studying so I thought wouldn't it be nice to send a home-cooked meal for her and some of her friends I understand Genevieve is a fabulous cook so the pressure is on for the main course beef bourguignon made with filet of beef it's simple and elegant at the same time cooked in a delicious red wine sauce with lots of vegetables and a zucchini gratin that's packed with onions and tender zucchini and with a crunchy cheesy topping and for dessert plum tart with a walnut crust and lots of juicy plums baked inside just what you need after weeks of exams good friends and good food I'm packing it all up and sending it to New York it's like a long-distance takeout so the first thing I want to make for Genevieve is a really old-fashioned homemade dessert called plum tart first I'm gonna make the crust 2 cups of flour I think when you're studying for exams you need something really satisfying 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts these come chopped already but I'm gonna chop them a little more this is a very easy crust you'll see it doesn't have to be rolled out with a rolling pin I'm just gonna press it into the pan this is delicious the combination of walnuts and plums it just wonderful okay into the flour 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar I use light brown sugar I just think brown sugar has a little more flavor serve more of a molasses flavor and I'm gonna mix that together just to combine it then I'm adding one and a half sticks a very cold chopped butter so instead of pastry this is actually more like a crumble you'll see it's gonna be pressed into the pan last ingredient is one egg yolk and that's it gonna bind it together I'll just separate the egg save the whites for meringue and just put it right into the dough just let the mixer go until it starts to come together it looks like a crumble topping for an apple crumble okay done so I'm gonna show you why this is such an easy crust just dump it right out into the tart tin I'm gonna put one and a half cups of the crumb mixture in and then I'm gonna save some for later on top of the fruit so it's a crumble topping on the top it's great so now just press this whole thing right into this tart pan it's a 9 inch tart pan that has a false bottom so it's very easy to get out when you're ready to serve it so this is a trick you take a metal measuring cup and just press it in lightly I'll just run it right around the edge and if it sticks a little bit of flour will help it's also a great thing to do when you're making it like a cookie crust or a graham cracker crust okay then take the cup measure and just smooth out the bottom you can do it with your hands or if you want to make sure it's flat don't press too hard because you want to be sure you can get the tart out of the pan just lightly okay and now for the plums so sometimes when they're in season in August and September I use those Italian prune plums but these are just regular plums and they're perfectly delicious so I'm going to cut these in thirds just make a really beautiful sort of lotus flower pattern in August and September when they're in season I use those wonderful Italian prune plums they're like dark blue and I cut them in quarters because they're smaller but you can really use any plums that are in season these are delicious and since they're bigger I'm cutting them in sixths just make a nice lotus flower pattern and the Thar will be beautiful when it's baked you just these last ones right in the middle it's very earthy it's very simple I think Genevieve and our friends are going to love it okay now the last part is just for the rest of the crumbs right on top just reserved them that great that I love it the crust and the topping are the same thing just put them right around the top plums walnuts brown sugar and bad can that be okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 40 to 50 minutes and it's going to just bake together and be absolutely delicious tonight got some great friends coming over for dinner oh it's wonderful leave all the food to me great well I need some ina advice because now I've got ina dinner flowers no my rule is one color one type of flower and lot and what about the wine burgundy one in the dish I'm making for dinner you probably want to drink the same thing or at least something very similar okay I've got it so I'm really excited about tonight and you're so kind to do this and now I'm gonna go shopping and I'd better get started on making the beef bourguignon the zucchini bread town or you're not gonna have a dinner party tonight if identity by gret ants are a great way to make vegetables particularly because they can be made in advance and then reheated later so I'm gonna make a zucchini gratin to go with the filet before in the olan that I'm gonna make later the first thing I did was saute some onions about a pound of onions and some butter cook them a really low temperature so they're gonna cook really slowly and caramelize delicious and just leave that for a minute now I'm gonna cut up two pounds of zucchini traditionally the French make potato grams but you can make it everything from butternut squash to tomato gratins so I'm just gonna cook this with a lid on for about 10 minutes so the zucchini gets a little bit cooked one teaspoon of pepper I news freshly ground pepper if you can [Music] it's really a classic rundown device for about five minutes I need about 3/4 of a cup of breadcrumbs 3/4 cup of grated Gruyere I'm not gonna become the topping I'm going to add two tablespoons of flour let's make a little bit of a thick sauce [Music] [Music] topping the Gruyere and breadcrumbs it's the cheese and the crumbs that's gonna make this nice and brown and crusty on top it's a great contrast to the creamy zucchini okay now to add a little extra richness a little bit of butter dotted on the top makes it nice and brown just a little and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes then I'm gonna take it out and cool and Genovese to reheat it just before dinner [Music] I'm hosting a dinner party tonight and my friend ina told me that I should get one type of flower in one color I like the sunflowers but I'm afraid they might be a little too tall for conversation I think what might be easier for you or these hyacinth and they're flown in from Holland okay and one bunch costs $15 and probably two bunches will be enough for your boss and you won't have to cut it or anything you can just put it straight in your ball great that's my sort of arranging can we just get them wrapped up sure thank thank you so much enjoy your dinner party I will thank you bye blade beef bourguignon it's a very fancy version of the classic beef bourguignon but for a special party it's really wonderful so I'm going to start with filet of beef three pounds beautiful I'm gonna slice it each slice maybe about one inch thick I should make about eight pieces I actually developed this recipe very early on when I was doing catering and I found it was a nice way to make a traditional flavor but make it really special this is all the traditional flavors of beef bourguignon burgundy bacon carrots fresh thyme now what I'm going to do is I'm going to sear them in a pan a little bit of olive oil and then put them aside make the sauce in the pan that I've seared them get all the flavor of the beef and the best thing about this is I can prepare it in advance and then Genevieve can just heat it up before serving it for dinner I'm gonna get that nice and hot season the beef okay salt season it really well you want the beef to have lots of flavor pepper and then turn it and season on the other side so about two minutes on each side okay now I'm just gonna turn it and sear it on the other side really keeps in the juices and the flavor and it also makes us saw the flavor of the sauce gonna be wonderful okay done someone put this aside on a plate let me see the rest of the needs and then they're making wonderful sauce for them [Music] I'm making fillet of before him y'all it's a classic beef bourguignon but was made with filet of beef so in the same pot that I cooked the beef I've cooked about a quarter of a pound of bacon until it's nice and crisp get all the flavor in there I'm just gonna put it aside and then add it later just leave all the fat that's in the pan so I can cook the vegetables in it two cloves of garlic mince you never want to over cook garlic is burnt really quickly now I'm gonna deglaze the pan with one and a half cups of tea glazing is a process of scraping off all those bits at the bottom of the pan and you can do it with anything that's a little bit acid any kind of vinegar or wine I'm not suggesting you use a really expensive wine but only use something at cooking that you would want to drink okay now I'm gonna add beef stock two cups just just a little more than one of these cans don't have to make these stock yourself unless you really love to do that perfect that's two cups and a tablespoon of tomato paste to give it richness great flavor sometimes I buy this in tubes and it's a great way to keep it in the refrigerator because every recipe seems to recommend one tablespoon and what do you do with the rest okay now let's bring a fresh thyme and just throw the whole thing in or you can strip it whichever you prefer teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper I'm gonna cook this for about ten minutes on a high heat so it reduces and gets really delicious and thick I mean well I'm gonna get carrots ready I like to do them at diagonal but it doesn't really matter I just think it looks nice so it's eight carrots probably about two cups frozen small whole onions they're already peeled they're just great in this so right into the sauce and all the carrots these are all gonna cook together for about 30 minutes until the vegetables are just tender you can really smell the wine what kind of wine Genovese gonna get em having a dinner party tonight and I was supposed to pick up a couple bottles of wine to go with our meal Oh what we'd be serving we're having a beef bourguignon a zucchini Greta and a plum tart the white I'm gonna recommend it's actually the shooting star aligote a The Forgotten grape of Burgundy it's similar to a Chardonnay in body and in style but less oaky less buttery a little bit more stealing sounds great and for red the 2002 Perrin Pinot Noir from California he get a fabulous example of the Pinot Noir grape without the crazy price tag attached [Music] thank you very much thank you so much I'm a wonderful evening I will so the next step for the beef bourguignon is to thicken the sauce so I need three tablespoons of butter about three tablespoons is what's called a beurre manié a which is a thickener butter and flour together two tablespoons of flour I'm just gonna add to the stock of the sauce I know this looks like a lot of steps but each one's really simple and the before you know so delicious it's really worth it it's actually a great way to thicken gravies because it doesn't get bumpy so just add into the stock and while that cooks away I'm just gonna saute some mushrooms so a little bit of olive oil a little bit of butter into a slice up half a pound of mushrooms you never want to wash mushrooms they absorb water too much what you want to do to clean them is just take a kitchen towel and rub it over the top take off any dirt so into the warm butter and olive oil mushrooms for a few minutes until they're nice and brown finished the beef bourguignon and pack of Genevieve's dinner so it's a long trip to the city so for the beef bourguignon the next step is to put everything back together again so I'm gonna put the beef right back in the pan so now we're going to serve it right now I was just heated through for about ten minutes but I'm gonna send it to Genevieve and she's gonna heat it through it's one of the joys of this dish gonna add the mushrooms on top and the bacon that I cooked in the beginning he's gonna shit all together the carrots and onions the sauce looks delicious that wall Genevieve s to do was heated up and she's got a party [Music] there's really no secret to transporting food it just needs to stay below 40 degrees and the food's really cold just get out of the refrigerator let's go step around ice packs [Music] the last one was an ice-cold Sookie nigra tan to be heated up there my friends here to take everything to Manhattan so I've got everything all together for this really kind if you know I'm not doing in any way to get you into a new time we pour some wine for me sure all right this is our first dish we've got zucchini bread time smells so good [Music] and the big one what is that this is a beef bourguignon so this beef bourguignon has burgundy wine and it has carrots and mushrooms we have a pinot noir that we're drinking with it it's all been sent here for us so I didn't have to do too much work we'll send her a photo of us eating later she wants to see us enjoying this party [Music] oh this is much better don't say my dinner party so good see how it goes with this wine and our last masterpiece is a plum tart forgive this serving dish I don't have anything so you'll just have to deal with it it's nothing tastes great and I have a wine for it the alley goat a it is plum and walnut and pull em up plum especially when they're more like this so I think we need to send ina a photo of us now that we're done enjoying have a little toast to her okay toaster ina okay let's see it's loading [Music] that's Genevieve don't you sent me a picture of her good friends I'd say they're having a really good time well I've got everything I need to do today [Music]
[Music] when my friends come to visit I want them to feel like they've checked into the most fabulous country house hotel I want them to sleep really well and I want them to eat really well which is why I'm going to make my fennel roast salmon can be so delicious when I have friends for the weekend I hate being stuck in the kitchen the whole time so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make several recipes where the leftovers become other recipes so this wonderful salmon with fennel that I'm going to make the leftovers are going to become salmon salad for lunch tomorrow and nobody will ever know how easy it was what I'm going to do is fill this whole salmon with sliced fennel and onions and orange and thyme very Provence all spices and then pull this em and over and it will be filled and tied and it's going to be absolutely delicious so now for the filling I want lots of filling actually for two reasons one is because it has great flavor but also I want the salmon to be big and round the way it was when it was swimming around in the sea so about a 1/2 a cup of olive oil and then I'm going to put in the 2 key ingredients here our onions about 5 cups of sliced onions and then about 5 cups of sliced fennel so this is a mandolin it's a great piece of equipment it's also incredibly dangerous so there's a slicer blade right here which you can let raise or lower depending on how thick you want this channel to be slice so the key is to keep your hands out of the way and slice it looks like that right on this and as you get lower you want to keep your hand really out of the way and if you don't have a mandolin a regular knife is perfectly fine just takes ever so slightly longer that should do it see how fast that was once what all this sounds in this pan salt and pepper I always want to salt things as you go along because then the flavoring really is enhanced rather than sitting on the top of the fennel and onions it's going to cook for about 10 minutes in the oil on a medium heat until the onions in the phenols are really translucent and then I'm going to add all kinds of gorgeous for myself flavorings to it so that's perfect for the onions and fennel I just cooked through and just starting to brand and I'm going to add the wonderful ingredients so the two tablespoons of fennel fronds and three tablespoons of fresh thyme leaves live when the heat hits that you can smell it and the dest of one orange and I'm going to put in the juice of one orange about two tablespoons when the orange juice hits the onions and fennel it just when it's hot it just absorbs or beautifully and then lots of salt and pepper to make sure it has great flavor so I'm going to cook this for about five more minutes insatiable love of orange when it goes in I've got a baking sheet with parchment paper on it and it goes into the oven for five minutes and then I'm going to assemble the salmon with a filling tie the whole thing up and put it right on the hot baking sheet and it's really great so I've got the whole salmon that my fishmonger butterflied for me took all the bones out and all the guts and stuff out and I'm just going to season both have with salt and pepper okay now I'm going to take this filling and just pour it on one side of the salmon right down the middle and then take this entire side and flip it over the filling just like that and then I'm going to tie it with kitchen twine about every two inches just like this so it keeps the filling in and it keeps the shape of the salmon perfectly well just like this you can actually make this whole thing in advance but if you want to keep it in the refrigerator cool the filling first and then put it in the salmon and it'll sit in the fridge for a day and then you can throw it into the oven a half an hour before you want to serve it okay so that's really take my hot pan and back in the 500 degree oven for exactly 30 minutes and it's going to be perfect it'll be browned on the outside and succulent and delicious on the inside and my friends I can love it oh here's your room okay you guys make yourself comfortable and probably naturally Danielle Cheers thank you you look seeing it a little bit oh let's take a look at these chocolates what's this look it's a great good [Music] beautiful that feels really good music - we won't be here for at least a couple of days Oh Sam fabulous and love the way it looks all brown on the outside and juicy on the inside I'm going to cut off the strings and then I'll slice it when it's at the table and my friends think it's just an ordinary dinner gonna be really great I just love when the garnish it's from whatever the flavorings are on the dish so that's done got all kinds of greens I have a vinaigrette right in the bottom that was ready and waiting okay everybody dinner's ready I don't know if you think this is enough for the three of us but I'm in a home with family that learned is for you Susan I don't know what earns the Trinity pulse haven't filled with fennel and onions and thyme and I'm just real net or frozen pie would you do it really hard temperature Oh so while my friends rest had having a little private time by themselves I'm going to make lunch with what was left over from dinner last night they'll never recognize it I've had two pounds of salmon leftover salmon salad is wonderful when the salmon is cold you'll see its flakes better watch this just flake it in big flakes into this bowl then what's so moist and tender just going to be delicious so I think we put in celery and onions if the celery has a lot of strings on it an easy way to get rid of a lot it's just run your knife right down the back of it look right in the middle okay then we rough dice we really didn't this so that should be good pile it on top and then we'll mix the whole thing together and then some red onion to give it a little bit of spice the trick to chopping red onion easily is to leave one end intact and it will keep the whole onion together while you chop it and keep your hand out of the way slice it this way and we'll just do a nice dice that's be enough okay red onion and I think some deal would be good in this just run your knife along the edge and take it off the stems I love dill so maybe about two tablespoons of fresh dill would be great on top I love the way the colors look to the next thing I wanted something a little vinegary and I think capers will do the trick and what I'm going to do is I'm going to drain the capers and then put about two tablespoons of capers in it just have a nice spice that don't overpower the flavor I mean they're good little vinegary kind of flavor in it and this is the key ingredient for the salad I love raspberry vinegar with salmon it has a sweetness that somehow really complements the salmon and what I'm going to do is instead of mixing a vinaigrette I'm just pouring it right over the salad so two tablespoons and raspberry vinegar and two tablespoons of olive oil I love the way to select them they'll never recognize it from the roast salmon last night [Music] so delicious you can face all the pressures and famine comes through very clearly and be wonderful for lunch [Music] curried couscous is the quintessential recipe if you can boil water you can make this what I've done is put the couscous and boiling water and a tablespoon of butter in this bowl and I'm just going to it's been sitting here for five minutes and it all you want to do with the fork is just fluff it up a little bit cliff because looks like a grain but it's a pasta semolina and this is North African couscous Israeli couscous has a larger grains that is basically the same thing it's a dried pasta sometimes because because it serves hot I put the lamb dish and vegetables and Moroccan style and sometimes it's served home temperature like this for there are two parts first we want to make the trough and then we're going to check in all kinds of great vegetables the sauce is made with yogurt and curry and I'm just going to whisk them together you can use any kind of yogurt you have around non-fat yogurt low-fat yogurt about a quarter of a cup and a bed a quarter of a cup of olive oil and then white wine vinegar I use white wine vinegar but if you have champagne vinegar whatever you have around it's great just going to make a little creamy sauce which is great curry powder using this how did you like or as mild as you like and turmeric turmeric is one of the ingredients in curry powder but I think it adds a really nice yellow color to this sauce add it in and then salt and pepper remember it's like pasta it needs some good flavouring in it and I'm just going to pour it over the couscous and mix it in I always do this with a fork you don't want the couscous to get tamp down so that's the couscous and then we're going to get all kinds of delicious vegetables in it the first thing is I've got some diced carrots which I think was the great color for that and diced red onion gives it a little bit of heat and some chopped scallions and then parsley get all the herbs in and the two last ingredients are sliced almonds and raisins and this too you can use whatever you like if you like cashews you can put them in I think the almonds look really great and they give a nice crunch to the salad and instead of raisins you can use currants which is sort of smaller and have a little more tartness or you can use dried cranberries you're good so I'm just going to 12 all together big spoons looks gorgeous we'll leave this ass better at room temperature and make my orange try some my friends are here for the weekend and I've already made salmon salad and couscous and now I'm going to make a trifle for dessert what I'm making here is the orange cream that's going to go on the layers of cake and cream and raspberry jam and fresh raspberries so good so what I've done is I've scalded some milk which means to bring it up to just below a simmer with some orange zest it's 1/2 1/2 cups of milk and the zest of one orange and now I'm going to thicken it so over here I have in the mix or five egg yolks that were room-temperature and half a cup of sugar and I'd leave them until they're really light and now I'm going to add two tablespoons of cornstarch since fuck my he had custard actually okay so while that's going on mostly I'm going for the hot milk into the egg yolk mmm so delicious I can smell the orange already so on very low speed so doesn't splatter just going to pour a hot milk into these egg yolk that's great the hot milk and the orange chef and now I'm going to take the whole thing and pour it back into the pan and I'm going to cook it until it thickens so it's like making a custard great back on the fire this is the process where you want to watch it really carefully because if it cooks too much you're not going to end up with orange custard you'll end up with orange scrambled eggs it's not delicious so I'm just going to keep stirring this with a wooden spoon and if it starts to thicken as it's going right now I just get a whisk and just turn off the heat and just whisk it so that's it thickened great and now I'm going to add the flavoring half a teaspoon of vanilla good vanilla it's really important 1/2 a teaspoon of orange liqueur and that might get a little more but that'll be fine a tablespoon of butter and it tapes from the heavy cream this is really wonderful now the last thing is just to be sure there's nothing that looks like scrambled eggs in this I'm going to strain it I'm just going to put a little piece of plastic wrap not over the bowl but actually over the orange cream itself just right on the top and that will make sure that it stays really creamy okay into the fridge to chill and I'm going to lay the table this is my favorite model recent revolt when I travel I love to buy local dishes and flatware things to the table I was like when the napkins match the flowers it gives me a guideline so it's simple it's lunch and I'm going to make the trifle so we've got orange cake raspberry jam the orange cream that I allowed to cool and now I'm going to make some whipped cream the whipped cream is really heavy cream sugar I'm going to use about a cup of cold heavy cream and two tablespoons of sugar and I want it whipped so it's firm and I'm going to add a little bit of vanilla they do better half a teaspoon it's a great treat okay that's perfect just right okay now I'm going to just assemble the whole thing so I'm going to slice the cake and then spread each layer with some raspberry jam okay so each of these layers is going to go in the bottom drizzle some of the orange cream on top and then fresh raspberries I'm going to bigd all the whipped cream this is definitely not something want to eat every day but for a special treat when you have guests coming to stay it's wonderful very casual more raspberries more with creams usually the trifles that are made at the holidays have a lot of liquor in them and they're a little too strong for me so I thought wouldn't it be nice to make something a little lighter and it turned out to be good and then finally raspberries on top a big dollop of whipped cream and I don't think anybody's going to be disappointed but I just have this tiny little piece left over that have to make sure it's okay not bad so this is going to go in the fridge and home ready for lunch and I'm going to show you the simplest sugar snap pea salad you've ever seen my friend staying for the weekend and I've already made salmon salad and couscous and now I'm going to make the easiest thing you can possibly imagine so pay attention sugar snap peas which I love and what I did was take the end off and peel the string down and then blanch them which is putting them in boiling water for about a minute and then taking them out and putting them in cold water and they're just sitting there frigerator and this is the sauce consommé oil and black sesame seeds this is Asian sesame oil so it smells like sesame seeds not that clear flavorless sesame oil and black sesame seeds which you can find in the Asian section of the grocery store and you toss them together maybe with a little salt and that's it it's done and it is just delicious [Music] he's already I made salmon salad with it well we're ready fresh salmon with dill and capers and raspberry vinegar couscous and sugar snap peas cool so everything's ready you guys ready for lon oh yeah how's that that's what you love yourself Sherman so much I think we'll all take a math after this right well they were so hard to make it took me all afternoon [Laughter] clearly better than something nice and life for dessert if it's not a vacation when you're here it's not fun right orange cream and if that isn't enough little whipped cream to top it off how's that how we go oh I took all the calories out before it's served with a couple of raspberries don't you feel like it the fruits of it right welcome that's what we convinced so far no mining this is about as grand as it gets oh thank you where's I sign up she really makes weekend [Music]
[Music] it's Saturday and Geoffrey's coming home from a long trip so I'm gonna plan dinner for tonight and tomorrow night so we can spend the rest of the weekend just having fun for tomorrow's dinner I'm making everyone's favorite comfort food mac and cheese with a mescaline salad to us with creamy mustard vinaigrette and to finish a delicious lemon tart but for tonight we're having big steaming bowls of mussels in white wine [Music] when it comes to comfort food I'd say mac and cheese is pretty high in everybody's list so for dinner tomorrow night I thought I'd make a grown-up mac and cheese with bacon and blue cheese how bad can that be so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just cook the bacon and instead of doing it in a pan with it's spattering all over the place I like to do it on a baking rack in the oven okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes until it's nice and crisp and browned [Music] [Music] okay next to cook the pasta and that's gonna cook for about ten or eleven minutes now I'm going to make a white sauce throw the same white sauce you'd make for any bread tan or pot pie once you've mastered it it's really easy okay so I need one and a half cups of milk and I'm going to heat it up and then another pot two tablespoons of butter [Music] turn on the heat two tablespoons of flour so I'm just gonna cook these together for about two minutes you don't want the butter to burn whisk them together so this cook butter and flour is gonna act as a thickener for the sauce now when add the hot milk to it and it's gonna thicken it okay I'm just gonna cook that over low heat until it just gets a little thicker looking good though okay and the meantime gonna get the cheese is ready so I'm using three different kinds of cheeses videos Greer first cuz it's got a nice nutty flavor it's not great it can actually do this in a food processor - it's really fast but it's not a lot of cheese so I'll just do it by hand okay I need about it half a cup so that's fine and the next one is cheddar putting English cheddar nice sharp okay I need about 1/3 of a cup of cheddar that's perfect and the last Jesus Roquefort and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna crumble about two ounces into the sauce it's gonna give it a really nice piquant tangy flavor okay let's see how this is doing oh the white sauce is just perfect now it's thickened it's not incredibly thick but what it does is just coat the spoon so now off the heat I'm going to add all the cheese's so 1/2 a cup of Greer third of a cup of cheddar and about two ounces of Roquefort you can really use any kind of bleu cheese but Brooke for it has a particularly wonderful flavor a little bit of nutmeg it's a really classic spice that's used in gret ounce you sort of won't know what's there but it'll make everything else taste better give it a stir so the cheese is all melted [Music] that's a much better way to do bacon so it's not splattering all over the place just chop it up just put it right in okay have to drain the pasta [Music] so I'm just gonna put this break back into the sauce to stir it around [Music] this is so easy to make in a large quantity but it's just Geoffrey names making it for two and the best thing is I can make it today and bake it off tomorrow night I can spend tomorrow with Geoffrey instead of cooking ok a little bit of a topping so it's sort of crunchy on the top so take just take two pieces of white bread cut off the crust and just chop them up put them in the bowl of a food processor with the steel blade and just a little bit of fresh basil a couple leaves let's put it right in the food processor with a bread just pulse it until its crumbs okay and just right on top of the mac and cheese so it's creamy on the bottom and crunchy on the top okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake it tomorrow knife for cozy and comforting dinner for Jeffrey me [Music] for dessert tomorrow night I'm gonna make a lemon curd tart usually you have to make tarts just before you eat them but I'm going to show you how to do it a day in advance so I need 12 tablespoons of butter and then absolutely positively need to be room temperature I have a cup of sugar I'm just gonna cream that together 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla this is really a shortbread recipe very very simple and it's absolutely delicious okay those are blended and now I need 1 and 3/4 cups of flour and I'm gonna sift it just because I think it's a great way to make sure the flour doesn't have any lumps in it perfect pinch of salt instead of rolling it out like traditional pastry I'm gonna press it into the pan so that's the flour and the salt I'm just going to put very slowly into the butter I'm doing this on a low speed so it doesn't get whipped [Music] let it get combined until it starts to pull together that's ready so spread it around the pan and then just with with a little bit of flour on my hands I'm just gonna press it right into the pan and this is why it's so important that the butter is at room temperature I actually make all different kinds of tarts like this I make fruit tarts a little bit of raspberry jam raspberry tart with Jeffrey love lemon tarts okay now here's my other little trick is use the edge of the cup measure to make a nice crisp edge so that's the pastry shell done I'm gonna chill it before I bake it and next I'm gonna make the lemon curd for the filling Jeffrey's gonna love this [Music] time to bake the pastry for my lemon curd tart I'll show you how I do this so it's called blind baking and what you do is you put the cold pastry shell on a sheet pan and then take aluminum foil so I'm just going to butter this so it doesn't stick to the pastry and then just put it right inside the shell and then just take a container of beans I just have some red beans that I had in the pantry and pour them right in and this is gonna keep the pastry from sort of puffing up and losing its shape and a bake it this way 350 degrees for about 20 minutes until it just starts to bake and then I'm gonna move the beans and finish baking it until it's nice and browned actually love dahlias whichever comes home tonight I'm gonna make a steaming pot of mussels but somehow fresh flowers from the garden always make it look special that's perfect for a Boz on the counter okay their flowers are done I'm going to finish tomorrow's dinner and then I'm gonna make mussels in white wine for dinner tonight first baking of the tart shell should be done I'm gonna take out the beans so now if I'm lucky this will come out easily that's why you greased it so it comes out I'm just gonna put them back in the container so I can store them in the pantry for the next time I make it tart okay then now the next thing I need to do is just take a fork and prick holes all the way through this tart shell and that'll prevent it from puffing up in the middle all the way around okay into the oven for another 20 minutes until it's nice and browned and delicious [Music] Jeffrey's on his way home I want to finish the lemon tart so I can get started on tonight's dinner so I'm gonna make lemon curd to fill the tart show with I like really tart lemon curd so lots of lemon zest okay so that's the peel of four lemons I'm gonna put it in the food processor one and a half cups of sugar and then I'm just gonna process it with the steel blade just until the lemon zest is really finely chopped they've got lemon infused sugar okay that's it so now the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cream some butter let's take a butter and then add the sugar and lemon zest I'm gonna get all of it so now I'm gonna do four eggs one at a time [Music] okay I'm just gonna scrape down the bowl make sure it's really well mixed so I need a pinch of salt half a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice there's no substitute for freshly squeezed lemon juice don't even think about using the stuff in the bottle perfect half cup of lemon juice mix it up okay that's perfect now what I want to do isn't gonna cook it until it's thickened pour it into the into a pan the key to this is to cook it slowly so it doesn't boil cuz otherwise it'll curdle truly like a custard lemon curd it's great to have around the house actually because it's good for breakfast on toast instead of jam and it lasts in the refrigerator for weeks at the end of this cooking you really want to watch it very carefully because it can curdle pretty fast I think the pastry shell is done perfect nice and brown a little let it cool here I'm going to leave it out on the countertop overnight and then I'm going to chill the lemon curd and tomorrow I'm going to put these both together so this is just perfect now cut gorgeous does it [Music] and it should be just the right amount for the tart shell but I won't be disappointed if there's any leftover into the fridge I'll have a lemon tart for Jeffrey tomorrow and no chicken tonight I'm making Jeffrey's favorite mussels marinara [Music] mussels in white wine it's one of Jeffrey and my favorite things to have when we're in France so I thought it'd be really fun to make them for Jeffrey so for two of us I've got three pounds of mussels I'm just gonna fill the ball with water and then put a little bit of flour in the water and what this does is it takes gets the mussels to give up any sand that's in them okay it smells like to see so while these are soaking I'm gonna make a wine broth with lots of garlic and shallots heat up two tablespoons of olive oil and two tablespoons of butter I'm gonna chop up lots of shallots just roughly chop them this is a great dish it's just served huge balls of steaming mussels with lots of wine broth or shallots and garlic big chunks of French bread okay one cup of chopped shallots right into the oil and butter and then I need like five or six cloves of garlic just chop them up it's a really garlicky dish it's wonderful okay I'm just gonna cook these for a few minutes until the shallots are translucent and the garlic's cooked in the meantime I'm gonna get some tomatoes ready I need about 1/2 a cup of canned tomatoes I'm just gonna chop them up in them and the measure they don't have to be perfect just a rough chop [Music] okay now I need a little saffron which I love it's stamens of crocuses which is why it's so expensive just comfort about a half a teaspoon of saffron it could smell saffron already need some fresh parsley chop it up [Music] okay right in it's a fresh time [Music] not the stat was just the leaves that's about a third of a cup of parsley a bad tablespoon of thyme okay that should do it okay now I need a cup of white wine I've picked a really nice dry white wine something I drink for dinner and this is what's gonna steam the mussels mmm now I'm gonna see how the mussels are doing so they've been soaking in the flour and if you feel a little bit of sand so it was good that we did it because my brother all closed really tight so this one doesn't seem to want to close so I'm gonna discard that just gonna take them out of the water drain them into the dog just toss a little bit with the bra we put on the lid eight to ten minutes and dinner's ready [Music] fine hello you are dreamy when these two I know hey when you're away well it's Saturday night yeah it'll be like Friday night there's no chicken involved yeah I made somebody really special for you oh I can't wait [Music] so what do you think we should do tomorrow you know I was thinking let's just really take a little vacation go to say garber okay I walk on the dock yeah we look at the boat back walk down Main Street push what a wonderful that's Saturday night dinner but I have a question what we're gonna be so busy how we're gonna work in dinner at home you know babe I got that covered I love our weekends together right we [Music] [Music] we're hanging out here we're having a great time and I don't understand how you're gonna make it I can't tell you all my secrets you know but I just don't understand how you're gonna do that's my purpose in life is making you a good dinner mm-hmm [Music] Jeffery's not gonna believe how fast I can make dinner I've got mac and cheese with blue cheese and bacon the lemon curd tart mac and cheese gonna bake 400 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes it's gonna be bubbly and crunchy on the top it's gonna be really good and now I just have to finish the lemon curd tart so to put the lemon curd in the tart since it's been in the refrigerator for a while I'm just gonna heat it up a little bit and then pour it into the cold shell just a little just enough so it's really runny and then it'll cool in the shell that looks delicious just for a second you can really see the lemon zest and this just looks wonderful just needs to warm it up just enough so that it can pour it into the shell and then while the mac and cheese bakes and we have dinner this'll just set now how simple is that okay so while that cools I'm gonna make a nice salad to go with the mac and cheese so I need a little bit of olive oil that half a cup tablespoon of red wine vinegar maybe half a tablespoon of mustard just a little drop of honey just to give it a little sweetness salt and pepper okay I'm just gonna whisk that together and then I'm gonna add some shallots okay just a little bit of shallot give it a little spice some mescaline mix just great cuz already washed and dried and delicious little lettuces and then just enough vinaigrette to moisten it see how that mustard really Mull suffice it toss it all together gonna be wonderful honey dinner's ready how did you whip up this unbelievable dish when we were together all afternoon I have a secret and I'm gonna tell me your secrets after all these years of marriage you can hold the secret from me well that

wine broth or shallots and garlic big chunks of French bread okay 1 cup of chopped shallots right into the oil and butter I'm gonna need like 5 or 6 cloves of garlic just chop them up it's a really garlicky dish it's wonderful okay you're just gonna cook these for a few minutes until the shallots are translucent and the garlic's cooked the meantime I'm gonna get some tomatoes ready I need about

it today and bake it off tomorrow night I can spend tomorrow with Jeffrey instead of cooking okay a little bit of a topping so it's sort of crunchy on the top so take just take two pieces of white bread cut off the cross and just chop them up put them in the bowl of a food processor with the steel blade and just a little bit of fresh basil a couple of leaves let's put it right in the food processor with bread just pulse it until it's crumbs okay and just right on top of the mac and cheese so it's creamy on the bottom and crunchy on the top okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake it tomorrow knife or coat so now I'm going to do four eggs one at a time [Music] okay just go scrape down the bowl make sure it's really well mixed so I need a pinch of salt 1/2 a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice there's no substitute for freshly squeezed lemon juice don't even think about using the stuff in the bottle perfect 1/2 cup of lemon juice mix it up okay that's perfect now what I want to do is I'm gonna cook it until it's thickened pour it into the into a pan the key to this is to cook it slowly so it doesn't boil cuz otherwise it'll curdle truly like a custard lemon curd is great to have around the house actually because it's good for breakfast on toast instead of jam and it lasts in the refrigerator for weeks at the end of this cooking you really want to watch it very carefully because it can curdle pretty fast I think the pastry shell is done it's perfect nice and brown a little bit cool here is going to leave it out on the countertop overnight and then I want to chill the lemon curd and tomorrow I'm going to put the book together now this is just perfect now cut gorgeous [Music] it should be just the right amount for the tart shell but I won't be disappointed if there's any leftover into the fridge it'll have a lemon tart for Jeffrey tomorrow and no chicken tonight I'm making Jeffrey's favorite mussels marinara [Music] mussels in white wine it's one of Jeffrey and my favorite things to have when we're in France so I thought it'd be really fun to make them for Jeffrey so for two of us I've got three pounds of mussels I'm just gonna fill the ball with water and then put a little bit of flour in the water and what this does is it takes gets the mussels to give up any sand that's in them okay okay it smells like to see so while these are soaking I'm gonna make a wine broth with lots of garlic and shallots heat up two tablespoons of olive oil and two tablespoons of butter I'm gonna chop up lots of shallots just roughly chop them this is a great dish it's just serve huge balls of steaming mussels with lots of wine broth or shallots and garlic big chunks of French bread okay one cup of chopped shallots right into the oil and butter I'm gonna need like five or six cloves of garlic just chop them up it's a really garlicky dish it's wonderful okay I'm just gonna cook these for a few minutes until the shallots are translucent and the garlic's cooked the meantime let me get some tomatoes ready I need about 1/2 a cup of canned tomatoes I'm just gonna chop them up in them and the measure they don't have to be perfect just a rough chop [Music] okay now I need a little saffron I love it's the stamens of crocuses which is why it's so expensive its complete about a half a teaspoon of saffron it could smell saffron already need some fresh parsley chop it up [Music] okay right in it's a fresh time [Music] not the stairs just the leaves that's been a third of a cup of parsley I'm bad tablespoon of thyme okay that should do it okay now I need a cup of white wine I picked a really nice dry white wine something I drink for dinner and this is what's gonna steam the mussels mmm now I'm gonna see how the mussels are doing so they've been soaking in the flour and if you feel a little bit of sand so it was good that we did it I'm just make sure they're all close really tight so this one doesn't seem to want to close so I'm gonna discard that I'm just gonna take them out of the water drain them into the club just trust me with it just a bra we put on the whip eight to ten minutes and dinner's ready [Music] fine hello you are my name is - I know I hate when you're away well it's Saturday night yeah it'll be like Friday no there's no chicken involved I've made something really special for you Oh [Music] so what do you think we should do tomorrow no I was thinking let's just really take a little vacation go to say garper okay on the dock yeah well look at the boat back walk down Main Street push what a wonderful that's Saturday night dinner but I have a question what we're gonna be so busy how we're gonna work in dinner at home you know babe I got that covered I love our weekends together right we [Music] [Music] we're hanging out here we're having a great time and I don't understand how you're gonna make I can't tell you all my secrets you know but I just don't understand how you're gonna do that's my purpose in life is making you a good dinner [Laughter] [Music] Jeffery's not gonna believe how fast I can make dinner I've got mac and cheese with blue cheese and bacon the lemon curd tart mac and cheese gonna bake 400 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes it's gonna be bubbly and crunchy on the top it's gonna be really good and now I just have to finish the lemon curd tart so to put the lemon curd in the tart since it's been in the refrigerator for a while I'm just gonna heat it up a little bit and then pour it into the cold shell just a little just enough so it's really runny and then it'll cool in the shell that looks delicious just for a second you can really see the lemon zest and this just looks wonderful just needs to warm it up just enough so that it can pour it into the shell and then while the mac and cheese bakes and we have dinner this'll just set now how simple is that okay so while that cools I'm gonna make a nice salad to go with the mac and cheese so I need a little bit of olive oil about half a cup tablespoon of red wine vinegar maybe half a tablespoon of mustard just a little drop of honey just to give it a little sweetness salt and pepper my cream just gonna whisk that together and I'm gonna add some shallots okay just a little bit of shallot give it a little spice some mescaline mix just great cuz already washed and dried and delicious little lettuces and then just enough vinaigrette to moisten it see how that mustard really mull suffice it toss it all together gonna be wonderful honey dinner's ready how did you whip up this unbelievable dish when we were together all afternoon I have a secret and I'm gonna tell me your secrets after all these years of marriage you're gonna hold the secret from me well that it's really good check then this is mac and cheese like I've never had so what do you think of lemon tart it just looks so good [Music] hmm ah let's say there was a perfect end to the perfect day I would say absolutely right and there's nowhere that I'd rather be than home with you meet you wherever just roughly chop them this is a great dish it's just served huge balls of steaming mussels with lots of wine broth or shallots and garlic big chunks of French bread okay one cup of chopped shallots right into the oil and butter I'm gonna need like five or six cloves of garlic just chop them up it's a really garlicky dish it's wonderful okay I'm just gonna cook these for a few minutes until the shallots are translucent and the garlic's cooked in the meantime I'm gonna get some tomatoes ready I need about 1/2 a cup of canned tomatoes I'm just gonna chop them up in there and the measure they don't have to be perfect just a rough chop [Music] okay now I need a little saffron I love its stamens of crocuses which is why it's so expensive it's going to put about a half a teaspoon of saffron in could smell saffron already need some fresh parsley chop it up [Music] okay right in the fresh thyme [Music] not the stems just the leaves that's about a third of a cup of parsley I just have some red beans that I had in the pantry and pour them right in and this is gonna keep the pastry from sort of puffing up and losing its shape and a bake it this way 350 degrees for about 20 minutes until it just starts to bake and then I'm gonna move the beans and finish baking it until it's nice and browned actually love dahlias whichever comes home tonight I'm gonna make a steaming pot of mussels but somehow fresh flowers from the garden always make it look special that's perfect for a Boz on the counter okay their flowers are done I'm gonna finish tomorrow's dinner and then I'm gonna make mussels in white wine for dinner tonight first baking of the tart shell should be done I'm gonna take out the beans so now if I'm lucky this look I'm at easily that's why you greased it so it comes out I'm just gonna put them back in the container so I can store them in the pantry the next time that make it tart okay then now the next thing I need to do is just take a fork and prick just chop it up put it right in okay time to drain the pasta [Music] so I'm just gonna put this break back into the sauce to stir it around this is so easy to make it a large quantity but since it's just Geoffrey names making it for two and the best thing is I can make it today and bake it off tomorrow night I can spend tomorrow with Geoffrey instead of cooking okay a little bit of a topping so it's sort of crunchy on the top so take just take two pieces of white bread cut off the crust and just chop them up put them in the bowl of a food processor with a steel blade and just a little bit of fresh basil a couple of leaves let's put it right in the food processor with bread just pulse it until its crumbs okay and just right on top of the mac and cheese so it's creamy on the bottom and crunchy on the top okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake it tomorrow night for cozy and comforting dinner for Jeffrey and me okay I'm just gonna cook that over low heat until it just gets a little thicker looking good though okay and the meantime gonna get the cheese is ready so I'm using three different kinds of cheeses news Greer first cuz it's got a nice nutty flavor it's not great it can actually do this in a food processor - it's really fast but it's not a lot of cheese so I'll just do it by hand okay I need about it half a cup so that's fine and the next one is cheddar putting English cheddar nice sharp okay I need about 1/3 of a cup of cheddar that's perfect and the last Jesus Roquefort and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna crumble about two ounces into the sauce it's gonna give it a really nice peak comp tangy flavor
you tomorrow I'm a really busy day and I have friends coming for dinner so I'm gonna make everything in advance and then I can have a party that's absolutely stressful so tomorrow night's dinner is chicken stew with biscuits it's a great meal to make ahead because I can assemble it today and then bake it off just before dinner but I thought while I was cooking off the chicken for the stew I was gonna make myself a little lunch chicken with goat cheese and basil it's really easy so I'm take one of these boneless chicken breasts and run my finger right under the skin between the skin and the meat and then take a little bit of goat cheese I have garlic and herb goat cheese but you can really use any kind of goat cheese or even Brie or mozzarella whatever you have around just take two slices and put it right into the skin just like that and then because I had a little basil in the refrigerator but I put one big basil leaf right underneath the skin and that's gonna flavor it this is really easy enough to do for yourself but it's delicious enough to make for company some other time little olive oil salt and pepper right over the top of the chicken how quick was that so I'm going to roast the chicken at 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and the skin gets really crisp and the chicken will be really juicy and tender so dessert for tomorrow night is summer pudding which is this great make-ahead dessert but first I'm going to wash up and get the berries for the pudding so summer pudding is this really old-fashioned dessert and it's layers of usually bread but I'm going to use brioche because I think it has more flavor and stewed berries and it all sits together overnight in the fridge and the brioche absorbs all that wonderful juice of the berries and just incredibly delicious and it's a great thing to make ahead because all it does it sit in the fridge and then as though that's not good enough I'm going to serve it with rum whipped cream which is just so over the top one pint of strawberries into the pan why don't I have cups of sugar and a little bit of water that a quarter of a cup I'm gonna cook this all together and it's gonna be wonderful stewed berry that's gonna be absorbed by all that gorgeous brioche and then I'm gonna add some other berries and some Framboise you'd be really surprised how much time I spend in the pantry staring at the shelf I've got pastry cream and I'm trying to write a recipe and I think well what would be good in the pastry cream and I take out some tiny yak mmm that's really good with vanilla so or I've got some whipped cream and I'm trying to figure out what to do with it and I look at the rum and I think Oh dark rum that that would be wonderful but right now I'm making summer pudding so I need Framboise so the strawberries have been cooking away with sugar and a little bit of water and it beautifully cooked and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add more berries to it to half pints of fresh raspberries I love to make this in the summer when the berries are particularly good but can really get good berries from California almost all year long to have kinds of fresh blueberries these look like good blueberries and I'm gonna leave one of the half pints of raspberries to put him later just because I want some cooked berries and some fresh berries in it so this gonna cook for about five minutes on a very low flame just like a low simmer okay so while that's happening I'm gonna cut the brioche up but first I gotta clear the decks this is a huge brioche loaf we're going to use most of it made by a friend of mine a lightsaber and makes the most wonderful breads so I'm going to do half-inch thick slices stack them all up cut off the crust it doesn't have to be exact it's more like cake than it is bread so the berries should be done by now and they are it's perfect so but I turn it off and the last thing I'm going to do just to give us some real texture is that another half pint of fresh raspberries off the heat and 2 tablespoons of friend Waze which is raspberry flavored with brandy and it just gives it so much flavor that'll do it so this is a su flavor 7 or 8 inches it doesn't really matter and I want something that's tall enough so after it's set when I turn it out it's high like a cake look great so the first thing is a ladle full of cooked berries in the bottom of the bowl I'm gonna take the brioche and fit it in the bottom remember when you turn it over that's gonna be the top so I want to be sure that there's a really pretty layer okra yosh I'm going to start by doing it around like this let's see how does this fit in so it's you wanted to be sure it fits it nicely so that's just going to sit in there and now another layer of berries and then I could smell the friend blahs when it hits the heat really does a great job of flavoring it and what the oh Sh I find it's easier to assemble it if I cut this in triangles but you still can sort of squish it together and fit it in more berries and juice less lair so now when I turn this out this is the bottom so now I'm just gonna wait it with a plate that's just smaller than the circumference of the souffle dish and then put some kind of a can on top and it's just gonna sit on there for about six or eight hours until it gets sort of denser and absolutely delicious and then I'll take it off and it's gonna be ready whenever I want so while I'm making dinner for my friends tomorrow night I thought I'd make myself a little lunch zucchini with parmesan so I've got some onions cooking here just a little olive oil for five or ten minutes until they're really nicely cooked and a zucchini this is one of my really quick recipes for zucchini to saute it and then hit it with fresh Parmesan cheese at the end it's just delicious then I'm just going to throw this Akemi in and cook this until it's sort of browned on the outside and crisp tender on the inside so I promise I'm Reggiana which is really the best then I'm going to grade it in the food processor but instead of using the grater I'm going to use the steel blade show you how fast it is so all the parmesan just goes right in when you buy from the store you never know when it was grated so I think it's best to grade it yourself so when a salt and pepper this it looks like it's just right so browned on the outside and tender on the inside I'm gonna hit it with a little bit of parmesan until it melts for just a second good lunch I'm just gonna have this Mike chicken stuff with goat cheese and basil so I'm gonna check on the chicken so all the chickens cooked for the chicken stew with biscuits and I had my special lunch chicken with goat cheese and basil you can smell the goat cheese looks so good I'm gonna let this cool in the back I have a wonderful this is so good I should really do this more often I love to plant long rows of tulips because I think the more you put in one ball of each color the better it looks this one's called spring green I think these are gonna be gorgeous they should have quiet very elegant but sometimes I like to be more outrageous so I plant rows of orange tulips or these apricot parrots are just incredible I would never mix them but I think one on the couch will be just gorgeous isn't that incredible love it the good news about parsley is the more you cut it the more it grows and I need lots of it for my chickens still with biscuits chicken stew with biscuits is such a great thing for entertaining because I can assemble the whole thing in advance one of the things I love to do when I'm entertaining is to really master a dish like chicken pot pie or chicken stew and then I can make all different variations of it and I find it so much less stressful so sometimes I'll make chicken stew with biscuits or maybe lobster stew or vegetable stew and I just feel it's really comfortable for me and I know that I can make it really well and now I'm going to make the sauce so I have two cups of onions and one and a half sticks of butter and it's a lot of butter but it's going to make the sauce and they just sauteed for about 10 minutes until the onions are really flavorful and translucent and I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of flour to thicken it so that's half a cup another quarter so I'm just going to add this and cook it for 30 seconds or a minute just until the flour doesn't have any of that raw flour taste in the meantime I've got five cups of chicken stock this is homemade but use a really good can stock if you don't have some and in order to bump up the flavor I put in two bullion cubes chicken bullion cubes and it just adds great flavor to the sauce okay now I'm gonna add that hot chicken stock basically we're doing is making a white sauce I'm just gonna cook this for a minute until the thickens 2 teaspoons of salt make sure it has great flavor and a half a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and then just to make sure it's really good I'm gonna add a quarter of a cup of heavy cream as though it's not rich enough if you want to use half-and-half or milk that's fine too okay now I'm ready to add all the chicken and the vegetables this is six chicken breasts that I roasted off I think I'll do this off the heat actually and about 2 cups of carrots that I blanch for about two minutes right in and now for my secret frozen vegetables some frozen vegetables are really great in this dish they're so easy and they're just as good as fresh vegetables 2 cups of frozen peas one and a half cups of frozen small whole onions so last thing is fresh parsley from my garden and the heat will defrost all the vegetables so comes up perfect now went to the pan I'm going to bake it at 375 for about 15 minutes and meanwhile I'm going to make the biscuits that are going to go on top so now for the biscuits on the chicken stew I have 2 cups of flour tablespoon of baking powder to make them really light teaspoon of salt you'd be surprised how important salt is when you're baking and a teaspoon of sugar I'm just going to mix that together and this is the key ingredient butter so one stick of butter I want it really cold because when you mix it in I want to be sure that it doesn't mix completely into the dough and that's going to go right into the flour and baking powder I'm going to let that mix up until the butter is about the size of peas so while that's going on and get a three-quarters of a cup of half-and-half it just goes right in okay the butters just right last thing we're going to have is about a half a cup of chopped parsley I want this to be a really savory biscuit and that's it we've got the dough for the biscuits the key to this is to make sure they're really light and flaky not like hockey pucks flour on the board I'm going to try and handle this as little as possible so I don't make the butter melt just pull it together it'll be light and flaky and flavorful okay now I'm going to get the stew out of the oven and put the biscuits right on top it's great and just put them right on top in the last biscuit and then what I'm going to do finally is put a little bit of egg wash on the biscuits it's gonna make them really browned and gorgeous egg wash is really an egg and maybe a little bit of water or half and half cream whatever you have around just to thin it okay back in the oven for about twenty to thirty minutes until the chicken stew is really bubbly and hot and the biscuits are nice and browned on the time and then that's all ready for me to reheat it for dinner tomorrow night rum whipped cream for my summer putting it to really good so I have cup of cream I'm going to add three tablespoons of sugar tablespoon of the good stuff good rum it's dark rum I love the way it smells and half a teaspoon of vanilla and just whipping on high smells good already that was noisy into a ball and it's ready for the summer pudding smells like the chicken stew was ready Oh looks so good want to leave it to cool here and then tomorrow night I'm gonna reheat it with a green salad it's gonna be so good now for the moment of truth about my summer pudding it looks pretty good just run a knife on the outside it's the time I always hold my breath but it looks great the berries and the brioche and it worked then that outrageous and so you can smell the berries and the brioche is gonna be just wonderful people are so shocked by it with a big dollop of rum whipped cream on the top it's gonna be so good for dessert for my party tomorrow night I'm even doing the table setting in advance so I've got my gorgeous tool list from the garden I'm thinking green so I've got a white cloth with green dots on it and then I have green plates so you can see once I get a color in my mind I just go with it green everything but different textures and different shades of green think it's really nice okay glasses votive candles and since we're thinking spring green spring green tulips we're done I almost forgot something really important for the party freezing the martini glasses now I'm ready for the party you'd be really surprised how much time I spend in the pantry staring at the shelf I've got pastry cream and I'm trying to write a recipe and I think well what would be good in the pastry cream and I take out some tiny yak mmm that's really good with vanilla so or I've got some whipped cream and I'm trying to figure out what to do with it and I look at the rum and I think Oh dark rum that that would be wonderful but right now I'm making summer pudding so I need Framboise so the strawberries have been cooking away with sugar and a little bit of water and it beautifully cooked and now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to add more berries to it to half pints of fresh raspberries I love to make this in the summer when the berries are particularly good but can really get good berries from California almost all year long to have kinds of fresh blueberry thing to make ahead because all it does is sit in the fridge and then as though that's not good enough I'm going to serve it with rum whipped cream which is just so over the top one kind of strawberries into the pan one and a half cups of sugar a little bit of water.that a quarter of a cup I'm gonna cook this all together and it's gonna be wonderful stewed berry that's gonna be absorbed by all that gorgeous brioche and then I'm gonna add some other berries and some Framboise tomorrow I'm a really busy day and I have friends coming for dinner so I'm gonna make everything in advance and then I can have a part of it's absolutely stressful so tomorrow night's dinner is chicken stew with biscuits it's a great meal to make ahead because I can assemble it today and then bake it off just before dinner but I thought while I was cooking off the chicken for the stew I was going to make myself a little on top of the chicken how quick was that so I'm going to roast the chicken at 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and the skin gets really crisp and the chicken will be really juicy and tender so dessert for tomorrow night is summer pudding which is this great make-ahead dessert but first I'm going to wash up and get the berries for the pudding so summer pudding is this really old-fashioned dessert and it's layers of usually bread but I'm going to use brioche because I think it has more flavor and stewed berries and it all sits together overnight in the fridge and the brioche absorbs all that wonderful juice of the berries and just incredibly delicious and it's a great chicken with goat cheese and basil it's really easy so I take one of these boneless chicken breasts and run my finger right under the skin between the skin and the meat and then take a little bit of goat cheese I have garlic and herb goat cheese but you can really use any kind of goat cheese or even Brie or mozzarella whatever you have around just take two slices and put it right into the skin just like that and then cuz I had a little basil in the refrigerator but I put one big basil leaf right underneath the skin and that's gonna flavor it this is really easy enough to do for yourself but it's delicious enough to make for company some other time little olive oil salt and pepper right over the
coconut cupcakes are one of Stephens favorite desserts I'm gonna make them for his birthday so 3/4 a pound of butter and 2 cups of sugar the next step is the eggs and this recipe calls for 5 eggs so one and a half teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and one and a half teaspoons of pure on the Dex tract and now I'm going to put together my dry mixture and a wet mixture that are gonna go in alternately I'll show you so I need about 3 cups of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking powder 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 a teaspoon of kosher salt and the next thing is buttermilk so I've 1 cup of buttermilk I want to turn the mixer on very low speed and I want to add the quarter of the flour until it's just mixed in remember when start doing the flour you don't want to over mix it a third of the liquid ingredients another portion of flour until it's just mixed in another portion of liquid ingredients this is going to make a really moist delicious coconut cupcake and then the last ingredient is coconut so it's 7 ounces of coconut that goes right in you can actually do it on the mixer I like to do it by hand and it's just perfect and then we're going to add more coconut to the top with the icing this is my secret for making coconut cupcakes every single one is exactly the same size ice cream scoop just a regular a standard ice cream scoop and you fill it up so it's sort of overflowing like that and then you plop one in each and that they're gonna rise a little bit but not so much so that's exactly the size you want them so they're gonna go in the oven 325 for about 25 minutes until they're done and then I'm gonna ice them so that's a pound of cream cheese and 3/4 of a pound of butter 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract the good kind and 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract these are the two flavorings in the coconut cupcakes so really has the same kind of flavoring just combine it like that and now the last ingredient how easy is this is one and a half pounds of confectioner sugar on a very low speed I'm going to very slowly I had the confectioner sugar to the cream cheese butter and flavorings and that's it so you want lots of icing on top because it's the yummy part of this and then the final touch is coconut so I'm gonna start then you're gonna keep going lots of coconut right on the top how we understand from eating them before the party more coconut never too much coconut [Music]
[Music] [Music] Halloween isn't just for kids why should they have all the fun I've invited some friends for trick-or-treat dinner and Miguel is setting the table cut this black and orange thing going what is Halloween first I'm making a black cocktail espresso martinis with a twist of orange zest followed by a delicious loin of pork with fennel rosemary and garlic served with oven-roasted applesauce and string beans with garlic to ward off the vampires and for dessert a devilishly rich chocolate cake with glow-in-the-dark orange buttercream [Music] I so for halloween i thought i'd make a fabulous halloween cake i wanted to do something with black and orange how many desserts are black and orange so i thought i'd make a chocolate cake with orange buttercream very halloween so I'm going to start with half pound of butter cup of sugar and a cup of brown sugar or didn't just give it a little extra flavor fracture or sugar with molasses at it I just want lightly packed right in I'm just going to cream these medium high speed into their light and fluffy about five minutes so while those are creaming we're going to get the dry ingredients together the first thing you need is to only half cups of all-purpose flour this is really handy it's a 2-cup measure [Music] one half cups of really good cocoa powder [Music] the arrows 240 teaspoons of baking soda and a half teaspoon salt the cubic trumpet case to make sure it's really moist and light so I'm just going to sift these together didn't want a Halloween Horror instead of a Halloween tree ok that's the dry ingredients next thing in these three eggs because I'm always wary about eggs everyone still why you get a bad one I do them into it separate ball okay that's one just let it mix in completely this is the importance of creaming the butter really well because then all the other ingredients go in really easily the three eggs three teaspoons of good vanilla vanilla and chocolate a really important flavor combination the next thing you're the wet ingredients buttermilk need wanting to have cups three-quarters of a cup of sour cream the butter milk and sour cream are going to make it a really moist cake and the last thing is coffee three tablespoons of brewed coffee it just really brings out the chocolate flavor whisk these together the best way to keep it bad or really light is to mix the dry ingredients in the wet ingredients ultimately into the batter starting and ending with the dry ingredients and we're just going to turn on low and then just add about a quarter of the dry ingredients to the batter and then a third of the wet ingredients it's important that they mix really well but not over mix and then another quarter it's a great cake the orange buttercream on top is just wild maybe I'll decorate with some Halloween candy ok that's the wet ingredients and now the last of the dry ingredients perfect so I'm going to put this and a half sheet pan let's actually can buy this in specialty cookware stores what i did was i greased it and floured it and then it tapped out the excess so it's just a light dusting of flour on it for the whole batter in here Sol will smooth the top I'm gonna bake this cake 350 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes until a toothpick just comes out clean okay into the oven and then I'm gonna go see what kind of spell Miguel is casting on my dining room oh my god this looks scary how fast is very gothic I like that good oh I love these gorgeous what are you doing so we're gonna have orange flows on the table love orange flowers we're going to have some witches hats on the plates oh these are great and can we wear them those of you we're going to have orange bags with a votive inside you give a nice orange glow water today I'll slimy like a haunted house exactly all along the table I'm gonna go contra black cock tip for Halloween you better go do that I was trying to think of some kind of cocktail that would get everybody in the Halloween sphere would be something black and I came up with an espresso martini with an orange twist I think it'll do the trick espresso martinis doesn't it sound like a great idea so the first thing in use two cups of espresso I need these presso earlier so it's cool i like to make it with decaf I don't want to have jittery guests I'm making a lot of these enough for eight people right into a picture to Kosovo orange vodka you can really make these in individual drinks it's two ounces of espresso two ounces of orange vodka and one ounce of coffee liqueur or person but I'm making a big picture of them and then later what I'm going to do is I'm going to shake them with ice really good and one cup of coffee flavored liqueur kemps that look like Halloween at what I'm just going to stir this up and then later I'm going to serve it over ice and a shaker with a nice twist of orange it's going really good and now i'm going to make loin of pork with oven-roasted apple sauce to go with it [Music] when autumn comes in East Hampton I'm always the first to go to the apple orchard and get all different kinds of wonderful flavor and apples and I always have to make applesauce it's homemade applesauce that I make in the oven it's just delicious I have six pounds of apples three pounds of Macintosh and three pounds of Granny Smith and I actually combine them just has much more flavor the Granny Smith are really tart but McIntosh are sweet you can use whatever you like McCain Winesap the more different kinds of apples you use the more depth of flavor the applesauce will have granny smith you can usually find all year round okay so it peeled and cored them just put them right in the bowl ok that's the apples next I'm going to do orange juice and orange zest so the juice and zest of two oranges this recipe really exemplifies how I feel that cooking it's all about making the apples taste more apple like and in this case sort of apple pie like so that's the zest we'll put it right in and then the juice of two oranges this will actually not only flavor it but it also keep the apples from turning brown well thats citrus ok that's the oranges and a dilemma it's just one moment give it a little tartness the best thing about this recipe is instead of doing on the top of the steps you're always adjusting it and worrying about it Bernie it cooks in the oven so you put it in the oven and just forget about it for an hour so the zest of one lemon and the juice of one lemon will put it through a sieve so I don't get the seeds and the applesauce nobody wanted aight intimacy this is all together okay now into the pot so i'm using a Dutch oven that has a lid all the juice all the apples all the zest cut the cup of brown sugar I use light brown sugar whatever you have around is just fine lightly cat a little bit of butter just to give a little richest four tablespoons right in don't even have to mix it two teaspoons of cinnamon half a teaspoon of allspice and here's the surprise if you take some of these red apple peels and bake them along with the apples it all comes out a sort of a rosy color it's just gorgeous and right into the oven have a crowd coming for Halloween I'm going to make a roast loin of pork with fennel and garlic and rosemary what I've done is I've asked the butcher to give me a French loin of pork so the bones had been scraped and just a little layer of fat on the top to keep it really moist and I'm gonna make a delicious rub to go with it the first thing it needs six cloves of garlic right listen process it a third of a cup of chopped rosemary leaves just a little rough chop for it brings the food processor 2 tablespoons of lemon zest and 2 teaspoons of fennel seeds just going to grind it up from a nap smiles or muster a few other things great I'm going to add two tablespoons of olive oil only this is a rub so it just has to go on outside capital good Dijon mustard tablespoon of salt and about a teaspoon of black pepper now that's pretty easy so now for the loin of pork so this is about a five pound loin of pork it's got 10 bones when I serve it and we'll slice it into individual portions so we just take the rub and just put it right on top I've let them meet sit out for about 30 minutes and that way it's not so cold when it goes in the oven and it cooks more evenly it's going to be so delicious with girl extreme beans and warm apple sauce okay into the oven 400 degrees for about an hour and a quarter until the internal temperature is 140 degrees and next I'm gonna make some really scary orange buttercream to go on my chocolate cake [Music] what's a halloween party without a great halloween dessert so I've made the chocolate sheet cake and I'm going to do bright orange buttercream to put on top if two-thirds of a cup of water and two cups of sugar I'm just going to melt the sugar in the water it'll lay it on and then I'm going to get it up to 240 degrees in the meantime I'm gonna whip some egg whites I need six egg whites they have to be room temperature so you get really good volume this actually classic buttercream to make four wedding cakes and I've made a lot I just need the white so you can save the yolks for something else I think ice cream there's some really quick butter creams that you can just make sugar and butter and flavorings and it's really much easier but I have to say it's nothing like this okay that's six egg whites I'm since the sugar in water and see how it's doing perfect is boiling away and now what I'm going to do is take my candy thermometer just put it in I want to bring it up to 240 degrees and still just fine by itself okay six egg whites into the mixer with a whisk attachment quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar a little bit with going to whip it on high until they form soft peaks come on perfect we're there 240 degrees we pour it into a pitcher because easier to pour into the buttercream this is so five and I'm just very very slowly pour it into the egg whites just a very thin stream of sugar syrup would you really slowly so you don't deflate the egg whites fantastic oh the sugar syrup in now little lady cook for about 10 to 15 minutes miguel adoption is amazing thank you so much no at love it's both halloween spooky but it's also very elegant are you in charge of candles yes and I've got a cake that's going to go perfectly with [Music] Wow leave it to Miguel to do an incredible room not just a table setting but the whole room so I think this is cool enough it has to be room temperature the sugar and the syrup this is what it looks like it's basically meringue just wonderful and it's the base for the buttercream that I'm going to do on my halloween cake so just going to turn it on medium speed now we have butter lots of butter five sticks of butter it's a pound and a quarter just a little bit at a time so it gets really next in and the butter has to be absolutely room temperature not just sort of soft it has to be completely room temperature I leave it out like overnight make sure it's completely soft okay that's all the button 2 teaspoons of bid gonna give it lots of flavor three tablespoons of cars to occur No and now to make it a really scary halloween cake one tablespoon of orange food coloring all orange food coloring differs so it depends on how intense yours is this is pretty intense you might need a little more clear the decks because of cape all fools how's that for orange icing so I'm just going to put it right on the cake actually find a palette nice the best thing for spreading out I say like I just smooth it out a nice simple layer and i'll show you how to make it really nice and smooth hot water okay ok now we're ready for decoration and since it's Halloween of candy corn just like we always remember thinking about something I'm not gonna let you see okay don't look [Music] really there and who's that Halloween is just for kids [Music] okay these are espresso martinis it is indeed my creation and I thought it was as close to a black drink that you could possibly get Miguel cheers everybody [Music] until I get back to finish Tim so the lot of forks been resting for about 20 minutes and that allows all the juices to get back into the meat which is really important keeping it just tender and moist so now I'm just going to slice them in between each bone and then arrange it on the platter just keep it warm with foil it's perfect just slightly pink can do this without the box but I always think it's just so elegant to do it with the bones it smells so good until the rosemary garlic fennel seeds even the lemon zest okay just going to cover with foil to get everything else ready the Apple skins are out they turn this sauce a nice rosy color just going to mix it with a whisk just to break up the apples perfect okay into the serving dish the big ladle it's gonna be so good with a loin of pork rosemary and garlic [Music] okay last thing to do before dinner stream beans with garlic boiling water salt and about a pound and half of string beans for eight people I'm just going to blanch them for about a minute or two I think the best way to cook vegetables is to blanch them first and then saute them with flavor just going to drain them okay now what I'm going to do is sauté them a big saute pan a few tablespoons of butter few tablespoons of olive oil get the best properties of both let's reclose the garlic just toss the beans in to pull the toss there's so much prefer putting the vegetables and the meat on one platter next to meat looks so much better perfect I say that looks good enough to eat and the apple sauce and we're ready for dinner [Music] [Music] okay guys you've had your treat now i'm going to show you the trick watch this [Music] [Music] Halloween isn't just for kids or do they have all the fun I've invited some friends for trick-or-treat dinner and Miguel is setting the table got this black and orange thing going what is Halloween first I'm making a black cocktail espresso martinis with a twist of orange zest followed by a delicious loin of pork with fennel rosemary and garlic served with oven-roasted applesauce and string beans with garlic to ward off the vampires then for dessert a devilishly rich chocolate cake with glow-in-the-dark orange buttercream [Music] so for Halloween I thought I'd make a fabulous halloween cake I wanted to do something with black and orange how many desserts are black and orange so I thought I'd make a chocolate cake with orange buttercream very Halloween so I want to start with half pound of butter cup of sugar and a cup of brown sugar attendant just gives it a little extra flavor right sugar or sugar with molasses added just want lightly packed right in I'm just going to cream these medium high speed into their light and fluffy about five minutes so while those are creaming we're going to get the dry ingredients together the first thing you need is two and a half cups of all-purpose flour this is really handy it's a 2-cup measure [Music] one and a half cups of really good cocoa powder [Music] 240 teaspoons of baking soda and a half teaspoon of salt the key to chocolate cakes to make sure it's really moist and light so I'm just going to sift these together you don't want a halloween horror and save a Halloween tree ok that's the dry ingredients that's their needs three eggs because I'm always wary about eggs everyone's to why you get a bad one I do them into a separate Bowl okay that's one just let it mix in completely this is the importance of creaming the butter really well because then all the other ingredients go in really easily the three eggs three teaspoons of good vanilla vanilla and chocolate a really important flavor combination the next thing where the wet ingredients buttermilk need one and a half cups three-quarters of a cup of sour cream the butter milk and sour cream are going to make it a really moist cake and the last thing is coffee three tablespoons of brewed coffee it just really brings out the chocolate flavor whisk these together the best way to keep it bad or really light is to mix the dry ingredients in the wet ingredients ultimately into the batter starting and ending with the dry ingredients and we're just going to turn on low and then just add about a quarter of the dry ingredients to the batter and then a third of the wet ingredients it's important that they mix really well but not over mix and then another quarter it's a great cake the orange buttercream on top is just wild we've got decorated some Halloween candy ok that's the wet ingredients and now the last of the dry ingredients perfect so I'm going to put this and a half sheet pan let's actually can buy this in specialty cookware stores what i did was i greased it and floured it and then it tapped out the excess so it's just a light dusting of flour on it pour the whole battery again Sol will smooth the top I'm gonna bake this cake 350 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes until a toothpick just comes out clean okay into the oven and then I'm going to go see what kind of spell Miguel is casting on my dining room [Music] oh my god this looks scary how fat is very gothic I like that good oh I love these for just what are you doing so we're going to have orange flowers on the table of orange flowers we're going to have some witches hats on the plates oh these are great and can we wear them cool we're going to have orange bags with a votive inside you get a nice orange glow water today I'll slimy like a haunted house exactly all around the table I'm gonna go contra black cop for halloween you better go do that I was trying to think of some kind of cocktail that would get everybody in the Halloween sphere I'd be something black and I came up with an espresso martini with an orange twist I think it'll do the trick espresso martinis doesn't it sound like a great idea so the first thing I need is two cups of espresso I need these press over earlier so it's cool i like to make it with decaf I don't want to have jittery guests I'm making a lot of these enough for eight people right into a picture to coast

orange vodka you can really make these and individual drinks it's two ounces of espresso two ounces of orange vodka and one ounce of coffee liqueur or person but I'm making a big picture of them and then later what I'm going to do is I'm going to shake them with ice really good and one cup of coffee flavored liqueur kemps that look like Halloween at what I'm just going to stir this up and then later I'm going to serve it over ice and a shaker with a nice twist of orange it's going to be really good and now i'm going to make loin of pork with oven-roasted apple sauce to go with it [Music] when autumn comes in East Hampton I'm always the first to go to the apple orchard and get all different kinds of wonderful flavor and apples and I always have to make applesauce it's homemade

two oranges
so for the turkey meatloaf I've already sauteed two large onions and some olive oil salt and pepper and some fresh thyme that I got out of my garden I love the smell of fresh thyme I love it in the turkey meatloaf just take it off a stem like that so I cooked it all together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and they're just cooked through but not browned and then I'm going to add some other ingredients to make it flavorful I'm actually you can do this off the heat Worcestershire sauce chicken stock and some tomato paste so about a third of a cup of Worcestershire sauce 3/4 of a cup of chicken stock I have homemade chicken stock but you can use a good canned chicken stock and he's good to mate app it's really thick it'll add a lot of flavor that 1 and 1/2 teaspoons I'm just going to mix that all together this is the kind of meatloaf even your husband won't believe it's not beef it's delicious so this is ground turkey it's actually better for you than ground beef and it's not you can get get it at the butcher he's going to say to you you want white 5 pounds of ground turkey it's a lot you can always cut the recipe in half but I think why not make a large quantity and you can always have it for sandwiches I want to take all the wonderful flavoring dump it into the turkey meatloaf put in one and a half cups of plain breadcrumbs I just use package breadcrumbs they taste just as good in this recipe as homemade ones and there's so much easier and then three eggs and that's going to hold the mixture together this is great in the winter served hot but it's also wonderful in the summer served cold with a green salad and of course when there's lots of turkey meat left my husband's very happy because I make a meatloaf sandwiches for lunch so I'm just going to pour this on top and now comes a really squishy part clean ham I'm going to just mix all this together I want to do a really lightly I don't want to pack it down so I'm going to do a really fingertip II just mix it together it Whitely until all the onions and the Worcestershire sauce and the breadcrumbs are mixed in with the turkey okay that's it nicely mixed and now all I'm going to do with really messy hands is dump it out on this pan and shape it into the meatloaf this is a really freeform meatloaf shape so I'm just going to make it into a meatloaf I'm going to put ketchup over the top of it to keep it really moist and delicious how homey is that great okay so this goes in the oven 325 for about an hour and a half
[Music] remember new kid and a family moved into the neighborhood the first thing you would do is run down the street to see if any kids your age and then your mother would bring a cake now they probably needed more help moving furniture than they needed cake but it was a really nice gesture my friend Valerie Smith is move next door and I thought instead of bringing her cake I'm gonna bring her entire party for six friends I'm making french cheese puffs which she can just heat up in her new oven then tender juicy loin of pork with a spicy green peppercorn sauce buttery small whole potatoes tossed with lots of fresh green herbs asparagus roasted with olive oil and coarse salt and for dessert an upside-down apple cake cotta with delicious cake and caramelized apples it'll be great way to welcome Valerie to the food so I thought for my friend Valerie's housewarming party would be really nice assembly very elegant but very simple to serve so what I'm gonna make is a roast loin of pork with green peppercorn sauce it's a beautiful pork loin I've left it out of the refrigerator for about 30 minutes I mean actually cooks better if it's not really cold through the refrigerator right into the roasting pan [Applause] so first thing is two tablespoons of good olive oil I use two kinds of mustard I use coarse grain mustard both for the flavor but also I love that it looks like mustard two teaspoons against my the mustard already and two teaspoons of Dijon mustard which has the spice two teaspoons of salt I use kosher salt half a teaspoon of black pepper and the last ingredient is fennel seeds you can buy them whole like this it's got an anise flavor and I think it's gonna be really good with a pork but what I'm gonna do is grind them first I'll show you how I can do it really fast I use a coffee grinder it's a really easy way to grind spices pepper anything like that it's gonna make a lot of noise I need 1 teaspoon of ground fennel seed you can really smell it when it's freshly ground wonderful okay into the oven so I'm gonna roast it for about an hour and 15 minutes at 400 degrees until the internal temperature is exactly 140 degrees I've got to be really fun to make cheese pasta Valerie's party they look a little complicated but they're really once you get the hang of it they're not that hard to make so let me show you how to make the pastry it's called patashu or choux paste first I have a cup of milk and a quarter of a pound of butter that is everything on the quarter pound of butter in it a teaspoon of salt about an eighth of a teaspoon of pepper just a little pinch of nutmeg we're just gonna heat that up and then I'm gonna have flour too but first I want to show you about Parmesan cheese so this is really good Parmesan cheese it's Reggiano parmesan and it has a rind on it you always want to cut the rind off and there are lots of ways to grade it but I think the best way to grade it is by cutting it up in little pieces keep your fingers away cuz it's really hard it's easy for a knife to slip and just put it in the food processor with a steel blade just like that instead of grading it you're really grinding it but it's really good and fast that's no sweat grated Parmesan and I actually always store it in the container in the refrigerator it lasts for a really long time or if you're not gonna use it quickly you can always put it in the freezer okay so the next thing is a cup of flour and this is the key you want to dump it in all at once and this can make a total mess and you're gonna get really nervous about it because I did when I first did this but once you've done it once or twice you sort of get the hang of what it's supposed to look like and then eventually actually pretty quickly it all pulls together into one paste okay off the heat and into the food processor while it's hot you just want to dump in for extra-large eggs just like that a quarter of a cup of grated Parmesan and we know it's freshly grated Parmesan half a cup of grated Gruyere cheese the two cheese's really have very different flavors so the two of them together good Parmesan is a little punchier greer has a rounder flavor so they bickered together just process it until become smooth and that's it so I'm gonna take baking sheets with parchment paper but this way to fill pastry bag is to roll the top down just like that there's a plain round tip in the bottom its movie about a half an inch I'm just gonna feel this bad Pat touch you see how nice and thick it is that looks gorgeous okay so now I just want to make pull this up so it's neat and I just wanna make little mounds Missal depending on how big you make them this will make about a 35 or 40 little puffs dip your finger a little bit of water and just press down that little tip you don't want it to burn when it bakes okay little egg wash which is egg mixed with a little bit of water or milk just lightly egg wash makes it browner just a little bit of gray air right on the top I'm gonna bake these at 425 for about 15 minutes and they're gonna be puffed and golden and just delicious or Valerie's party [Music] and then I'm gonna start working on the apple cake town [Music] so for dessert I'm gonna make an apple cake to town which is very simple version of a French Apple take town so first I'm gonna make caramel which is cup of sugar 1/3 of a cup of water and I'm just going to cook it you can do thermometer to make sure I don't overcook it until it sort of brown and caramelized about 360 degrees that I can do the monitor excellent okay next we need the apples so just cut the apples cut out the core and cut them in wedges and I think for this probably three wedges so you'll have 1208 wedges per Apple okay just take the apples and put them in a greased pan a glass nine inch pie pan is perfect you can find one in a hardware store and just run the apples around the outside and then when you turn it over all those caramelized apples are going to show it's going to be great [Music] three right there want to get them in tight okay now for the gorgeous syrup and it looks like it's perfect it's really just turned beautiful golden brown smell it smells great I'm just gonna pour it right over the apples [Music] that look great now I'm gonna make a sour cream cake still on top and bake the whole thing together so good so it's a really simple cake 6 tablespoons of butter 3/4 of a cup of sugar just cream that together two eggs it's really important to have room-temperature eggs okay next ingredients are a third of a cup of sour cream okay half a teaspoon of lemon zest half a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and mix it all up it's a mouth for the dry ingredients I need a cup plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour you need a half a teaspoon of baking powder quarter of teaspoon of salt let's go sift these all together and that way if there's a little piece of flour or something in the bottom you can either sieve it or just take it out so make sure that you really have smooth dry ingredients so with the mixer on low whose been slowly add the dry ingredients okay now just take the batter and just spread it out over the apples and the caramel and it's gonna be puffed and golden and just gorgeous when you turn it out upside down with the apples on top okay just spread it out what a knife would be helpful spread that smoothly on top of the caramel the apples and then I'm gonna bake it at 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until the cake is done and a cake tester comes out clean right into the oven [Music] I'm so happy I made you cheese puffs tonight we're making dinner too but the cheese pasta to start so why don't you heat them up like 350 degrees out five minutes perfect and then you guess I'll have wonderful food secret drinks can our be over later with dinner thank you I'll wait to see you tonight okay next thing is herb new potatoes watch how easy this is literally cook themselves so put some butter in a pan just gonna melt that and I use Yukon Gold potatoes they're just scrubbed don't peel them just make sure they're nice and clean put them right in lots of salt and pepper so when the butter melts and I put the lid on the top the steam from the butter and the potatoes are gonna cook the potatoes all by themselves and then later on the professor rubs on it put the lid on for about 30 minutes in the steam will I turn out the Apple cake you mmm this is the apple cake tech town that I made for dinner at Valerie's house it's gonna be really great with a loin of pork so this is the hard part is turning it out it's caramelized apples on the bottom a nice light cake on the top so wish me luck oh look how great that walk so you just have to loosen it a little bit and I think I did it Wow that's really great okay and a little bit of powdered sugar on the top and I think that's perfect for housewarming at Valerie's house certainly is a lucky thing I never a neighbor [Music] nobody does it better than she does I think the loin of pork is gonna be done it's gorgeous now I'm just gonna come to make sure it's the right temperature needs to be 140 degrees internal temperature which is why one of these instant thermometers is really useful just takes a second 140 degrees exactly okay okay put this on the tray to let it rest while I make the sauce this way keeps it warm and all the juices get back into the one of course oh it's moist and delicious and perfectly cooked okay for the sauce I need about a quarter of a cup of fat in the pan need three tablespoons of flour just let that cook for about a minute it's really like making a gravy okay next thing is a cup of white wine put white wine something you drink three cups of chicken stock okay get that nice and hot and I'm going to add some great flavors this is really the marinade that we put on the top of the pork two teaspoons of coarse grain mustard two teaspoons of Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper maybe give it lots of flavor green peppercorns they're in a brine you want to drain off come in a jar okay just about a quarter of a cup let's go really flavor the sauce so I'm just going with this simmer over a low heat for about five or ten minutes until all the flavors really fun to eat delicious [Music] and this is a good thing to do you can't hurt time the house smelling nice it's really nice to have something green so I decided roast asparagus would be great you always want to balance the flavor in color and texture so these are great asparagus I love when asparagus is a little thicker but you want to peel them so they're not so tough I think they have much more flavor than those sort of pencil asparagus you can find okay great very quick olive oil salt and pepper 400 degrees in the oven at 25 minutes and they'll be nice and browned on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside a little salt little pepper how is that I'm gonna wrestle the Balor's and now I think these potatoes are done oh they smell great no chops and pressure but on top so what do I have I have parsley the exact just a bunch of each one and I have some ties to my garden that's great because they're sort of a very mild onion flavor and so just run your knife along the stem so you get more dill thence down okay so now great combination of flavors and it's go with terrific on the potatoes fine absolutely divine and what did she tell me five minutes right okay how many of those I can eat before everybody moves here I don't know have an awful lot to carry but good news is I have a really good looking guy coming to help me what do we got here well we have asparagus and potatoes and maybe I'll carry this and you can get everything else a big heavy pot so we have a cake oh this looks fun we're gonna take this guy listen to you thank you apple cake by the terrace and I'll take with it whoever can I keep you take that okay I got it I'll take this I think we're talking about two trips I'll be back right let's go [Music] all right you're in charge of the cheese but don't have too much fun until I get back okay we need to get everything together for dinner one of the pork that was perfect just slightly pink on the inside it's gonna be so good with a green peppercorn sauce and they have these nice little handles makes it easy to put it on the platter okay I think that should be enough for now I can always come back and get more okay now I've got the potatoes oh it's perfect with the fresh green herbs and parsley and dill and chives just mix it all in it smells so good all this with potatoes and butter we green herbs and gorgeous right on the platter okay last thing asparagus perfect versus very simple really simple salt pepper olive oil so much more flavor than boiled a little bit of sauce green peppercorns and it smells great all right Fowler you're first considering up your party queen for a day Valerie for you in honor of you

spinach bread tan which is really good and smashley potatoes and for dessert and make my favorite class on bread pudding it's going to be a really good meal so I'm going to put some salt in the middle and some freshly ground pepper make sure it's really well seasoned we're not going to do stuffing you know it's enough of the stuffing I'm going to put all kinds of things in the cavity that are going to give it lots of flavor so I'm going to stuff it with onion forget peeling it forget just chop the whole thing up and just put it right into the inside of the turkey great and then maybe big sprigs of thyme and then we're going to have lemon whose big chunks of lemon in just like that it's going to be so delicious and then maybe the last thing is a big chunk of garlic put a big chunk of it right in the middle of the turkey and then the last thing is I'm going to take these little wings and tuck them under just so they're not flapping around in the pan and that they they burn before the turkeys finish cooking you're basically just doing that because it turkey it doesn't mind so I've got about four tablespoons of butter i melted in here just brush it nicely on the outside of the bird okay good and then salt and pepper remember it's a big bird so salt it really well and some pepper in the pan so by two and a half hours of 350 degrees and we're gonna have a fabulous turkey with spinach gratin and smashed sweet potato the best thing about making things in advance or a party is it allows me plenty of time to relax member Hayes they hate spinach when you're a kid the spinach grant is so delicious that even the children will leave it not that a little bit so we've got the butter melted and about four cups of onions or do this for about 10-15 minutes over medium flame until the onions are really cooked but they're not browned so let that go for a little while and it's ready so this is the secret of this dish frozen spinach is just as good as fresh so much easier so I've got five packages of frozen spinach which is about three pounds just squeeze all the water out of this just really squeeze it so you've got all the liquid out and then put it in a bowl that's done onions are just cooking they're not browning which is to try I'm just off in a quarter of a cup of flour and then she really only just have to cook for about a minute until the flour is cooked in with that sort of raw flour taste added that 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg nutmeg sort of a classic thing with spinach and I think it's got great flavor so now I need a cup of heavy cream and two cups of milk and you know you really can make this with all milk but it's a special occasion someone make it with scream so that's probably going to take about five minutes for to heat up enough so it starts to thicken so it's not really thick it's not gluey it's just thickened great so the next thing is problems on cheese this is a chunk of Reggiano parmesan and it's really the best it's aged so it has great flavor but you can get grana you can get any kind of even Argentinian parmesan it's pretty good if you have a food processor it's a really easy way to do this but you can always do it with a box grater presto grated Parmesan so now I'm going to add half a cup of grated Parmesan it's the quarter cup measure SOPA to it tablespoon of kosher salt and a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and the last ingredient is spinach so I'm just going to break up this spinach and put it in and take it off the flame just mix the spinach in which I see how this all comes together much Paul this thin is just and absorb all that wonderful sauce and that's where I take the water out because at this point it would be like soup if you didn't okay into my pan I'm not going to cook this yet because it only takes 20 minutes to cook so I'll just set it aside until I'm ready to put it in the oven why do people only sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving I can't figure it out I think they're delicious so I've roasted these at 375 for about an hour and they're really done when they're nice and squishy and drizzle it with a little butter and salt and pepper they're wonderful but today I'm going to make smashed sweet potatoes because it's a special day these are cooled a little bit so I can handle them and I'm just going to take a spoon and scoop out the wonderful sweet potato flesh I'm going to have my friend Barbara's family who two gorgeous daughters and her new grandson some really fun and one more half and we're there okay now for all the flavorings that's a good part so the first thing is I need 1/2 a cup of orange juice and 1/2 a cup of heavy cream no wonder it tastes good right I'm just going to put in 2 tablespoons of butter teaspoon of nutmeg 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and the last thing is a quarter cup of brown sugar this is one of those recipes that just put some sweet potatoes in a mixer and I started adding things until I like to attest of life so you can turn the mixer on and miss the big homies gorgeous ingredients actually I'm a friend she doesn't recipe like this made bourbon how bad could that be New Orleans el-masri potatoes so what that sector of this to be really course but not not pureed I think baby food I like what it has some texture to it it just takes a minute in the mixer to do that looks so good mmm really brings out the sweet that it the sweetness and the sweet potatoes all the brown sugar and the orange you can taste all with it what's just wonderful nutmeg and cinnamon would be great with the dinner and this too it's a great dish for holiday entertaining or for any kind of entertaining for that matter you can make it in advance keep in the refrigerator I'm not going to cook it now I'm going to set it aside and I'll heat it up with a spinach Gretchen for about half an hour 375 [Music] [Music] so for my turkey dinner I think instead of doing flowers for the table I'm gonna do something more interesting which is all kinds of fresh fruit dried apricots and dried mango things can be really gorgeous [Music] [Music] hey gravy well it's not that I hate gravy I just hate that you make at the minute before you sit down you know here you are the turkeys hot your friends are hungry and I'm usually dressed in my party clothes and then I have to start making gravy I don't think so so I decided to find an easier way to do it the first thing I'm doing is sauteing about a cup and a half of onions in some butter and I like to saute them so they're really nice and translucent and maybe just a little bit brown the butter can brown a little bit it will make a dark gravy and this is my secret I saved the drippings from the last time I made turkey and I'll use that for making gravy this time this is old liked or just delicious steps in the gravy there's a little fat on the top so I'm just going to pour it out and just use the drippings at the bottom and I have here about two cups of chicken stock homemade chicken stock is great if you can't just use a really good can stock and I'm going to pour all of these drippings into that to really enrich it and give it lots of flavor now I need a little flour add a quarter cup of flour goes in with the cooked onions and butter and this is what's going to thicken the gravy okay cook that for about a minute and then I'm going to pour in this hot stock thicken up beautifully this is the way to prevent having 1'p gravy which is everybody's nemesis so that teaspoon of salt I like to use kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper when I did will try a quarter and see how it is just taste it as you go along very individual too and next is my secret ingredient I'm yack well cognac is really very good brandy from the cognac region so you can use any kind of brandy or con yet that you have around the house I love the smell of that connect when it hits the hot gravy it's fabulous some leftover white wants a little splash of white wine in that should be good and then the last thing is a little bit of heavy cream you can do this or not but I just think it enriches it enough so it really gives it special okay and then the good part I get to taste it's just gorgeous got all that coming a canned wine and the turkey juice and it just gonna be perfect so now I've got the roast turkey spinach Gretchen smashed sweet potatoes and the last thing I want to make is costs on bread pudding can't wait for dinner I want to ask my friends what their favorite dessert is they always say quad salt bread pudding so that's what we're going to make for dinner tonight and what's amazing is it's so easy so the first thing I to do is make the custard a three whole eggs and five egg yolks and I'm going to add in five cups of half-and-half I know I know it's a lot of half-and-half but I wouldn't recommend you eat this every day it's a special occasion whisk that in and then I need a cup and a half of sugar and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla the good news is you're not gonna believe how easy this is to make list on all of you really like a bread pudding except to Ike's turns turn up the volume and made it with cloths off so that's it for the custard so I'm going to get my dish ready I'm going to cut these costs on these are a little stale that came out of the freezer they were leftover you can use fresh cloth on but it's really better interesting would use stale ones because they're drier and they absorb that custard better I actually decided to try it with cross them because I thought their serve lighter and airier than bread and I thought it'd be really nice to see how it works I have about six cross on here but you can really use as many quests ons will fit in the pan you want two layers of cross on this has about a cup of raisins in it and I put the raisins actually between the layers of cross off because if they end up on top shell burn when I de then I'm going to put the second layer on you need to do with a brown side up or the brown side down but just do it consistently so it's the same all right now I put all this fabulous custard on pour over the whole thing now comes the fun part you have to just get the quest felt absorb all that custard by holding it down for a minute you can see the bubbles coming up so just it's absorbing all that gorgeous custard so let that soak for a minute while I get the water bath ready so sometimes a good idea when you're making custard to put it in water bath it actually keeps the temperature down a lot of people say you have to boil the water I just use really hot tap water easier the better I'm going to cover the pan not just the dish but the whole pan with foil put it into a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes and by then the custards going to start to set and then I'll take the foil off bake it for another 45 minutes and you'll see it's going to get really puffed and brown gorgeous you go carefully because you don't want water and cut you know you don't have to spend a fortune on table decoration you'd be surprised what you can find in the woods attended here love crabapples and now and we look at myself ready for the party expensive table winter when the flowers are expensive sometimes I like to go to the grocery store and get all kinds of decorations for the table I love winter colors purples and reds and oranges and twigs from my garden get some sort of a wintry feeling cornucopia delicious little treats like fresh fit and crystallized ginger dried applica and dried papayas and then everybody's got a little treat at the end of the meal for dessert so the quest on bread puddings been baking for about 45 minutes and 350 and now I'm going to take off the foil I'm going to bake another 45 minutes until it gets puffed and nicely browned will be delicious it was a turkey smells so good oh love not with gorgeous so I'm just going to wrap it up with aluminum foil really makes a difference if you let it rest for about 20 minutes which is perfect because that will give me enough time thinking it's the rest of the vegetables just what the juices get into the meat and the whole thing will taste fabulous my sweet potatoes and the spinach grits am just going to do a topping on the spinach grunta as though it needs extra flavor I'm going to put extra flavor on it so remember the spinach Gretchen has spinach and onions and I'm going to put about half a cup of grated Parmesan well maybe about a quarter of a cup should do it and I'm just going to do a little bit of grated Gruyere on top okay the two of these are gonna go into the oven we've got 375 for about 20 minutes and then they'll be good and hot for dinner [Music] get the question for it putting out of the oven so Gord I don't rest on top of the stone and now to carve the turkey i carve a turkey the same way I carve a chicken I'll show you what I do wanna take a length off relax perfectly cooked cause the dark needle of this okay cause it darkly first on the side okay then I'm going to carve this turkey breath because it would take a full breath off actually once you just what I do with a chicken so perfect should slice it how much easier do this one that works when the slices are so incredibly famous they'd fall apart just like that okay maybe a second pair here that's done so good finished sweet potatoes [Music] that was really fun as far abroad how do I pass the sweet potatoes nervous like I creamed spinach come on you emigrate a little bit right here in the grandeur [Music] good up to five o'clock this morning absolutely my mother to get up assignments with the turkey in the oven I don't understand it yes for dessert quest on bread pudding everybody's favorite assessment very large portion [Laughter] [Music] holiday we don't need like this there play dish [Music]
[Music] so the next thing I'm going to make would be great for food table at the gallery our spinach strudels and they're called spanakopita so the first thing I have here is one bunch of scallions chopped and got a half a cup of olive oil it's okay for about five minutes until the scallions are wilted and then two ten ounce box of the frozen chopped spinach just squeeze the liquid out not so it's bone-dry just as most of liquid is out in the second box sometimes people do this in a kitchen towel but you just row in the kitchen towel so just do it with your hand okay I'm going to take this sauteed onion and olive oil I'm just going to mix the cold spinach with a warm scallions I'm adding eggs next and I want them to scramble okay three eggs just whisk it mix it lightly and then just added to the finish and scallion okay mix that in so I'm going to add 8 ounces of feta to the Greek cheese goes with spinach strudels at 8 ounces right in okay mix that in now I'm going to add some fresh dill okay that should be like 2 tablespoons okay now salt and pepper 1/2 a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper and just mix it all up and that's the filling perfect okay so now for the phyllo dough show you what this is so it's in the freezer in the grocery store this is very very thin dough pastry showing a house in it is like paper thin that's okay yes I'm going to take one sheet or so it was melted butter just brush it all over but quickly and then the second sheet right on top going to place on top because the butter it won't slide right on top push that with melted butter so I'm piling up ten sheets of phyllo dough brushing those butter in between and sometimes with bread crumbs okay that's ten so I'm going to take a quarter of the filling and just run it right on the edge of the strudel and while I'm doing this we're going to take this damp cloth and put it right on top of the phyllo dough that I haven't used yet to keep it moist so pick up one corner and pull it right up over the filling and take the middle and if it tears don't worry about it you're just going to keep folding it rolling it up wanted to be even perfect okay some tickets true don't put it right on the baking sheet okay brush the top with butter so it gets nice and brown when it bakes and then with a sharp knife just going to score the top so after its baked it's very easy to cut I like to do diagonal slices if you'd like them any other way but anyway you like okay then I'm going to make the other four rolls and later these are going to bake at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes [Music]
[Music] you can't have an all-american grill without that macam burgers but of course I want them to be the best hamburgers I can make so I'm going to show you how to make really great hamburgers I actually like to combine two kinds of beef I do ground chuck so that it stays really moist in the bowl and this is the ground sirloin it's got a little more flavor than the ground chuck it's a little drier and the fun thing about this it's all about getting your hands into it next thing I have is two tablespoons the steak sauce how messy is that but it's really good and six egg yolks and the salt actually look like kosher salt it just has a little softer flavor than regular table salt use it and everything three-quarters of teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and this is the messy part clean hands really important in cooking and I just find if you use a fork this all gets mashed together but if you use your hands you can keep it really nice and light oh it's so squishy and cold this is the only way to make really good hamburgers and now for the real secret inside each hamburger I've put a little pad of butter so hamburger and just taking like a half of this bit of butter and put it right in the middle and when it sits on the grill it's gonna keep the hamburger so moist just wanna make sure it's totally enclosed in hamburger it's like hiding a secret in the middle of the hamburger isn't it like the Cracker Jack in the Box fabulous hamburgers ready for the grill so my friends are here on pending all-american grill and that requires hamburgers okay everybody hamburgers and turkey [Music] [Music]
I [Music] [Music] I'll use any excuse to throw party when my friends Michael and gym at bridgehampton floor has told me it was a 20th anniversary at the store I thought that's a great reason for a celebration Michael's going to set the table right in the store and I'm bringing dinner how fun is that to begin I'm making bruschetta is with roasted pepper and gorgonzola to serve with a glass of champagne then a light but delicious chicken salad Veronique with a tarragon sauce and green grapes plus a french-style potato salad with lots of green herbs and for dessert the best chocolate cake in the world from Michael's grandmother's recipe I love a party in a store after hours it's like being kids led into the candy store and this one has great flowers for decorations [Music] chicken salad Veronique it's like chicken salad but elevated to party food I thought Michael and Jim would really like it so the first thing i did was i roasted chicken breasts olive oil salt and pepper for 35 minutes at 350 degrees and it really makes the chicken so much moisture than poaching it let it cool little bit take the skin off so i'm just going to cube this i don't want too small but i want sort of bite-size pieces are perfect oh just right into the bone chicken still a little warm which is a great way to make the salad and then it really absorbs the flavor once it's cold it's firmer and it doesn't absorb the flavor so much so chicken salad Veronique I think comes from probably so Veronique which is classically made with grapes chicken has so much more flavor when it's roasted than it does when it's poached there's something about the water that just takes all the flavor out of it and there's something about the olive oil salt and pepper that gives it flavor so I think for tonight I'm going to do for chicken breasts ok now for the sauce so first have a cup of mayonnaise I'm going to put it right into the bowl and toss it all together okay now some green things so first how are gone which is a really delicate herb want to have tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves this really is the place for fresh herbs just going to chop it up it's most wonderful I think you've really underused or tarragona okay the next thing is celery in the category of lots of green things gonna run my knife right down the middle leave it attached on the top and just okay right in I'll do two stars or celery it's about 1 cup of salary but the good news is you can do as much as you like okay that should be just about 1 cup and now comes the varunee part green grapes so I need about 1 cup of green grapes cut in half or make sure you see the scrapes nobody wants to be crunching their chicken salad this cell is sit very well too because all the flavors the tarragon will really get into the chicken and the sweetness of the grapes okay that's it for the grapes a little salt and pepper we're gonna have teaspoons of salt I know it sounds odd to have soft and grapes together but really brings out the flavor of them 1 teaspoon of pepper cross it all together and that's chicken salad technique I have been buying incredible flowers from Michael and Jim for 20 years can't wait to see you soon the table and what do I think it end Falls orange roses or orange tulips thank you so much a nice day bye good night perfectly took potato now Americans think of potato salad is being drenched in the mayonnaise dressing French potato salad has a vinaigrette with lots of fresh shirt and love it so cook the potatoes for about 20 to 30 minutes into the perfectly tender whoo and my secret are really perfectly cooked potatoes is drain them and then put a clean kitchen towel right over it and all the steam gets really into the middle of it and they end up perfectly cooked so I'm going to make a vinaigrette for this potato salad first thing I need is some fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons it's barely half a lemon [Music] two cloves of garlic it is French after all it's got it lots of flavor so when the potatoes are a little cool that we slice them and I'm going to soak them with white wine and chicken stock and all that flavor gets really into the potatoes it's wonderful ok to close the chopped garlic right into it half teaspoon of Dijon mustard two teaspoons of salt three quarters of a teaspoon of pepper and two-thirds of a cup of olive oil which we just drizzle and very slowly while I whisk it it'll make a nice to take vinaigrette okay that's done next time we'll slice the potatoes and mix it with lots of fresh green herbs [Music] you [Music] hmm okay almost done with the potatoes so there's three pounds of potatoes perfectly cooked you can use small white potatoes red potatoes Yukon Gold potatoes if you can find them ok so the potatoes are still a little warm and then put a splash of white wine but two tablespoons on top when they warm the white one really soaks in two tablespoons of chicken stock if all made it's always better mmm I can smell the white wine when it hits the warm potatoes so I need 3 tablespoons of parsley ok ok 3 tablespoons that's about 3 tablespoons right in 3 tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves seems to be a theme here tarragon is not used very much it's kind of a much more subtle herb than those that's sort of almost like an anise flavor pull them off the stems chop them up ok that's about 3 tablespoons right into the potatoes and then just to give it a little heat got a quarter of a cup of chopped red onion a little spice don't want a to settle and this you want to mince them because you can be really eating raw red onion weren't really sort of finely minced right in about making salad just toss everything in one bowl and mix it up and let the flavors blend it's not like baking where you don't know whether it's good until it's done just go toss this all together see they've completely absorbed this looks pretty good actually okay vinaigrette with mustard and garlic good olive oil just enough so it soaks in see I'm just mix it hmm Michael on come on I'm so used to doing this for other people sending their table during their flowers now I get to do it for myself I hope I'm is pleased with what we're doing it should be a fun evening I thought I'd surprise Michael engine with a cake for their anniversary party so it's one in three-quarters cup of flour let's if all the dry ingredients together two cups of sugar and then sip some right into the bowl mixing bowl this is a chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream it's got three quarters of a cup of cocoa powder dark chocolate cocoa powder I'm smell so good so chocolaty okay one teaspoon of baking powder 2 teaspoons of baking soda it helps it rise one teaspoon of salt I'm just going to sift all these together so the method of this cake is to sift all the dry ingredients together in a cloud of chocolate and then I'm going to slowly mix the wet ingredients into it okay as the dry ingredients just going to mix them on the mixer until their combined okay now for the wet ingredients the first thing is a cup of buttermilk I always shake it it does settle make sure it's well mixed so I'm going to do it in a measuring cup it'll be easier to pour into the cake batter so I mean one cup of buttermilk half a cup of vegetable oil two eggs just beat the eggs a little brands of the wet ingredients I use extra-large eggs once it's pretty good vanilla really important when you're doing chocolate okay just going to combine these and then with the mixer on low i'm just going to put it into the dry mixture and then I have secret ingredient or i should say Michaels grandmother had a secret ingredient this recipe calls for a cup of hot brewed coffee and I always think coffee is really important for chocolate it wants to taste really chocolatey and that's exactly what this does right into the mixture ok let's go scrape down the paddle make sure it's really well mixed okay I'm clear the decks I've got two 8-inch cake pans I live in the parchment paper butter and flour pressures on it has to be good because Michael knows exactly what it is he actually served this cake to me once at dinner and I just begged him for the recipe I didn't have to bake very hard well make sure they're pretty equal size okay into the oven 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and then we're going to cover it with the easiest most delicious butter can ever seen [Music] so since the chocolate cake is really just a delivery system for really good chocolate buttercream this cake has one of the best I've ever had so the topic 6-ounce is a really good semi-sweet chocolate and I'm just going to melt the chocolate in a bowl that I've said over simmering water and the meantime going to start the rest of the buttercream so I need two sticks of butter half a pound at room temperature just going to beat that on medium speed okay the next thing I need is one extra-large egg yolk and a teaspoon of good vanilla extract okay i think the chocolates going to be ready by now let's see take this off the heat and just let the chocolate cool while I turn the cakes out the great way to take cakes as just wrap it on the bottom and a board like that and then very often they just cannot beautifully perfect question comes off just added to the butter and vanilla so I've got two teaspoons of hot water I'm just going to put a tablespoon of instant coffee powder which is a very intense coffee just melt this together and pour it into the buttercream okay and I'm just going to whip it for a minute make sure it's really well blended no turn on low and they're all this gorgeous chocolate the chocolate is actually cooled now a little bit you know want to pour hot chocolate into butter otherwise the whole thing will melt let's know the chocolate and the coffee together little hint of vanilla and that's Michaels grandmother's chocolate butter time I think he's going to be really surprised not look gorgeous mmm and now we're going to put it on the cake in the second layer top side up so it's nice and rounded like an old-fashioned cake second-quarter cream I see a cake just go over it very gently start from the top and work your way down the sides at the parchment give a little piece of parchment paper on the plate to keep the plate Queen ok so now I've got buttercream on all sides of the cake I'm just going to go up and down the sides and good news about an old-fashioned cake is it supposed to be a little messy and then I'm just going to smooth the top just sort of big swirls okay just going to take the parchment paper route just run my knife right along the edge and the paper just comes right out [Music] I can't wait to deserve I always like to serve one small thing with cocktails not ten different things that take forever to make with just one really good tasting thing so for Michael and Jim's I thought I'd make bruschetta and what their sketch of means is grilled bread I'm just going to roast it in the oven is a little olive oil salt and pepper and then I'm gonna make a delicious very Italian tapping okay i need about 18 slices of a sheet pan I just find it with parchment paper because it's easier to clean so okay 18 slices just a new brush with olive oil and then afterwards I'm gonna make a wonderful topping sauteed peppers and creamy gorgonzola so good together salt pepper okay into the oven 375 degrees for about 7 to 10 minutes and then have delicious crisper it but my topping on [Music] so now for the good stuff the topic for the bruschetta so I'm going to make sautéed peppers just going to saute them quickly an olive oil salt and pepper a little bit of sugar actually to caramelize them just to touch you won't even taste it you can do strips of peppers just for color I did one yellow pepper in one red pepper okay so I'm just going to get the olive oil hot and then with the peppers in saute them for about 12 to 15 minutes while those cook them Lee get some other things together for the topping [Music] well these peppers are looking so good nice and brown I'm gonna caramelize them just a little more teaspoon of sugar in I know that sounds unlikely but it really gives them a really nice caramel color flavor and you'll never notice it okay a few more things quarter of a cup of chopped basil that never heard anything two tablespoons of capers drained just cuz it for a minute or two okay time to assemble them the toasts out of the oven and okay each toast a little bit of pepper ok first basil a little bit of cork and so on and then as soon as i'm done i melt the gorgonzola on the up and don't think that's terrific [Music] okay into the oven 375 for two three four minutes just until the gorgonzola starts to melt and then I'm going to pack everything up and take it off to Michael engines this looks amazing doesn't it I kind of surprise for you but you're not allowed to open I can't can't be don't even luck okay buddy stuff from the car grease right back

bringing dinner how fun is that to begin I'm making bruschetta is with roasted pepper and gorgonzola to serve with a glass of champagne then a light but delicious chicken salad Veronique with a

thought Michael and Jim would really like it so the first thing i did was i roasted chicken breasts olive oil salt and pepper for 35 minutes at 350 degrees and it really makes the chicken so much moisture than poaching it let cool little bit take the skin off so i'm just going to cube this sound of one or two small but i want sort of bite-sized pieces are perfect oh just right into the bowl chicken still a little warm which is a great way to make the salad and then it really absorbs the flavor once it's cold it's firmer and it doesn't absorb the flavor so much so chicken salad Veronique I think comes from probably so Veronique which is classically made with grapes taking us so much more flavor when it's roasted than it does when it's poached there's something about the water that just takes all the flavor out of it and there's something about the olive oil salt and pepper that gives it flavor so I think for tonight I'm going to do for chicken breasts ok not for the sauce so first have a cup of mayonnaise I'm just going to put it right into the bowl and toss it all together ok now some green things so first our gun which is a really delicate herb when they have tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves this really is the place for fresh herbs just go chop it up it's most wonderful I think so really underused herbs tarragon ok the next thing is celery in the category of lots of green things gonna run my knife right down the middle leave it attached on the top and just chop it up okay right in I'll do two stalks of celery it's about 1 cup of celery but the good news is you can do as much alike okay that should be just about one cup and now comes the veronique part green grapes so I need about 1 cup of green grapes cut in half want to make sure you seal the scrapes nobody wants to be crunching their chicken salad this sal is sit very well too because all the flavors tarragon will really get into the chicken and the sweetness of the grapes okay that's it for the grapes a little salt and pepper we're going to have teaspoons of salt and it sounds odd to have soft and grapes together but really brings out the flavor of them 1 teaspoon of pepper toss it all together and that's chicken salad their unique I have been buying incredible flowers from Michael unjam for 20 years can't wait to see you soon the table and what do I think it in Falls orange roses or orange tulips thank you so much sir nice day to provide good night perfectly took potato now Americans think of potato salad is being drenched in a mayonnaise dressing French potato salad has it been a gret with lots of fresh shirt and love it so I cook the potatoes for about 20 to 30 minutes into their perfectly tender and my secret to really perfectly cooked potatoes is drain them and then put a clean kitchen towel right over it and all the steam gets really into the middle of it and they end up perfectly cooked so I'm going to make a vinaigrette for this potato salad first thing I need is some fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons it's really half eleven two cloves of garlic it is French after all it's got have lots of flavor so when the potatoes are a little cool that will slice them and I'm gonna soak them with white wine and chicken stock and all that flavor gets really into the potatoes it's wonderful ok to close the chopped garlic right into it half teaspoon of Dijon mustard two teaspoons of salt three-quarters of a teaspoon of pepper and two-thirds of a cup of olive oil it's only just drizzle and very slowly while I whisk it it'll make a nice thick vinaigrette okay that's done [Music] [Music] I'll use any excuse to throw a party when my friends Michael and Jim every champion floor has told me it was a 20th anniversary at the store I thought that's a great reason for a celebration Michael's going to set the table right in the store a nun bringing dinner how fun is that to begin I'm making bruschetta with roasted pepper and gorgonzola to serve with a glass of champagne then a light but delicious chicken salad Veronique with the tarragon sauce and green grapes plus a french-style potato salad with lots of green herbs and for dessert the best chocolate cake in the world from Michael's grandmother's recipe I love a party in the store after-hours it's like being kids led into the candy store and this one has great flowers for decorations [Music] chicken salad Veronique it's like chicken salad but elevated to party food I thought Michael and Jim would really like it so the first thing i did was i roasted chicken breasts olive oil salt and pepper for 35 minutes at 350 degrees and it really makes the chicken so much moisture than poaching it let it cool little bit take the skin off so i'm just going to cube this sound of one or two small but i want sort of bite-sized pieces are perfect no just right into the bowl chicken still a little warm which is a great way to make the salad and then it really absorbs the flavor once it's cold it's firmer and it doesn't absorb the flavor so much so chicken salad Veronique I think comes from probably so Veronique which is classically made with grapes chicken s so much more flavor when it's roasted than it does when it's poach there's something about the water that just takes all the flavor out of it and there's something about the olive oil salt and pepper that gives it flavor so I think for tonight I'm going to do for chicken breasts ok now for the sauce so first half a cup of mayonnaise I'm going to put it right into the bowl and toss it all together okay now some green things so first our gun which is a really delicate herb when I have tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves this really is the place for fresh herbs just going to chop it up it's most wonderful I think you've really underused herbs tarragon okay the next thing is celery in the category of lots of green things going to run my knife right down the middle leave it attached on the top and just chop it up okay right in LG two stars of celery it's about 1 cup of celery but the good news is you can do as much as you like okay that should be just about one cup and now comes the veronique part green grapes so I need about 1 cup of green grapes cut in half or make sure you seal the scrapes nobody wants to be crunching their chicken salad this cell is sit very well too because all the flavors tarragon will really get into the chicken and the sweetness of the grapes okay that's it for the grapes a little salt and pepper we're going to have teaspoons of salt and it sounds odd to have soft and grapes together but really brings out the flavor of them 1 teaspoon of pepper toss it all together and that's chicken salad technique I have been buying incredible flowers from Michael unjam for 20 years can't wait to see you soon the table and what do I think it in Falls orange roses or orange tulips thank you so much very nice day bye good night perfectly took potato now Americans think of potato salad is being drenched in a mayonnaise dressing French potato salad has a vinaigrette with lots of fresh shirt and love it so cook the potatoes for about 20 to 30 minutes until they're perfectly tender and my secret of really perfectly cooked potatoes is drain them and then put a clean kitchen towel right over it and all the steam gets really into the middle of it and they end up perfectly cooked so I'm going to make a vinaigrette for this potato salad first thing I need is some fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons valley half a lemon two cloves of garlic it is French after all it's gotta have lots of flavor so when the potatoes are a little cool that will slice them and I'm going to soak them with white wine and chicken stock and all that flavor gets really into the potatoes it's wonderful ok to close the chopped garlic right into it half teaspoon of Dijon mustard two teaspoons of salt three quarters of a teaspoon of pepper and two-thirds of a cup of olive oil which we've just drizzle and very slowly while I whisk it I will make an finna grip okay that's done next time a slice of potatoes and mix it with lots of fresh green herbs [Music] hm okay almost done with the potatoes so three pounds of potatoes perfectly cooked you can use small white potatoes red potatoes Yukon Gold potatoes if you can find them ok so the potatoes are still a little warm and then put a splash of white wine but two tablespoons on top when they're warm the white wine really soaks in two tablespoons of chicken stock if homemade it's always better mmm I can smell the white wine when it hits the warm potatoes so I need 3 tablespoons of parsley ok now put three tablespoons that's about 3 tablespoons right in 3 tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves seems to be a theme here tarragon is not used very much it's kind of a much more subtle herb than most that's sort of almost like an anise flavor just pull them off the stems chop them up ok that's about 3 tablespoons right into the potatoes and then just to give it a little heat put a quarter of a cup of chopped red onion little spice don't want to sew and this you want to mince up because you're gonna be really eating raw red onion what I really sort of finely minced

planning lots of fun maybe a little romance I hope you'll love the toppings I've come up with for French Open sandwiches and enjoy the simple meal of lemon chicken with croutons caramelized shallots and wonderful French string beans I'll be having some guests over for the easiest cocktail party ever that works just as well on both sides of the Atlantic and gathering the ingredients for an absolutely no cook picnic join Jeffrey meet our favorite cafe and stay as I recreate the magic of Paris back in East Hampton with a meal of herb baked eggs on Devon Rockford salad and sinful profiteroles with chocolate sauce Paris is a food town and I'm on a mission I'm going to turn inspiration here into reality in my kitchen meas Hampton join me it's going to be so much fun you [Music] you when I'm in the street market in Paris I'm in heaven that is some friends tales tonight I thought I'm just going to come and see what looks delicious and served with drinks maybe some olives some cashews sometimes I like cucumber and sausage together whatever looks good with a glass of champagne it's going to be a perfect party from your guitar since I disagree c'est parfait let's see come sir because you see zip pocket except mom oh this looks wonderful it's got fresh herbs and fresh goat cheese slices of french toast to the perfect for dessert and now small six football netsy mission that's my French is really bad cucumber to go with the salami will cut a would be nice next super cool hunter named Adam let's see this could be a fun party [Music] so here's our secret to making it really easy cocktail party make one thing and assemble the rest so the one thing I've made is tapenade which is an olive paste it's really easy to make and I can make it a few days in advance that's done and all kinds of assembled things and the good news is I can make the same kind of party on both sides of the Atlantic some pate remember the potato Campania whoa okay I'm just going to cucumbers with salami and just spread the top knot right onto French bread okay maybe some black olives I have these gorgeous cherry tomatoes spread on the tray and some green olives okay and then maybe some slices of French bread under the tomatoes can always find space a little of our fresh goat cheese okay and the cashews and I think they have a party only use the guests [Music] everybody to Paris great friends thank you so much for coming Cheers I'd like to say that I spend all day making Pat's head I spent all day at the market and some tapenade Canyon meal some tapenade q cheers everyone thank you so much for Paris make it so much fun so you know what I said about entertaining on both sides of the Atlantic I'm going to give exactly the same cocktail party at given Paris here in East Hampton including the tapenade this is a half a pound of dollars so right into the food processor and you want them drained okay next thing is three tablespoons of capers and I've drained them just right in and show v's I know they taste like hairy fish but when they're in this they're really good so the salt and the flavor of the fish so eight anchovies take good anchovies bad anchovies can be really bad and the next thing is garlic and of anything from Provence about garlic I'm just going to smash it because it's really going to get pureed in the food processor okay so I'm just going to curate that up really rough just like a rough chop and I'm just going to add some other ingredients some lemon a 2 tablespoons handy dandy marina mer at 2 tablespoons you can just do it approximately 2 teaspoons of good Dijon mustard 1/2 a cup of good olive oil it's actually another ingredient that's really important for it to taste good okay now we've got to have some herbs if it's Provence all right it's a little fresh thyme just the leaves in like that and I'm looking some fresh parsley this is flat leaf parsley which I think there's a little more flavor than the curly parsley and for this dish would be perfect just a handful of that that's it you don't want to puree just want roughly chopped so it's a little piece of bread either toasted or plain love it [Music] same party different times and just as much fun cheers here's to East Hampton NPR's [Music] in Paris I take inspiration everywhere when I come to the boulevard rest by market I love to see these rotisserie chickens going around and all those gorgeous juices falling on the potatoes no fabulous and when I went home I thought wouldn't it be great to have break cubes underneath and that's how roast chicken with croutons was born it's so delicious chickens croutons work for town or simple lunch like staying with my friend Anna shows up I'm gonna stuff the inside with lemon just put them right inside it's got a really good flavor so pepper and it's the pan great so I'm going to roast at 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes until it's just perfectly done and then I'm going to sautee bread croutons and when the chicken is roasted I want to slice it over the croutons so it just absorbs all that gorgeous chicken juice with flavors so for the croutons I'm going to use a sourdough bread like this you can get them all over the country but it reminds me so much of this wonderful bread can fall on bakery that I love in Paris [Music] this is Paul on it's probably the most famous bread shop in the world they're famously huge loaves of sourdough bread and they are so delicious you can buy them in lots of places the United States you could also have them shipped overnight to your door which you see the bread ovens downstairs they can put 48 of these incredible loaves in at one time [Music] nextdoor to pull on they make these wonderful open-faced sandwiches called tartines all different kinds of flavors and they're really inspiring to me they're great first course a nice light lunch that looks great [Music] so one of the things we do here is we make sandwiches are like big thick roast beef sandwiches in France as we just saw they make really thin ones and you really taste the ingredients so I want to make my two favorite ones goat cheese with tomatoes and smoked salmon so I've toasted the bread a little bit and then I'm just going to spread some of them with herb goat cheese good thing about tartines is you can go through the fridge read and see what you have left over it could be brie and tomato basil whatever you want okay and then I'm going to put tomatoes on it's going to be a great first course okay under the broiler and then I'll make smoked salmon ones few minutes that's going to be really nice and bubbly hot okay so I've got the toasted bread good smoked salmon Oh sliced and nice long slices okay the next thing is sliced cucumbers just be creative about this like an herb butter on it or a little even guacamole anything like that just make it really delicious I think I'm going to do some lemon and I was like pepper on salmon so going to the black pepper and I love the way the woman call on cut it up on a plate so I think I'm doing something so let me see how this works just like in Paris Oh perfect is grade the heat sort of willfully robo a little bit these tartines are going to be perfect starter my dinner with Hana but right now I have to clear the decks and get ready for caramelized shallots and French string beans [Music] come on shallots they're so good and they're really easy to make 3 tablespoons of butter one of our tablespoons of sugar is to make the cowboy part and then I've got shallots that I've actually already peeled actually feeling relating them with you and onion the fast way is dunfin boiling water it's about 30 seconds and the tips comes right off so with these cook until they get brown on all sides and if they start to caramelize so I'm going to sit in one and a half tablespoons of red wine vinegar okay into the oven 400 degrees for about fifteen to thirty minutes until they're really just tender so I've got some haricots vert and they're great on their own but I'm going to give them more flavor by doing roasted peppers and onions and then heat them all up together at the last minute and it's going to be so good as we great with roasted chicken okay I'm going to roast half a yellow pepper half a red pepper big chunks just cut it in like six pieces big one like that and then one red onion let's cut it in half take the peel off and also in big chunks oh those onions always make me cry okay put them on a roasting pan a little olive oil salt and pepper tossing around clean hands always help where those onions are strong into the oven 425 degrees for about 15 or 20 minutes into this sort of browned and delicious [Music] [Music] nothing like gross checking in at the house smell good so I'm just going to cover this with foil that that's all the juices back into the meat makes it really moist that's what it is it was just enough time to make the croutons so three times slice the bread and big cubes [Music] I think half a loaf is enough for two people and I don't mind it with a crust on if you prefer without the crust just cut it off but I love the earthy way above it's a great way to use up leftover bread just a little film of oil in the pan get it really hot and then just put all the bread cubes I want them in one layer just saute them medium heat just keep turning them until they're nice and browned on all sides and then when I slice the chicken over the bread cubes on the platter all that gorgeous juice from the chicken and the lemon is going to get into the cubes it's gonna be really good and really do this with any kind of bread like a baked add or sourdough bread or a big white bread make sure it's really good [Music] [Music] such an everyday mmm that smells so good that's okay well it's a French inspired meal so I'm making roast chicken on a bed of croutons and it's constantly down shadows a little liner twist on a French meal and for his string beans and it's with you in mind here okay I think that's a little glass of wine and some tripe teen for you I'm gonna go get the chicken radio sounds great okay I'll be right back all right I just love honor I think she's inspired me more than anybody else I know but now I could get lunch ready serious stuff just going to cut this up put it right on top of the croutons and then all the juices from the chicken are going to get into the croutons it's all the lemon the chicken pieces mmm the breasts I'm going to do is I'm going to cut it all off in one piece and then slice it in that way everybody gets a little bit of it neat and a little bit of the skin [Music] I'm just going to put the roasted lemons on the fire show Thank You Blanche for about three minutes and then I have the roast vegetables put them right on top okay well that's it up I'm going to get the shower from the bowl work with the ground caramelize these are they're going to so visit the chicken may contribute to lunch I'm a lunch is ready Please Please Me badd yes okay fabulous would be fine is just a beautiful who would like it Oh yourself it's so wonderful some little chicken pieces and croutons what a surprise that's a family show so wonderful I know you feel exactly the same way I do I can't go to Paris oh they'll be inspired by something food the flowers just the warmth and the style the people and of course the divine cheers to Paris when we come to Paris Jeffrey's always asking me to do a picnic so I'm going to do a totally no cook picnic and we're going to meet up later at the plum Bazaar which is a footbridge over the set it's doing really lovely the first I need some Tomatoes this is not only and about not cooking this is about not arranged and we're just going to open the packages and even as is to be so good that looks like a really good great excellent but everything was french stream market even wine a nice slice of ham is made perfectly the picnic [Music] you know everybody talks about a picnic you think big baskets red check-plus forget it find a really gorgeous spot and somebody you love and you just get a whole bunch of things and make it really casual and somebody who loves somebody and definitely somebody loves picnics and you start with good wine so what else you have I've got some good brie no plates no knives it's all finger food that looks great okay take a bite ya know it's a ticket for you can't eat it it's actually great it's very good French ham oh this looks good very rested evidence of your hands look at that tomato it's not gorgeous look beautiful Cheers that's picnic maker right now I hope I'm the only big menu now I'll have it anywhere it's so good [Music] and love Paris and love French food I'm not talking about fancy food with complicated sauces I'm talking about really simple French food I'm making Geoffrey dinner tonight that's going to take them right back there herb baked eggs on beef with Roquefort salad and for dessert profiteroles you won't believe how easy it is hey I'm already there right in the heart of Paris on the left bank is the most amazing store like Rhonda pizzeria it's one of my favorite food stores in the world you can find everything your heart desires here and a few things you didn't even know you needed aren't these pastries just amazing one of my mottos is my friends don't have more fun if I spent the day making dessert so if it's complicated I'll come here and buy a French tart or if I want to make it easy I'll make profiteroles at home [Music] after admit I used to think of making French pastries really daunting but I found if you can make one simple thing contest choux which is a sweet dough I can make lots of different things and today I'm going to make Federal's so what I have in here is quarter of a pound of butter a cup of milk and a pinch of salt and it's heated until just below the boiling point and now we're going to add a cup of flour so I know this sounds strange but dump the whole thing in at once and just start stirring it and it's going to pull together into a dough just beat it with a wooden spoon over very low heat for about two minutes and you'll see it'll start to coat the bottom of the pan say you get your exercise so about two minutes you see it just starts just coat the pan a little bit okay done now this is going to go right into the food processor just dump it right in now I need four eggs in room temperature just going to dump it right on top of the hot dough and then plus it takes it's now going for the dough into this pastry bag I have a round tip it's maybe half an inch round and show you it's actually very big tip into the pastry bag I'm going to turn down the top exit neater and just take some of the dough put it right into the bag this dough will make 18 small or 12 large profiteroles nothing for jefra nor mike leake ones and just two mounds right in the middle just like that the good news is if you make a mistake just take the dough put it right back in the pastry bag the other good news is you can make them in advance and freeze them okay now a little trick about these little points at the top is dip your finger in water and just press down the top so otherwise the whole point will bake faster or a little burn okay into the oven for twenty five for 20 minutes and they're going to be big and puffed and golden and then I'm going to fill them with ice cream and cover them in chocolate sauce next tray the Paris is not just food ideas I get for entertaining it's flower ideas as well and this is my favorite flower shop Marianne robic Wow a friend of mine says that you don't choose the flowers here they choose you I know what she means I want them all so it turns out with flowers just like food the simplest ideas are the best Mariana's taught me so many secrets about how to do flowers really simply this is one of them is to take one color like this pale pink and mix all different kinds of flowers in the same color this is peonies and roses and sweet peas and it's gorgeous [Music] another thing Marianas taught me is you take one flower and do masses of it like these hydrangeas aren't they amazing of course a huge boss like that doesn't hurt and then some of the best ideas are right in front of you in the grocery store or in your garden this is fresh mint with masses of peonies love the way it smells I love the way it looks it's not great so the one idea I'm going to bring back in Paris is one color lots of different flowers it's not easy but I'm going to try and do it so of course my favorite flower color is orange so I'm going to start with orange tulips and the way they do it in France is they take the lower leaves off so you just hold them together the way you hold a bridal bouquet together and just have all the flowers at the same height the stems are all going to be different but the heights going to be the same and then on Rose just put them all together and then just look at them and see if it what's pretty what some things are small and leafy like this to fill in the spaces so you mix big flowers little flowers things that have green on them so just keep turning the bouquet around and any things as you go and just keep looking at it make sure it's really pretty I've stood for hours French florists watching them do this and it's the only way to learn so I need a little red in here it's a little web vernacular there now I'm going to take some string and wrap it right around the center really it's like a bridal bouquet okay so now what I'm going to do is cut all the stems off at exactly the same height put them in an angle it allows the flowers to drink more water okay let's see how this works I always seem to get the wrong size bajas the first time yep that's the wrong one the mouth is too big so they don't stand up well this one's too small so let me see I think exactly the way this is like it should do it so want to fill it with room temperature water not too hot not too cold flowers drink it best that way okay let's try this that's the right size but I think the flowers are too tall but look better if they sit a little lower that's the good news about flowers you can keep cutting them just don't want to cut them too short [Music] a okay that's right [Music] the French love good cheese and they do it so well my favorite thing is to buy cheese but I also love to just go in and just smell the aroma I'd like to try new things but I also like my old favorites like Roquefort Wow there really is nothing like a French cheese shop but you can still get a lot of good cheese's in the United States no I have a three cheese rule if you've got three really different cheeses hard cheese a soft cheese and a blue cheese you can do anything to make salads you can cook you can set up a cheese platter but right now I'm going to see what kind of great cheese's I can find what do you recommend so we can start by this one okay goat cheese it's the chef oh I know that she's oh yes see hmm but such bright flavor and the texture is amazing yes very milky very milky you enter that great bite with very creamy yes perfect so what else for hard cheese son else it's made like a cheddar this perfect thank you hmm now I know exactly what the third cheese's workforce my favorite it's just wonderful I think I'll just take that piece useful yes and I think we have three different ends with sheep's milk cheese a cow's enough cheese and the goat's milk cheese to work we've got it okay I'll take all three thank you that was fun say fromage good news about French cheeses you can get right here in America I'm going to make one of my favorite salads with French Roquefort cheese its rope repairs on deve and walnuts with a lemon vinaigrette it's so good so I've made it in many variations but this is my favorite so first of the vinaigrette three tablespoons of champagne vinegar one and a half teaspoons of Dijon mustard one egg yolk when a room-temperature egg yolk it's kind of like making mayonnaise if you don't want to use a raw egg yolk you can always just use a tablespoon of mayonnaise works one-and-a-half teaspoons of salt 3/4 of teaspoon of pepper just going to whisk that all together and again like make the mayonnaise I'm going to very slowly add 3/4 of a cup of olive oil and then the egg is going to make it emulsified so a little thicker than a normal vinaigrette just slowly at it just like that so the same process is making a mayonnaise we end up with the vinaigrette that's nice and thick that's gorgeous okay great and then later and slice the pears I'm gonna slice the aund Eve crumble up the blue cheese and the walnuts have been nice and toasted so they're really crisp I'm going to assemble the whole thing for dinner for Jeffrey me [Music] another night like how much you want to sit here and you know when we come back from Paris our friends always ask where'd you go to dinner they're expecting us a four-star restaurant but the truth is we really love the bistros and brasseries really low-key places but I'd say our secret place is coming to café de Flore and having a glass of champagne and an omelette for late supper maybe too much maybe two glasses let's eat new balls let's eat okay - Anya is on let me see so with the order I ordered two sister champagne and two omelets with ham and cheese so lucky right now oh shit mr. Bishop [Music] a yes big so there are two secrets to make really good omelets the first one is cook it over a very low flame so it doesn't get tough which they did and the second one is to undercook it just a little bit so it's really delicious and moist and I'd say they know how to make a good omelet they know how to make it off someone approaches your omelette it's the highest level maybe I'd like something like this at home maybe with baked eggs instead of omelettes oh that sounds delicious what so I'm going to curb bagged eggs for Jeffrey me watch how easy this is Freight so when mixed together a quarter of a teaspoon of first time in this bowl quarter of teaspoon of fresh rosemary there's all kinds of fun trips when you use a judiciously because it's such a stronger up and be sure that you chop it really well into Bowl quarter teaspoon first garlic this has all kinds of Provencal flavors in it one tablespoon of chopped parsley you can either use that leaf or curly parsley I kind of like a rough chop isn't going to be too finely chopped 1 tablespoon of parsley and 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese just be sure you use good fresh Parmesan cheese okay so these are the gratin dishes that the eggs are going to go into and I'm going to crack three eggs into each Bowl one do it really carefully see don't break the yolks so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a little bit of butter put it in the grate and dish a little bit of cream too strong oops do this on a tray maybe it's a little pieces of toast on the server VX well put these in the broiler for about three minutes until the dish gets really hot and the butter is nice and bubbly and then when the eggs get obstructed [Music] so the cream butter for the eggs probably done perfect it's nice and hot and bubbly I'm going to carefully slide the eggs into each one so don't break the yolks I'll just start to cook immediately the dish is really hot and then when put on my mixture of thyme garlic rosemary parsley and Parmesan / Provence all salt and pepper into the broiler for about five minutes until it's hot and bubbly and delicious okay so I have my vinaigrette which is observed creamy white wine vinaigrette made champagne vinegar and on deva leaves I'm just coffee ends put some leaves right on the plate you can pick them in half lengthwise but I kind of like the way they look with them home okay so that's the Andy and then the next thing I do is crumbled blue cheese and you can really just do this with your hands this is a really good work for cheese for the best that's one of the great cheeses of the world okay so the next thing I'm going to do is pears I like to cut it this way just in wedges you can see it's really juicy so I'm just going to dunk it in the vinaigrette the acidity of the vinaigrette is going to keep it from getting brown the tariffs are artfully on the plate with on D and the bleu cheese so it's pretty good and then one once I run them so they're a little crisper and they have more flavor and just right on top [Music] I'm so starting on friction so now for the profiteroles I'm going to make chocolate sauce anything tastes better with chocolate sauce on it I need 1/2 a cup of heavy cream I'm going to heat it over double boiler and you can use a traditional double boiler you just can take any kind of a heatproof bowl and just set it over simmering water 12 ounces of chopped but semi-sweet chocolate chips are great they use bar chocolate I'm just going to let that sit over simmering water and then later I'm going to flavor it with coffee of honey and give it a really deep flavor so I've got the federal Puffs ice cream inside and chocolate sauce on the top it's actually good all-purpose chocolate sauce good over ice cream for last-minute dessert now can still pull it all together makes it perfect whites affirm and the yolks are still soft salads very fresh Jeff relaxant so very comfortable sitting in that spring a French inspired flower he got this I had baked eggs with premises are lovely and then later the way the French have a salad after the meal I mean I have an on beef salad with blue cheese and that is just delicious it's an undo sell tofu cheese walnuts and pears South Korean make you see what's for dessert I can't imagine how you're going to top this the eggs in this I mean what what what do you what do you have to surprise and you want me to support all snow there's the chocolate sauce so I have the melted chocolate and cream and I'm just gonna add some flavors 2 tablespoons of good honey this is not only good honey but it's slow honey okay two tablespoons of messy honey and two tablespoons of hot prepared coffee if you don't have prepared coffee you can always use instant coffee and just mix it all together so now that chocolate has a really nice depth of flavor as the honey makes a little sweet that's just perfect okay now I'm going to assemble the profiteroles so I'm going take two on each plate I think so these were hot but they've cooled you don't want to put ice cream into a hopper for the roll I let the ice cream out for a little while so it's a little softened actually tastes better when it's not so cold one scoop in each before I put the lid on onto the plate and how adorable these chocolate sauce and they were already profiteroles with the chocolate sauce yeah and profiteroles for this area whoops does this remind you of Paris well with a little a little imagination I could be there right now [Music] I love Paris Jeffrey and I have been coming here for 30 years

this could be fun party so he could make it really easy cocktail party make one thing and assemble the rest so the one thing I've made is tapenade which is an olive paste it's really easy to make and I can make it a few days in advance that's done and all kinds of assembled things and the good news is I can make the same kind of party on both sides of the Atlantic some pate remember the potato Campania whoa okay I'm just going to cucumbers with salami and just spread the tapenade right onto a French bread okay maybe some black olives I have these gorgeous cherry tomatoes and spread on the trebay and some green olives okay and then maybe some slices of French bread under the tomatoes can always find space a little of a fresh goat cheese okay and the cashews and I think we have a party only use the guests [Music] here's everybody to Paris great friends thank you so much for coming Cheers I'd like to say that I spend all day making Pat's home I spent all day at the market and some tapenade can you move some tapenade thank you cheers everyone thank you so much for Paris like it's so much fun so you know what I said about entertaining on both sides of the Atlantic I'm going to give exactly the same cocktail party at given Paris here in East Hampton including the tapenade this is a half a pound of valleys so right into the food processor and you want them drained okay next thing is three tablespoons of capers and I've drained them just right in and Jovi's I know they take like hairy fish but when they're in this they're really good so the salt and the flavor of the fish so eight anchovies pick good anchovies bad ancho this can be really bad and the next thing is garlic and of anything from Provence with that garlic I'm just going to smash it because it's really going to get pureed in the food processor okay so I'm just going to curate that up really rough just like a rough chop and I'm going to add some other ingredients some lemon about two tablespoons handy-dandy marina mer about two tablespoons you can just do it approximately two teaspoons of Dijon mustard 1/2 a cup of good olive oil essentially another ingredient that's really important for it to taste good okay now we've got to have some herbs if it's Provence all right it's a little fresh thyme just the leaves in like that and lifting some fresh parsley this is flat leaf parsley which I think there's a little more flavor than the curly parsley and for this dish would be perfect just a handful of that and that's it you don't want to puree just roughly chopped so it's a little piece of bread either toasted or plain love it same party different times and just as much fun cheers here's to East Hampton empires [Music] in Paris I take inspiration everywhere when I come to the boulevard rest by market I love to see these rotisserie chickens going around and all those gorgeous juices falling on the potatoes no fabulous and when I went home I thought wouldn't it be great to have break cubes underneath and that's how roast chicken with croutons was born it's so delicious [Music] chickens croutons work for crown or simple lunch like today when my friend Ana shows up I'm going to stuff the inside with lemon just put them right inside it's kind of really good flavor salt pepper and into the pan great so I'm gonna roast at 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes until it's just perfectly done and then I'm going to saute bread croutons and when the chicken is roasted want to slice it over the croutons so it just absorbs all that gorgeous chicken juice with flavors so for the croutons I'm going to use the sourdough bread like this you can get them all over the country but it reminds me so much of those wonderful bread can fall on bakery that I love in Paris [Music] this is Paul on it's probably the most famous bread shop in the world they're famously huge loaves of sourdough bread and they are so delicious you can buy them in lots of places the United States you could also have them shipped overnight to your door wait to see the bread ovens downstairs they can put 48 of these incredible loaves in at one time [Music] next door to Paul on they met these wonderful open-faced sandwiches called sartenes all different kinds of flavors and they're really inspiring to make their great first course a nice light lunch that looks great [Music] so one of the things we do here is we make sandwiches are like big thick roast beef sandwiches in France as we just saw they make really thin ones and you really taste the ingredients so I want to make my two favorite ones goat cheese with tomatoes and smoked salmon so I've toasted the bread a little bit and then I'm just going to spread some of them with herb goat cheese good thing about tartines is you can go through the fridge read and see what you have left over it can be brie and tomato basil whatever you want okay and then I'm going to put tomatoes on it's going to be a great first course okay under the broiler and then I'll make smoked salmon ones a few minutes that's going to be really nice and bubbly hot okay so I've got the toasted bread good smoked salmon Oh sliced in nice long slices okay next thing the sliced cucumbers just be creative about this like an herb butter on it or a little even guacamole anything like that just make it really delicious I think I'm going to do some lemon and I was like pepper on salmon so going to the black pepper and I love the way the woman who call on cut it up on a plate so I think we did something so you see how this works just like in Paris Oh perfect because great the heat sort of will through a little bit these tartines are going to be perfect starter for my dinner with Donna but right now I've to clear the decks and get ready for caramelized shallots and French string beans [Music] come on shallots they're so good and they're really easy to make 3 tablespoons of butter starting out tablespoons of sugar this is to make the caramel part and then I've got shallots that I've actually already peeled - you're feeling the way you normally feel an onion the best way is dunfin boiling water for 30 seconds and the Pips comes right off so with these cook until they get brown on all sides and if they start to caramelize so I'm going to spin 1/2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 15 to 30 minutes until they're really just tender [Music] so I've got some haricots ver and they're great on their own but I'm going to give them more flavor by doing roasted pepper
my friend Frank newbould and I are having to breakfast meetings the first one today here and the second one tomorrow with his house I've already made chunky banana bran muffins and they're cooling on the deck oven and now I'm making omelets for two I don't want to cook the omelet and bake it sets I'm going to pour out the fast no need to even wash the pan a little bit of butter okay so first the potatoes I don't even feel them and next about a half a cup of onions so let's saute them all together so when Clips potatoes and onions for about 10 minutes this until the potatoes tender now I'm going to make the online mixture 5 extra-large egg 2 tablespoons of milk 1 teaspoon salt half a teaspoon of pepper and just beat it all together a quarter cup of scallions grate right into the eggs okay the next I'm going to put it in some cheddar get some extra sharp cheddar which is really good first I'm going to grate some for the top so to create a few shreds nice long shreds like that [Music] the restaurants good dice okay four ounces of cheddar I'm going to download this is one hard anabolism okay so the next thing I'm doing just a little bit of heat I'm going to put a little bit of jalapeno pepper in not the whole thing and I want to blow it socks off and that should do so the jalapeno peppers go right into the potatoes which are perfectly cooked now it will cook for a minute going to put the bacon right back in [Music] toss it all together looks pretty good just like that okay those are done in go the eggs and the best part of this omelette is baked in the oven so I don't have to watch it on the stove 350 degrees 15 to 20 minutes oven proof saute pan then I'm going to clear up and set the table may be working breakfast but we still need flowers on the table just one big bunch of tower tulips in a nice milk pitcher so that looks great Frank's going to be here in a minute I just want to put a little bit of grated cheddar on top makes it look great tastes great never too much cheddar and put it back in the oven for a minute and two and it's going to be ready with you my breakfast is ready [Music] little omelet for you just for you potato and cheddar looks little fun thank you [Music]
food it's a very big treat this morning because the Barefoot Contessa Ina Garten is here got a brand new cookbook out today it's called cooking for Jeffrey it's filled with recipes her husband requests most often ina always great to have no hair how are you yeah after 40 what years of marriage 48 48 Jeffrey finally gets a cook buddy he death that's his food one of the secrets to a long happy marriage you know I think what it's really about is that cooking for him really is what my career was about he loves what I cook and in Kurt he encourages me and that's how I started cooking and I just love doing it wonderful after 48 years does he tell you when he doesn't love something so far he hasn't told me doesn't like anything I think it makes cooking for her but we're making filet today we're making with a wonderful sauce let's quickly look at the ingredients what jumps out this is great filet of beef mushrooms mustard big those are the important things all right yeah and shallot you can't just throw a fillet on the grill or on the stove you have to have a little technique what do you do so what I do is I take the filet beef it's tied so it keeps it an even compact little package so it cooks evenly you dry with a paper towel because you want to try and then what I do is I brush it with a little oil just like this and then I'm doing it the way steak houses do it which is what you do is you sear it and then you put it in the oven and explain why searing is so important if it keeps the juices in and it makes a nice kind of crust and then I have sea salt and black pepper that's it and just dip it in and then it goes right in the pan really the way I want to be generous with that you really that's what gives you that great crust exact and also the flavor that's exactly right so just I just do it just like that the edges I just I do the top and bottom okay and it's just fine remember the salt the sauce has a lot of flavor in it so great take this here so just about two minutes on each side and then we've got some that are seared okay I'm gonna turn this down doesn't sizzle the whole time let's take a look at this these are these are all seared and they're gonna go into the oven this is what steaks houses do put it in the oven 400 degrees for about 8 to 12 minutes having it go perfectly cook how do you do 20 degrees put a thermometer in the side okay perfect every time all right so that's gonna go in the oven pearl put it right there okay let's make our sauce when we take this the and that they made the steaks ends got all the flavor in it and now what I'm going to do is deglaze it was just fun yet by the way we've got our tasters downstairs come in down oh my god oh really and then I put in shallots so you want the sauce to have lots of flavor this is great it's not great yeah and then I put in cream and just let that simmer a little bit and it'll thicken up and then I use two kinds of mustard I use regular Dijon mustard and I use coarse mustard I love when something looks like what it tastes like so you know it's got mustard in it so just put those in and that's going to simmer away for a few minutes while the steaks are in the oven okay look at it over here and then we can we have some weight at me this is so easy yeah nice one I know camera for you and this is what the sauce is like and that's gonna go right on the steaks and then what we do is we have sauteed mushrooms which is what rooms did you say your cremini mushrooms they're really good just a little bit of butter kamini mushrooms and voila I did it all by myself this is because of the cream in the sauce this is a little bit here and of course we have ready and I want to talk about what you pair this with in a second you slice it thin or thick I like to slice it thin and actually we have some already sliced for you to taste uniformed and there's a fork here and you might need a knife no no we are cooking although these are big because I made a salad a kale salad with Caesar dressing and it's got pancetta in it it's got croutons and it's got Fabio's Parmesan cheese all right got a little bit into it oh this is about as good as it gets I guess it's I love the sauce but the filet is so guys have you don't even need it you don't it's so flavorful because it's personal pepper really makes all the difference in the world it's delish imagine ina just said you probably need a knife I cut it with the fork that's all right oh that's great mmm so weird congratulations cookbook thank you congratulation to Jeffrey as well haha she's

[Music] my friend Barbara lieth gorgeous daughter Cassandra's getting married this year and I've offered to help with a rehearsal dinner I believe in first impressions and last impressions so I've asked my friend Miguel to do two table settings for Cassandra to choose from and I'm making two over the top desserts first I'm making a Baba au Rhum which is a delicious cake made with yeast and then soaked and I mean soaked in rum syrup and second I'm giving her a choice with a o float on or floating island which is big mounds of meringue floating on a sea of vanilla creme anglaise and drizzled with caramel and pralines Cassandra's coming later to choose which table setting and which dessert she wants for her rehearsal dinner I think it's been really hard to choose so the first dessert that I'm going to suggest for Cassandra's rehearsal dinner is a classic French bistro dessert and it's called Baba au Rhum or a rum Baba and what it is is it's a yeast cake made with currants and it's allowed to rise and it's soaked I mean we're talking soaked with rum syrup and it's absolutely delicious I've been making baba Rome for Jeffrey I think since we first got married and I thought Cassandra would love it for her party okay that's really well buttered now I'm going to start making the cake so the first thing I need is warm milk you need 1/2 a cup of milk heated to 115 degrees that's the ball is really cold you want to eat a little more but if you're not sure about 115 degrees use a thermometer pull one packet of yeast in there's a little bit of a process but you can do it in advance and then soak it just before you're going to serve it one packet of yeast and two tablespoons of sugar the sugar actually makes the yeast grow it's like food for the yeast I just stir it around clean hands you can do it with your fingers let's sit for about five minutes and Lee you'll find is you'll see bubbles it's the carbon dioxide coming out of the yeast and that's how you know it's aligned alive in winter and in the meantime I'm gonna soak the currants in rum mmm that's really everything in this cake is soaked in rum so I need third of a cup of currants that's a really great they're like raisins smaller and they're little tartar so I really like them at a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar it just has much more flavor just one tablespoon and just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just gonna soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling away in the fall okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so with the mixer on low speed I'm gonna put in it first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't clump 1/2 a teaspoon of salt he always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft just gonna make a really light dough put in a little bit at the time and just like Mattoon okay perfect you can see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right now oh damn towel just a kitchen towel just slightly damp towel you don't want it soaking wet just enough so the dough doesn't dry out while it's rising okay uh I think I hear Miguel he's coming to do two table settings for Cassandra and I know that both gonna be so beautiful she'll never be able to choose oh yeah time ago thank you so much for doing this every rehearsal table needs a good stylist and you're red so I got you all kinds of things I got your flowers and I got plates and napkins and glasses I did two different claws you can change anything you like and I've learned through shapes yeah I got two shapes I thought it'd be interesting for a choice of shapes I've cooked me to do right now I understand you're doing buh buh wrong I am I'll see you there and we'll we'll get to taste - good so the guava room dough has been sitting for a bed an hour and should be doubled in volume and it is it's perfect so the next thing I want to do is drain the currents these are soaked in rum I bet that pushes might have to taste one make sure they're right mmm so good I'm just gonna pour them into the dough so this is a yeast dough and it's got currants soaked in rum throughout the dough I'm gonna let it rise one more time and then soak it so this is a really sticky down out and it's got all these currents and it's beginning to smell rum like okay they're nicely distributed and now we're gonna do is put it into the cooking off mold you can see the dough it's really nice and don't be surprised it's really wet and sticky it is like wallpaper paste it just sticks to everything I think I'm gonna new nice for this just spread it around evenly in the pan it doesn't have to be perfect so I'm gonna put a damp cloth back on it let it rise for about 50 minutes until it's about double in volume and then I'm gonna bake it at 375 for about 30 minutes gonna be great and now I'm gonna make the sugar syrup [Music] so my bobo room is out of the oven it bake for 30 minutes at 375 and I just let it cool for about 10 minutes 15 minutes until I can get it out of the pan this is the moment of truth whether in fact I've greased it enough perfect ah isn't that gorgeous I'm always amazed myself so now I'm going to do is make the rum syrup that soaks it's going to make it really good so the first thing you need is one and a half cups of water and a cup of sugar just cook this on high heat until the sugar dissolves you know I always thought that what this was originally a brioche that got stale and somebody said no let's just soak it in sugar syrup and see if it works and a little rum never hurts okay that was really fast I'm just gonna pour this into here okay and I have the 2/3 of a cup of all not just experimented a little bit usually the sugar syrup is that but I find that rum a little bit harsh and I found if I had a half a teaspoon of vanilla extra it just rounds out the flavour beautifully hmm smell that romema hot syrup and now I'm Justin very slowly pour it onto the cake so that it soaks in and you see it just absorbs all that gorgeous that's why you want the cake still to be warm when you do this and then afterwards I'm going to put a glaze on it to make it nice and shiny a little sweet and when it's serve the big mound of whipped cream in the middle mmm last bit of rum syrup into the cake see I taught it we all go in every master off okay now I'm going to make the apricot glaze so let me take pan apricot preserves on a spoon and just put about 3/4 of a cup of apricot jam into the pan about a tablespoon of water I'm just going to heat this all together and then sieve it so it makes a nice thin clear glaze okay let's just a six-second and then pour it right through the sieve okay most of my desserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion and it's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it we've got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just gonna brush it on the outside of the cake will believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake when I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose well when I wonder what table setter she's gonna choose Cassandra is not decided where she's going to have the rehearsal dinners so I'm going to give her two options a round table which is slightly more provençale more country like and this one which more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we are going to use this very nice needs of ivy we're going to create this nice little pattern in the middle that looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas so the second dessert I'm going to make for Cassandra it's called yo flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French Nursery dessert and I think she's going to just love it first thing I need to make his caramel sauce turn the heat on high really high so I've got a half a cup of water and one and a half cups of sugar and I'm going to cook it until it's a warm caramel brown color like a really rich color okay while that boils away I'm gonna start on the praline so I need one and a half cups of blanched sliced almonds you can find them in the grocery store know you can always smell this first it's just you can start to see the heat and just swirl it carefully this is incredibly hot don't touch it I'm just gonna turn it off I need a half a cup of water I'm going to add water and vanilla now this is the tricky part this is gonna bubble up violently so just stand back see what I need they need a heavy teaspoon of good vanilla extract and just stir this carefully and cook it until it's 230 degrees on a candy thermometer and it's going to be just the right consistency is going to be pourable when it's at room temperature and you can smell that wonderful caramel the sort of burnt sugar and vanilla can be delicious okay we're there 230 degrees so I'm going to take about a quarter of a cup of the caramel be really careful this unbelievably hot just drizzle it right over and the rest of the caramel sauce I'm going to save for drizzling over the ill Fatone so just mix this up together make sure the almonds are coated in caramel spread it out on the pan and I'm going to bake this 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes until the almonds are nice and brown and crisp and then I'm going to sprinkle that over the up float all and then I'm going to show you how easy the meringues are and they're just gorgeous [Music] so the next thing I'm going to make for Cassandra's ill float all is the islands or just meringue so I need eight egg whites at room temperature I'm going to say the egg yolks for making the custard right into the mixer okay I'm just going to put in a quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar that acts as a stabilizer for the egg whites and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and then turn it on high speed when it's nice and frothy I'm going to slowly add a cup of sugar advocate for the vanilla okay I'm going to do really messy mounds of this on two cheap pants lined with parchment paper good news about meringues is they're not supposed to be perfect sort of messy and organic looking this isn't like the hard meringues that you get that are like cookies these are gonna be really soft meringues melt in your mouth and because of the good vanilla they'll taste like vanilla clouds it's impossible to do this without getting it all over you and the kitchen into the oven 250 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're going to have meringues I think Miguel's starting to work on a second table setting I can't wait to see it [Music] in case that Cassandra wants something more informal I'm going to give her this second option which I'm calling it the province cell table and as you can see this is a weak color over cloth I decided to use very modern glasses for the water and stemware for the wine instead of having one centerpiece I decided to have three centerpieces I like this because it gives the idea it sort of emphasizes the idea of the round table so no matter where you look you have different flowers to look at round square I wonder which one she will choose the last part of my element is crema on glass so the first thing I need is 1 and 3/4 cups of milk and then once called it which means I'm going to heat it to just under the boiling point okay in the meantime I'm going to start making it's a very light custard so it's got egg yolks these are four egg yolks left over from making the meringues okay and then half a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cornstarch and open the milk is perfectly ready can see the bubbles around the outside and stuff before it's boiling actually it's easiest to pour it in if I poured in this and report in very slowly otherwise you end up with scrambled eggs first search isn't always used like these come-ons us but it acts as a stabilizer so it makes it easier to cook that's great okay now goes back in the pan I'm going to cook it over a very low heat until it's just slightly thickens this isn't like pastry cream which is very thick this is really a thin sauce and then after it's cooked I'm going to flavor it with amaretto and vanilla it's gonna be delicious so this is starting to thicken what it'll do is coat the spoon so a little bit more and be done perfect I'm gonna sit it just in case there are little particles and I'll know if there's anything cooked egg in it I think I just made it before it went too far look at that and I gorgeous okay one and a half teaspoons of amaretto which is almond liqueur mmm love the smell of that Khanh teaspoon of vanilla and because that's something to look like what it tastes like I think the seeds of half a vanilla pod next I'm going to assemble the El Fattah and make someone whip cream for the bubble aroma [Music] Cassandra's going to be here in a few minutes and I want to assemble the elf Lata and Baba au Rhum and time for her to get here first remember I made this wonderful creme on glass you can see the vanilla being specks in it going to make a puddle of it in the middle of this play and then meringue islands right in the middle okay a drizzle of caramel sauce I've allowed it to cool so it's nice and thick and caramel and the last part is the praline almonds that I made earlier just crack them in big shards right on top of the meringue and caramel it's like heaven and the Baba Rome nice flat green leaf it's going to be a tough choice for Cassandra I don't know what I would choose now I'm just going to fill this whole Center with whipped cream who wouldn't want to have that for dessert so these are the two desserts the first one is Baba au Rhum I took peas cake with currants that soaked in rum and of course it's filled with whipped cream okay and the second one is called a float tall which is a floating island as big meringues drizzled with caramel and then praline almonds sprinkled on the top so it's creamy on the bottom it's sort of light and fluffy in the middle and then crunchy on the top here's your test or you want to it fantastic okay Miguel you have to taste - you don't get a vote but you get a taste then only the bride gets a vote it was so much fun to make these what's they own I didn't tell you I'd make it easy for you so what do you think the decision is I think I like the floating island I do I'll do it okay but I have to tell you if you wake up at 3 and then where you go oh my god I chose the wrong one you can choose the other one yeah yeah oh I'm so glad Cheers another toaster to send an to Miguel for the tables so we have the purpose all table and then we have the urban table I think I like the Provencal yeah I have more of a hydrangea theme at my wedding and I think I love something a little dip I totally agree I think it's gorgeous tikkun yeah more desert I think we have to appeal flow Tom and Cassandra's on or right Cheers and their little tartar so I really like them and a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar it just has much more flavor just one tablespoon and just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just gonna soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling Ranma full okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so with the mixer on low speed I'm going to put in it first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't clump at the teaspoon of salt you always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft this is gonna make a really light dough put a little bit of the thyme and just let mix in okay perfect you can see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right now [Music] old damp towel and then pour it right through the sieve okay most of my deserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion and it's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it we've got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just gonna brush it on the outside of the cake will believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake oh no I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose when I wonder which table setter she's gonna choose [Music] Cassandra is not decided where she's going to have the rehearsal dinner so I'm going to give her two options a round table which is slightly more Provencal more country like and this one which more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we are going to use this very nice mix of ivy we're going to create this nice little pattern in the middle looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas so the second dessert I'm going to make sexy Sandra it's called yo flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French Nursery and add

rounds out the flavor beautifully smell that rum the hot syrup and now I'm just going very slowly pour it onto the cake so that it soaks in and you see it just absorbs all that gorgeous that's why you want the cake still to be warm when you do this and then afterwards I'm going to put a glaze on it to make it nice and shiny a little sweet I'm going to serve it with a big mound of whipped cream in the middle last bit of form syrup into the cake see I told you it would all go in every last drop okay now I'm going to make the apricot glaze so take a pan apricot preserves on a spoon and just put about 3/4 of a cup of apricot jam into the pan about a tablespoon of water I'm just going to heat this all together and then sieve it so it makes a nice thin clear glaze okay this does take six second

to have the rehearsal dinners so I'm going to give her two options a round table which is slightly more Provencal more country like and this one which is more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we are going to use this very nice mix of ivy we're going to create this nice little pattern in the middle that looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas so the second dessert I'm going to make for Cassandra it's called yo flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French Nursery dessert and I think she's going to just love it first thing I need to make is caramel sauce turn the heat on high really high so I've got 1/2 a cup of water and one and a half cups of sugar and I'm going to cook it until it's a warm caramel brown color like a really rich so we had a cup of sugar advocate for the vanilla okay I'm going to do really messy mounds of this on two sheet pans lined with parchment paper good news about meringues is they're not supposed to be perfect sort of messy and organic looking this isn't like the hard meringues that you get that are like cookies these are gonna be really soft meringues they'll melt in your mouth and because of the good vanilla will taste like vanilla clouds it's impossible to do this without getting it all over you and the kitchen into the oven 250 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're going to have meringues I think Miguel's starting to work on a second table setting I can't wait to see it [Music] in case that Cassandra wants something more informal I'm going to give her this second option which I'm calling it the provençal table and as you can see this is a weak color over clothes I decided to use very modern glasses for the water and stemware for the wine instead of having one centerpiece I decided to have three centerpieces and I don't know what I would choose now I'm just gonna fill this whole Center with whipped cream and who wouldn't want to have that for dessert so these are the two desserts the first one is Baba au Rhum it's a peas cake with currants that soaked in rum and of course it's filled with whipped cream okay and the second one is called a float on which is a floating island as big meringues drizzled with caramel and then praline almonds sprinkled on the top so it's creamy on the bottom it's sort of light and fluffy in the middle and then crunchy on the top here's your test or you want to it fantastic okay Miguel you have to taste too you don't get a vote but you get a taste that's bad only the bride gets a vote it was so much fun to make these what's they own I didn't tell you I'd make it easy for you so what do you think the decision is I think I like the floating island you do oh good okay but I have to tell you if you wake up at 3 in the morning go oh my god I chose the wrong one you can choose the other one yeah yeah oh I'm so glad Cheers another toast to Cassandra and to Miguel for the tables so we have the previs all table and then we have the urban table I think I like the Provencal yeah I have more of a hydrangea theme at my wedding and I think I love something a little different from our I totally agree I think it's gorgeous tikkun more desert I think we have that deal flow Tom and Cassandra's on or right the cheers and their little tartar so I really like them at a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar just has much more flavor just one tablespoon I'm just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just gonna soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling Ranma full okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so with the mixer on low speed I'm gonna put in me at first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't come half a teaspoon of salt you always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth as a yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft it's gonna make a really light dough put in a little bit of the time and just let me Tim okay perfect you can see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right now oh damn towel and then pour it right through the sieve okay most of my desserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion that's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just gonna brush it on the outside of the cake will believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose well when I wonder which table setter she's gonna choose Cassandra is not decided where she's going to have the rehearsal dinners so I'm going to give her two options a round table which slightly more Provencal more country like and this one which is more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we are going to use this very nice leaves of ivy I'm going to create this nice little pattern in the middle that looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas so the second dessert I'm going to make for Cassandra it's called ill flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French nursery Cassandra is not decided where she's going to have the rehearsal dinners so I'm going to give her two options a round table which is slightly more Provencal more country like and this one which more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we are going to use this very nice mix of ivy we're going to create this nice little pattern in the middle that looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas so the second dessert I'm going to make for Cassandra is called yo flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French Nursery dessert and I think she's going to just love it first thing I need to make his caramel sauce turn the heat on high really high so I've got a half a cup of water and one and a half cups of sugar and I'm going to cook it until it's a warm caramel brown color like a really rich color okay while that boils away I'm gonna start on the praline so I need one and a half cups of blanched sliced almonds you can find them in the grocery store know you can always smell this first it's just you can start to see the heat and just swirl it carefully this is incredibly hot don't touch it I'm just gonna turn it off and a half a cup of water I'm going to add water and vanilla now this is the tricky part this is gonna bubble up violently so just stand back see what I need they need 1/2 teaspoon of good vanilla extract and just stir this carefully and cook it until it's 230 degrees on a candy thermometer and it's going to be just the right consistency he's gonna be pourable when it's at room temperature and you can smell that wonderful caramel the sort of burnt sugar and vanilla can be delicious okay we're there 230 degrees so I'm going to take about a quarter of a cup of the caramel he really kept this unbelievably hot just drizzle it right over and the rest of the caramel sauce I'm going to save for drizzling over the ill Fatone so just mix this up together make sure the almonds are coated in caramel spread it out on the pan and I'm gonna bake this 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes until the almonds are nice and brown and crisp and then I'm going to sprinkle that over the oflot all and then I'm going to show you how easier than Waring's are and they're just gorgeous [Music] so the next thing I'm going to make for Cassandra's ill float all is the islands or just meringue so I need eight egg whites at room temperature I'm going to say the egg yolks for making the custard right into the mixer okay I'm just going to put in a quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar that acts as a stabilizer for the egg whites and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and then turn it on high speed when it's nice and frothy I'm going to slowly add a cup of sugar as a piece of the vanilla okay I'm going to do really messy mounds of this on two sheet pans lined with parchment paper good news about meringues is they're not supposed to be perfect sort of messy and organic looking this isn't like the hard meringues that you get that are like cookies these are gonna be real [Music] my friend Barbara lieth gorgeous daughter Cassandra's getting married this year and I've offered to help with the rehearsal dinner I believe in first impressions and last impressions so I've asked my friend Miguel to do two table settings for Cassandra to choose from and I'm making two over the top desserts first I'm making a Baba au Rhum which is a delicious cake made with yeast and then soaked and I mean soaked in rum syrup and second I'm giving her a choice with yo float aunt or floating island which is big mounds of meringue floating on a sea of vanilla creme anglaise and drizzled with caramel and pralines hmm Cassandra's coming later to choose which table setting and which dessert she wants for her rehearsal dinner I think it's really hard to choose so the first dessert that I'm going to suggest for Cassandra's rehearsal dinner is a classic French bistro dessert and it's called Baba au Rhum or a rum Baba and what it is is it's a yeast cake made with currants and it's allowed to rise and it's soaked I mean we're talking soaked with rum syrup and it's absolutely delicious I've been making bubble room for Geoffrey I think since we first got married and I thought the santur would love it for her party okay that's really well buttered now I'm going to start making the cake so the first thing I need is warm milk you need 1/2 a cup of milk heated to 115 degrees that's my ball is really cold you want to eat a little more but if you're not sure about 115 degrees use a thermometer for 1 packet of yeast in there's a little bit of a process but you can do it in advance and then soak it just before you're going to serve it so one packet of yeast and two tablespoons of sugar the sugar actually makes the yeast grow it's like food for the yeast I just stir it around and clean hands you can do with your fingers well it sit for about five minutes only you'll find is you'll see bubbles it's the carbon dioxide coming out of the knees and that's how you know it's alive alive and with it and in the meantime I'm going to soak the currants in rum mm-hmm that's really everything in this cake is soaked in rum so I need third of a cup of currants that's a really great they're like raisins smaller and they're little tartar so I really like them and a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar just has much more flavor just one tablespoon and just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just going to soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling away in the fall okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so with the mixer on low speed I'm gonna put in me at first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't clump at the teaspoon of salt you always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft this is gonna make a really light dough put in a little bit of the thyme and just let mix in okay perfect you gonna see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right now old damp towel just a kitchen towel just slightly damp towel you don't want it soaking wet just enough so the dough doesn't dry out while it's rising okay I think I hear Miguel he's coming to do two table settings for Cassandra and I know that both gonna be so beautiful she'll never be able to choose hi time ago thank you so much for doing this every rehearsal table needs a good stylist and you're it so I got you all kinds of things I got you flowers a sophomore rings they're melt in your mouth and because of the good vanilla I'll taste like vanilla clouds it's impossible to do this without getting it all over you and the kitchen into the oven 250 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're gonna have meringues I think Miguel's starting to work on a second table setting I can't wait to see it [Music] in case that Cassandra wants something more informal I'm going to give her this second option which I'm calling it the province style table and as you can see this is a weak color over cloth I decided to use very modern glasses for the water and stemware for the wine instead of having one center piece I decided to have three center pieces I like this because it gives the idea it sort of emphasizes the idea of the round table so no matter where you look you have different flowers to look at round square I wonder which one she will choose the last part of my elephant is creme on glass so the first thing I need is 1 and 3/4 cups of milk and I want to scold it which means I'm going to heat it to just under the boiling point okay in the meantime I'm gonna start making it's a very light custard so it's got egg yolks these are four egg yolks left over from making meringues okay and then 1/2 a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cornstarch and open the milk is perfectly ready you can see the bubbles around the outside and strips before it's boiling actually it's easiest to pour it in if I poured in this and the port in very slowly otherwise you end up with scrambled eggs first searches we've always used that you come-ons us but it acts as a stabilizer so it makes it easier to cook now looks great okay now goes back in the pan I'm going to cook it up a very low heat until it's just slightly thickens this isn't like pastry cream which is very thick this is really a thin sauce and then after it's cooked I'm going to flavor it with amaretto and vanilla it's gonna be delicious so this is starting to thicken what it'll do is coat the spoon so a little bit more and be done perfect I'm gonna sieve it just in case there are little particles or not know if there's anything cooked egg in it I think I just made it before it went too far look at that and I gorgeous okay why don't I have teaspoons of amaretto which is almond liqueur mmm love the small that teaspoon of vanilla and because I'll have something to look like what it tastes like I think the seeds of half a vanilla pod next I'm going to assemble that your foot tall and make someone whip cream for the bubble of Rome Cassandra's going to be here in a few minutes and we want to assemble the ill float on and Baba au Rhum and time for her to get here first remember I made this wonderful creme on glass you can see the vanilla bean specks in it going to make a puddle of it in the middle of this plate and then meringue islands right in the middle okay a drizzle of caramel sauce I've allowed it to cool so it's nice and thick and caramel and the last part is the praline almonds that I made earlier just crack them in big shards right on top of them away and caramel it's like heaven and the Baba wrong nice flat green leaf it's gonna be tough choice for this em I got plates and napkins and glasses I did two different Clause you can change anything you like and I'm glad through shapes yeah I got two shapes I thought it'd be interesting for a choice of chicks I've cooked me to do right now I understand you're doing Bubba wrong I am I'll see you and will will get to taste - what good so the Baba au Rhum dough has been sitting for a bed an hour and should be doubled in volume and it is perfect so the next thing I want to do is drain the currents these are soaked in rum fit their brushes might have to taste one make sure they're right mmm so good I'm just going to pour them into the dough so this is a yeast dough and it's got currants soaked and wrong throughout the dough I'm gonna let it rise one more time and then soak it so this is a really sticky down out and it's got all these currents and it's beginning to smell rum like okay they're nicely distributed and now we're going to do is put it into the cook of off mold you can see the dough it's really nice and don't be surprised it's really wet and sticky it is like wallpaper paste it just sticks to everything I think I'm gonna new nice with this just spread it around evenly in the pan doesn't have to be perfect so I'm going to put a damp cloth back on it let it rise for about 50 minutes until it's about double in volume and then I'm gonna bake it at 375 for about 30 minutes to be great and now I'm gonna make the sugar syrup [Music] so my bubbeh room is out of the oven and bake for 30 minutes at 375 and I just let it cool for about 10 minutes 15 minutes until I can get it out of the pan this is the moment of truth whether in fact I've greased it enough perfect ah isn't that gorgeous I'm always amazed myself so now what I'm gonna do is make the rum syrup that soaks it's going to make it really good so the first thing you need is one and a half cups of water and a cup of sugar just cook this on high heat until the sugar dissolves you know I always thought that what this was originally a brioche that got stale and somebody said let's just soak it in sugar syrup and see if it works and a little rum never hurts okay that was really fast I'm just gonna pour this into he cooked it and they have the 2/3 of a cup of oil not just experimenting a little bit usually the sugar syrup is that but I find that rum a little bit harsh and I found if I had a half a teaspoon of vanilla extra it just rounds out the flavor beautifully smell that Roma hot syrup and now I'm just being very slowly pour it onto the cake so that it soaks in and you see it just absorbs all that gorgeous that's why you want the cake still to be warm when you do this and then afterwards I'm going to put a glaze on it to make it nice and shiny a little sweet I'm going to serve it with a big mound of whipped cream in the middle last bit of rum syrup into the cake see I told you I'll go in every master huh okay now I'm going to make the apricot glaze so I'm tick pan apricot preserves - spoon and just put about 3/4 of a cup of apricot jam into the pan got a tablespoon of water I'm just going to heat this all together and then sieve it so it makes a nice thin clear glaze okay this does take 6 second and then pour it right through the sieve okay most of my desserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion and it's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it we've got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just going to brush it on the outside of the cake will believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose when I wonder which table centers she's gonna choose [Music]
[Music] my husband Jeffrey and I have been married for a really long time and tonight's our anniversary you know ever since I used to have send him boxes of brownies in college I knew that the way to his heart was with really good food so tonight I'm gonna make him one of his favorite meals maybe with a little French twist I hope he loves [Music] Jeffery's really creature of habit she likes really traditional things and even those shrimp love cocktail sauce is a fairly seventies thing I've updated it ever so slightly but it's still the shrimp for cocktail sauce but he loves so the first thing I'm going to do is flavor the water before I throw to the shrimp so 1/2 a lemon just squeeze it right into the boiling water just throw the whole lemon in it's just fine and some salt and then just put the whole shrimp in I actually cook them in the shell I think they're easier to peel and I think they say moister this is the key three minutes that's it they'll be done and if you cook them for too long they're gonna be really tough so with a shrimp and cocktail sauce I'm gonna make steak with Bernays Jeffrey's gonna be very happy and rosemary roasted potatoes I think be a great dinner we've been married for 35 years it seems like it seems like just the era - I made a big mistake once and forgetting our 20th anniversary and I'll never make that mistake again so it's three minutes and you can tell because they're really firm so you know they're done out of the water into ice water to stop the cooking okay that stops the cooking they're nice and cool so take the where these little swimmers are just peel right around they're pretty easy to do and just leave the tail on just like that now the back you want to just run your knife right down the back of it and take out that little sort of intestinal tract not pretty nobody needs to eat that and that's it perfectly cooked shrimp right into the bowl I know it's really old-fashioned but you'd be surprised how much people like it it's the first thing to go at a party whoo Jeffrey's snuck out a while ago I wonder what he's up to they better not be a blonde involved [Music] I thought of a very special gift and it it evokes actually how I'm and I got to know each other when I first met her she was in high school she used to send me shoeboxes filled with brownies like clockwork every every two weeks so I thought that it would be really great to get her a box of brownies because that would bring back the memories of when we first met [Music] they can't have shrimp with that really good cocktail sauce so I've updated it a little bit but it's really fairly traditional I'm gonna start with the other half of lemon so the next thing is ketchup good ketchup you want about a half a cup I'm nice noise as the bottle makes half a cup of chili sauce gives it lots of spice just like that okay that's gonna be really good it's a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce few dashes of Tabasco I don't like it too hot you can make as hot as you like and the last ingredients horseradish I like lots of horseradish so I'm gonna put in three tablespoons to put in as much as you like and that's it and the good news is Jeffrey's gonna think I've been working all day and only you and I along the truth mmm this looks good it should be good and spicy well that's a flavor this one is so good with the shrimp but I like to get some Browning's okay how about can you give me a small box of brownies that would be terrific that would be great it would be terrific [Music] remember the way old-fashioned shrimp used to be served it was like in a margarita glass with the cocktail sauce in the middle and the shrimp hanging over the side you know just like this I think we can be a little more modern than that so I'm just gonna take a pretty white plate silver dish put the cocktail sauce in the middle and then just a ramp to the stripper nicely around the outside kind of like with the tails out just sort of neatly don't want to look like a dog's breakfast and then maybe just for decoration since there's a lemon in it I use the women let's see you know it's pretty old fashioned dessert maybe I'll do an old-fashioned lemon decoration where you can take take your knife and just go back and forth go right through until you get to the center of the lemon look how funny that is that's great okay I can't wait for tonight that's gonna be really good so I thought rosemary roast potatoes will be great with a steak with fern Aires sauce Rosemary's really strong you don't want a lot it's gonna chop it up really fine Rosemary's really sort of a rough kind of leaf and you don't want to eat a whole leaf potatoes olive oil you don't even have to measure just drizzle it on lots of good salt they use kosher salt pepper and all this for just rosemary right on top okay just toss them with your hands spread them out in one layer and I'm gonna roast them at about 400 degrees really hot temperature for about an hour they're gonna be really crisp and brown on the outside and just delicious and tender on the inside [Music] I bought a present yes and I got to jazz it up a little bit okay if you have something you can help me wait I do I have all the time [Music] there you go that's great thanks Michael thanks just saved my life I really appreciate it okay I'll let you know how she does okay I know everybody thinks my recipes start with a pound of butter well this one doesn't it only starts with a half a pound of butter and you need butter to make good Bearnaise sauce which I'm gonna do it's a tarragon flavored butter and it's so delicious with a rib eye steak the first thing is quart of a cup of white wine the next thing is good white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar another quart of a cup save a half a cup total right into the pan and then we're gonna flavor it so the first thing I need is I have lots of chopped shallots that these are so wonderful they're sort of sweeter than onions I'm gonna add two tablespoons of chopped shallots then I'm gonna add fresh tarragon it's a very mild herb it's got an incredibly delicate flavor but very distinctive mmm it's really good and it's really important for been a sauce so I'm gonna add about a tablespoon of freshly chopped tarragon right into the mixture little bit of salt a little bit of pepper love this the smell of the wine and the vinegar and the tarragon it's wonderful so I'm just gonna let that boil froat like five minutes until it's reduced to like two tablespoons total so the next thing is butter so while the butter is melting I'm just go separates mix they want three egg yolks just separate them put the yoke right into the blender what the egg yolks room temperature kind of like making mayonnaise three egg yolks [Music] the vinegars minister is perfectly reduced and the butters hot so everything's going to go into the egg yolks so the first thing is that vinegar mixture that's so much flavor in this [Music] all the shallots and the tarragon vinegar and wet woman this is the trick you put the lid on and then take this little things off and start puree [Music] and then I'm gonna take the hot butter and just pour it slowly through the opening with the blender on and it's gonna emulsify it and it's gonna cook the egg yolks two more tablespoons of tarragon just at the last minute so it's really fresh tasting and who said French food is complicated how easy is that and it's done and I can't wait to taste it it's got lots of flavor it's a really good sauce and it'll be so delicious on the ribeye steak mmm how bad can that be that's just wonderful and the trick here is I'm gonna let it sit awhile and it's gonna solidify a little bit but just before I serve it I'm gonna put in two tablespoons of hot water and it's gonna really cream me again so it'll be ready whenever we're ready for dinner [Music] for an anniversary dinner I thought I'd make Geoffrey steak with Bernays you know when we were first married in 1968 steaks used to be these big thick things they were just so unbelievably huge and I realized that the Europeans really eat much thinner steaks and I think they have so much more flavor they're easier to cook and they're really much more elegant so I thought steak with Bearnaise sauce they should be thin steaks so I've got two ribeye steaks I'm just gonna leave a match take a little bit of the chill off and I've left Geoffrey in charge as a grill [Music] almost there béarnaise sauce is done the steaks just need to be seasoned and will be ready for the grill I'm gonna brush the sticks with oil first salt and pepper lots of good pepper okay they turn them you want to season both sides battle boil I think I smell the grill nope it's not Jeffrey on fire lighter fluid oh that stuff that guys like [Music] [Laughter] [Music] perfectly [Music] there's sometimes right under there so I thought string beans and shallots would be just great with steak and Bearnaise sauce always nice to have a green vegetable so I'm gonna do is I'm going to saute the shallots a little bit of butter and olive oil olive oil because it has a higher burning temperature and the butter because of this great flavor just heat that up okay then go the shouts I just large dice them I think it looks great when you can see them rather than missing them meanwhile I'm going to take the string beans and get them ready this is called an Erica ver and it's pretty much widely available everywhere now take off that end so that should be enough beans for Jeffrey and Vinnie okay into a big pot of boiling salted water just for like a minute just until it brings out the green color and it cooks it a little bit because I'm gonna finish the cooking and that's sauteed in the pan with the shallots that looks like about five minutes okay string beans are done shallots cook I'm gonna duck them a nice water just to stop the cooking and you can either let them sit or just put them directly into the shallots which I'm gonna do right now this really sets the green color it makes them really good no eyes [Music] lots of salt and pepper toss them all together [Music] that's great that looks like it's great flavor teens are perfectly cooked really still sort of al dente it's a great party dish because you can make the beans and the showers separately and then just saute them off at the last minute it's gonna be perfect for the two of us a shrimp with some big cocktail sauce watch me get all over my give them a minute okay put them on the plate cover them in foil and they're just gonna rest for about 15 minutes okay okay okay you're in charge I'll take great I'll leave you with the shrimp okay with the shrimp okay so I've left my Bearnaise sauce in room temperature and this is the secret and add a few tablespoons of hot water [Music] and nobody will know that I didn't make it right now [Music] he's great they're really crisp on the outside inside can you smell the spiciness to the rosemary so clear what it is not a sonnet and I'm sad so I still got one anniversary out of 36 come come with me give a surprise are we going [Music] I got a surprise I got a surprise anniversary surprise for mobilization I like that I got you a present reminds me at least of what you used to give me just when I first met and used to send you this press used to sell shares to put it in a shoebox I used to send you Brandis in college right the brownie happy anniversary the symbol and why don't we do this all the time
I first met I know Garten about ten years ago while I was shopping in the Barefoot Contessa her mouth-watering specialty food store on the eastern end of Long Island ina and I discovered that we shared many interests cooking gardening and of course entertaining and Ines recently published book the Barefoot Contessa cookbook she shares her very delicious recipes and practical and yet casual approach to entertaining and I'm so glad to finally have you here as this studio I love the book as you know I said I wrote the foreword is excellent for you've done so many different kinds of entertaining menus but this one just appealed to me so much the clambake and pot it's actually really fun to do and it's incredibly easy so kitchen clambake I'll do anything you tell me I do want you to start reason why I did a clambake in the kitchen is because after years of doing clam bakes outside when it guaranteed it's going to be the hottest day of the year the rainiest day of the interest or the success you can hear everything I guess and everything including the food I thought well why not just do it inside so that's what we're going to do today often is scrubbing the muscle okay fantastic so the first thing that I do is I put 3 cups of yellow onions in the pot well 1/4 of a cup of olive oil and 2 cups of leeks I like to just dice the white part of the leek and you know you have to get them nice and clean from the sand so that's going to saute in here into the onions and leeks are a little bit browned about 15 minutes and meanwhile what we can do is clean all the mussels don't take that little beard off yeah just make sure it's pretty way and yeah now that oh here's one more little beard yeah the little beard okay sounds like a must hold off and either pretty nice usually pretty clean when they come from the success that's red or just rinse when you drop them a little bit with a brush here's a little um nail brushing wooden nail brush which oh sorry now this what we did with it with these is we put them in water and I put some cornmeal in drink the water and the cornmeal if discord is any sand that's left so that's they've been soaking for about 30 minutes and they just rinse all the cornmeal off and that's it and these are the steamers most of these things are from the East End of Long Island where Barefoot Contessa is so it's not a knife not a kebab I love it from your favorite place already for a wiki Kara wiki and the best job on so it is ok one of the nice right great chef is already so what we do with the kielbasa is this is more than we need actually but it does not if you love cube ah so you can put more in we need about a pound and a half want to cut the Fetzer so what I do is like one inch pieces and on diagonal times yeah so good the onions and leeks are cooking really nicely now so then all we do is just layer everything one on top of the other in order to cook everything separately it all just goes in first I want to put the potato did these don't do position in potatoes but one and a half pounds of potatoes put that in on the bottom and then I put in a tablespoon of kosher salt and a half a tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper and then put the Cabasa and I like to put it right next to the potato so it slavery up so good so right on top and pound of steamer clams license perfect just stomp almond this is the easiest cousin colony it's almost like assembling rather than cooking and then we have two dozen Little Neck clams everything on top and two pounds of mussels and then one and a half pounds of large shrimp in the shell don't even have to shell them we do that at the table when we're in red and these are all rinsed but they're really just exactly as you get them from the store and I like to use two cups of white wine which is going to make the broth and then I like to use three one and a half pound lobsters if goes three turn the fire up a little bit to medium you cook for 15 minutes until you start to see steam coming out of the pot and then you turn the stove down a little bit and you let it simmer for 15 more minutes and it's done the potatoes are cooked the kielbasa is heated throw me my salt we have 30 minutes all together and it turns out perfectly every time well it looks Adams you're the clam I always find myself at the end with a flashlight looking into the pot because it's not only sandy and it's windy but it's dark so that just stays like that so while that's cooking we have the pot water ready for the corn how's the rest of the corn I like it you know the thing about salt is that if you season things as you go along I find they're perfectly well seasoned if you season them at the end you're just salty so I like to really season the water very well I put a lot of kosher salt in the water I think maybe you should do the tomato salad first I'll just finish fantastic tomato salad really to me is the essence of really good cooking it's about taking a great local ingredient and just enhancing it it's not about layering on lots of other flavors and just add kosher salt a little fresh basil and olive oil and that's it there's something about hands-on food where it's shared it's family style I love that I love to cook like that and serve like that what's been the response for the boat oh it's sad that I can be on my dream this is I Anna's first book and I'm sure the first of many books are you working on a second one already I thought it was going to be sort of daunting to think about writing a cookbook and I started thinking well write one chapter and see how it goes but as your natural confident is a perfectly natural extension of what you do on a daily basis at the store so we do a chiffonade of basil is that beautiful fresh basil people worry about basil leaves getting Brown and what we do with the store dunk it in water and then dry it really thoroughly in a salad spinner and then I take a baggie or some kind of a plastic bag put it just barely damp paper towel on the bottom and put the basil leaves in and that keeps them green for really four days yeah we're just ready to kind of great let's you so I'm going to stack all these basil leaves up in a little pile and then you roll them up really tight and the need to shift them do very thin julienne strips and then you really get the flavor of the first basil on the tomato just like that and I sleep really strongly in using whatever the flavor of what you're cooking is in the garnish rather than doing something that's different so I like to put a big bunch of fresh basil so when you look at it it looks like basil it smells like basil really over just lots of coarse salt got great kosher salt here lots of cores he's all right for default Leah and just drizzle some great olive oil on and that's it so the salads already the corn has about five more minutes okay five eight lambic is just let's go look at the David's starting to seem it's just starting yeah we can finish off the wine here this is not only the new book but the clambake I can't wait to taste and see if it sounds ready it's ready that's it yep so I'm going to turn it down now - what - low and it will just steam for another 15 minutes and it will be done [Music]
[Music] but I told my friends I was thinking about making ham for Thanksgiving they went crazy no Turkey they cried so I decided to cave in and I'm making everyone's favorite turkey with urban Apple stuffing pumpkin banana mousse tart and no [Music] so for Thanksgiving everybody asks that pumpkin pie but at my house my mother used to make a pumpkin banana mousse tart which was actually really good so I'm doing a version of that it's kind of like pumpkin pie with the volume turned up and the good news it starts with a graham cracker crust so 14 graham crackers all ground up it's about 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs third of a cup of sugar and I put a little bit of cinnamon in I just think it gives it a nice pumpkin pie spice lots of flavor big on flavor and the last thing of course is butter so it's one stick of melted butter I'm just gonna mix it all together so later I'm gonna fill this with a pumpkin mousse that's flavored with a little bit of banana which makes it wonderfully sweet and some orange zest and lots of spices it's really good into an 11 inch tart shell clean hands always a cook's best tool so just Pat it out so it's even and then I take a cup measure middle cup measure and do the edge just like that and then you know and then for the thick crust right at the edge so much easier than traditional pie crust so into the oven 350 degrees for about 10 minutes until it's just a little firmer than it is now now we get to make the good part the pumpkin banana mousse filling so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of half-and-half and I'm gonna put it into a double boiler I know every starter set of pots comes with a double boiler which is two pots one on top of the other but you can really make your own double boiler by putting a heatproof bowl directly over a pot and then you can have all different sizes and the next thing is one 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree I've done this with cooking a pumpkin and puree it or a can of pumpkin puree and believe me you can't tell the difference and I can tell you which one's easier okay so that's in next ingredient is one cup of brown sugar and you want this sort of lightly packed it's how brown sugar is generally measured right into the pumpkin and then some good spices 3/4 of teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg big wooden spoon and just stir it around so I'm gonna cook this for about five minutes until it just gets warm and then I'm gonna add egg yolks to it to make a custard but I think the tart shell is ready to come out of the oven [Music] perfect it's just a little Brown around the edges I'm just gonna cool and get firm so now I'm gonna make the custard so I've got two egg yolks and what I want to do is I want to warm up the egg yolks a little bit with a pumpkin mixture so and I'll end up with scrambled eggs just like making a traditional custard and then pour the whole thing back into the hot pumpkin mixture see when ice scraper I just want to get all of it and just mix that up and just cook that for about four or five minutes so it's gonna go into that tart shell it's gonna cool overnight if you want to you can make it the day before and then I'm gonna decorate it with whipped cream so it's not only delicious but it's really gorgeous so let's take one package of gelatin and just soften in a quarter of a cup of cold water when it's chilled the egg yolks are gonna help the mousse to set but the gelatin is gonna help it - okay off the heat I'm just gonna add these other ingredients mashed bananas the softened gelatin and the last thing is orange zest okay I'm just gonna stir this up so while that cools I'm gonna whip the cream you need about 1/2 a cup of heavy cream and then I'm gonna use more for decoration later but and 2 tablespoons of sugar okay that should do it didn't do this with a hand mixer if you want to also okay that's perfect with whipped cream you want to make sure that it's really firm like that that it stands up but if you get it too far you end up with butter don't want that okay I'm gonna fold this into the pumpkin mixture so put the whipped cream right in the middle and then the spatula I use a rubber spatula just go straight down through the middle and then fold it over that way straight down through the middle and then right to the bottom of the bowl and then fold it over just keep doing that until it's really more mixed she's looking gorgeous perfect right into the graham cracker crust it smells great and the good news about this is you can make it in advance leave in the fridge for a day and then decorate it just before you're going to serve doesn't look at bad doesn't so I pulled on my friends to find out what their favorite thing for Thanksgiving is but the truth is I can't have Thanksgiving without this cranberry fruit can serve so I'm going to add a cup of water and one in 3/4 cups of sugar so I'm gonna cook this together for about 5 minutes until the cranberries sort of pop open when it gets really hot the skins burst open and then you get all of the cranberry fruit in this conserve the next thing I'm gonna put it in is apple and actually granny smith apples are great because the green apples have a lot of pectin in it and it's the pectin that's gonna make the cranberry fruit conserve set so you want to pick a really tart apple the tart of the Apple the more pectin it has I'm just gonna peel this little guy and then just chop it up you wanted to sort of disappear when it cooks into the she serve so I'm gonna chop it up fine this Apple is nicely chopped up it's gonna go into a bowl and then I'm gonna have the zest of an orange and the zest of a lemon and the fruit also I can hear the cranberries popping okay one orange and the zest of a lemon I just think this really takes away from the sweetness of the fruit conserve okay that's the zest I'm just gonna check and see how the cranberries are doing and I'd say they're popping okay that's gonna cook for another few minutes while I juice the fruit okay so the juice of one arms and the juice of a lemon okay so all this is gonna go in the apples and the orange zest and lemon zest and then I'm gonna cook them all together for about 15 minutes and you'll see that Apple just sort of melts into the cranberry fruit conserve and the pectin in the apple is gonna make the whole thing jail just it's magic great so while that's cooking we're gonna start the urban Apple stuffing it's a really good stuffing for the turkey it's very traditional it's got much more modern zing to it and now I just need to get some other ingredients four cups of onions two cups of chopped celery always get them in advance the next thing is to chopped apples into the sauté pan with the celery and okay so that's gonna cook on sort of medium-low heat so I'm gonna have it about two tablespoons of fresh parsley it doesn't have to be perfectly minced just serve wrap and then I'm gonna do but I'm gonna have teaspoons of fresh rosemary and we just need salt and pepper the onions have just start to brown and I think it really pleased had all the flavor of vegetables for the meantime let me finish the cranberry sauce [Music] so with traditionalists I'm gonna leave it plain and for people like me that want a little more flavor I'm gonna add walnuts and raisins so these are two dishes I want to serve them in and I can just chill them right in the dish so that's the cranberry fruit concern now everybody wants Thanksgiving exactly the way they remember when they were kids so I really try and do it for each person the way they remember it and Steven doesn't like nuts so I want to make sure yes exactly what he wants so I'm just gonna add raisins and chopped walnuts to the rest just mix them in and it's got great flavor and texture so we've got cranberry fruit conserved for the traditionalists and the wild and crazy ones so I have bread cubes that I've toasted sourdough bread which I like and I toasted them just so they get some of the moisture out and then it'll really absorb the flavors of the turkey and stock and everything else so I'm just gonna take all the vegetables I just cooked and pour it right over I'm gonna add about a cup of chicken stock it smells the cooked apples and celery and toss it all together and that's ready to go inside a big bird this year I tried suggesting to my friends that would make a big Virginia ham for Thanksgiving and they went nuts they said we have to have turkey so we're having Turkey so I've got a really good fresh 12 pound turkey and I'm gonna stuff it and trust it and it's so easy won't believe it no when I was young my mother used to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to make turkey I think I had this feeling they had to cook for like 15 hours but the truth is Turkey really only used about two and a half hours to cook and it'll be really moist and delicious so I'm just gonna stuff the cavity full but not really packed you want the heat to be able to get around so it can cook properly okay that looks good so I'm just gonna tie it's a little legs together and then tie around the tail so that's not flapping around just cut it off and the only other thing to do is just take the wing tips just like doing a chicken just tuck them right underneath the body so it keeps them from flapping around okay and then the last thing is I'm just gonna brush it with butter salt and pepper [Music] so this turkey I'm gonna roast at 350 degrees for about two and a half hours and stirring noise and delicious now comes the fun part decorating the pumpkin banana mousse tart it's out in the refrigerator until it just sat and then I'm gonna decorate it with whipped cream that's pretty good so far so I need a cup of heavy cream quarter of a cup of sugar and a splash of vanilla when I say a splash of an element a quarter a half a teaspoon I'm just gonna whip it until it's firm [Music] that looks good I want it really nice and firm but not turned into butter and that's about right great [Music] so the easiest way to decorate this and it's perfectly great is to do whipped cream around the middle leaving a little border of pumpkin sort of like meringue on the top but I love to pipe it so I'll show you how to do that so take a pastry bag with a big star tip on it I think that's the nicest one and the easiest you know piping looks really mysterious but the way I learned how to do it is I just spent a day piping buttercream or whipped cream just practice and you'll get it I'm the best way to practice it's just on a board or on the marble so because you can keep using it over and over again so I'll show you if you wanted to do a shell pattern which is what I like to do just a little bit like that just like that and it's really about the pressure in the bag and really getting a feel for it it's not that hard if you want to do something even simpler it's just stars but I think for this one I'm gonna do the shell pattern so just all the way around just do like a ripping pattern and the good news is if you make a mistake you can just scoop it back into the bag and do it again how hard is that okay then maybe swirl in the middle great and then because I like the decoration to be the flavors that are in the tart I thought it'd be really nice to decorate it with a little bit of orange maybe some orange zest the traditional thing that I use for orange zest is this zester but you see it ends up very fine and I think I have a better way to decorate see it's really too fine but then the other zester is this little wonderful tool that just has little sharp edges and I'll show you what it does with the orange it has long strips of zest and I think that would be really pretty to decorate the tart with and then just take it and put it around the edge just slightly so now somebody knows it's pumpkin and orange and cream and delicious and it's ready for dessert I'm so we keep in the refrigerator until we're ready to serve it I think that's not bad have to say carving is not something that generally do with company around because I can make a real mess just put up a leg nice big leg for somebody that likes that what I do is I let the turkey sit for about 20 minutes and if all the juices get right back into the turkey it really makes it flavorful and moist and the trick of the white meat is instead of slicing it the way it's traditionally done I'm going to run my knife where I mean cut off the entire breast in one piece and then slice it it's exactly what I like to do a chicken and then just slice it right across I think it's so much easier than wrestling with it this looks really sudden one side and I would say that looks like Thanksgiving and I have parmesan smashed potatoes every family has their favorite recipe so this is mine and I keep it warm on the top of the double boiler and then Frank wanted Brussels sprouts and roasted Brussels sprouts I rest them a really high temperature with olive oil salt and pepper couldn't be easier and that's what Frank wanted for Thanksgiving and plain cranberry fruit conserve and cranberry food conserved with raisins and nuts come everybody help yourself this so wonderful and I read do you have enough cranberry sauce Parsa a little sour cream here's to the absent [Music] my experience is nobody remembers what they have for dinner but they always remember dessert all right who wants pumpkin banana mousse tart I know Nyree needs a casement there's everybody cool so it turns out you know how to cook sometimes I even surprise myself Happy Thanksgiving [Music]
[Music] isn't choosing holiday gifts the worst friends of mine believe that all present should be things that disappear gather have to be used or consumed in one sitting like theater tickets or food I've decided to surprise my friends Joanne new bald and Maureen Mullin we call him Joe and Moe by leaving all kinds of wonderful edible gifts under their tree first a welcome home cup of steaming white hot chocolate with a shot of Grand Marnier then cranberry harvest muffins that are packed with dried fruit and spices and big bags of delicious homemade cherry almond and cinnamon granola and I've packed the basket with more treats than they can imagine but that's not all I've asked my friends Michael Grimm and TR pest got to sneak in during the day and decorate their house for the holidays I hope Joey and my lovin something about the holidays that calls for really special treats and I think of truffles chocolate truffles as one of those and you won't believe how easy it is then take a half a cup of heavy cream and just heat it up what you don't want to do is boil this because there's nothing worse than the taste of boiled cream okay can't make chocolate truffles without lots of chocolate I'm using bittersweet and semi-sweet I think bit up sweets a little too bitter and semi-sweet a little too sweet so I like to combine the two and get it sort of halfway in between so that's three net bounces of semi-sweet chocolate chop it up fairly fine because what I'm gonna do is pour the hot cream over it and I'm gonna melt the chocolate this is surprisingly easy candies America and I'm gonna chop up three new fences of bittersweet you know true chocolate aficionados only like bittersweet chocolate but I have to say a little bitter for me so the key to this is to add flavorings that really complement the chocolate I find vanilla and coffee really make chocolate taste more chocolaty and then I like to add one other flavor so there's sort of a back note to it very often I use Grand Marnier but this time I think I'm gonna do it with hazelnuts so I'm gonna do chopped hazelnuts on the outside and Frangelico with which is hazelnut liqueur on the inside so the next thing I'm gonna do is pour this warm cream it's actually hot it's just under the simmering point through a strainer onto the chocolate and the cream is gonna melt the chocolate you want to do it through a strainer because there's always a little bit of sort of a skin of milk it's not pretty in chocolate and just stir this a good thing about the system is you can't overheat the chocolate the cream just gets under the simmering point and it'll just melt the chocolate so we'll let that melt and add the other flavorings so the first thing is why don't ask tablespoons a Frangelica will occur which is a hazelnut liqueur but any kind of a nut liqueur be really wonderful with this one tablespoon of coffee prepared coffee which I have from this morning and if it's hot it's even better helps melt the chocolate and half a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and if I fold my cards right the chocolate should be melted by now so just stir it around if for any reason the chocolate doesn't melt you can always put it over simmering pan of water for a minute but I think it should be good I can't wait to go to Joey and Moe's to put these treats under the tree but I understand that there are some elves they're already putting things together can't wait to see it [Music] chocolates all melted it's nice and smooth and I bet it's pretty good so good I love the balance of bittersweet and semi-sweet and you can really taste the Frangelico so I'm gonna chill to serve at 45 minutes and then make little balls and roll them in hazelnuts they're gonna be great as a surprise [Music] should we unwrap it yeah and then then we can see if it's you know even holy Wow yeah right right okay I'm gonna get started at the table and I'm gonna do my favorite decorating so Michael bouncing off of your gold silver and red theme and I'm doing silver and white and so it's time to scoop the truffles so what I've got is a chilled mixture of semi-sweet chocolate bittersweet chocolate and all kinds of delicious flavorings like hazelnut liqueur Frangelico vanilla coffee and cream they've been chilling in the refrigerator you can scoop this with spoons the old-fashioned light but a small ice cream scoop makes it really lovely it's easy and you get every single ball exactly the same and I'm gonna roll each one and chopped hazelnuts that I've toasted in an oven for about 10 minutes at 325 now that looks good enough to eat I think Joey no we're gonna love these remember you don't want perfect little circles you want them to look like wild truffles that's great for the holidays just pack them up in a bag and it's a great hostess gift okay last one no and the hazelnuts so these are perfectly delicious at room temperature on a plate but since I'm gonna pack them in a bag from Joey and Moe I'm gonna chill them for a little bit until they get nice and firm so they can pile up beautifully I think they're gonna be very happy at Christmas morning [Music] next I think I'm gonna make cranberry harvest muffins and maybe a cherry almond cinnamon granola that's gonna be good [Music] cranberries are one of the classic holiday foods because they're only in season from Thanksgiving to Christmas this recipe for muffins comes from one of my favorite cookbooks open house cookbook by Sarah Chase Sarah you said this wonderful specialty food store in Nantucket called que sera sera and of course that's where cranberries are going so the first thing one do is chop cranberries not easy to do they roll around on the board like mad just like that really coarse and then we also have figs so these are dried figs just take off that little stem and then just dice those these muffins are really easy to make all you do is combine the dry ingredients the wet ingredients and all these good chunky ingredients okay now to make the muffins so I've got three cups of all-purpose flour just lighten it with your cup it's make lots of muffins and then tablespoon of baking powder baking powders always double-acting the first time it starts going is when it gets wet and the second time is when it hits the heat in the oven and I need 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt a lots of spices tablespoon good cinnamon ground cinnamon mmm that's the most very holiday ish and 2 teaspoons of ground ginger which is a great flavor okay so sift these together and then actually combines them they make sure there are no little particles in the flour and there aren't perfect so there's the dry ingredients just combine the flour and the cinnamon and ginger it smells great just make it well right in the middle now we need one and a quarter cups of milk just gonna make about 18-month ins ran the milk 2 eggs I use actual extra-large eggs just needs a little bit right in the middle and two sticks of melted butter and then just stir all this together until it's just combined don't over mix it you'll end up with tough muffins with it okay next thing is the cranberries all the chopped cranberries and chopped figs and then two kinds of sugar 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar that gives it a really sort of caramel flavor very holidays 3/4 of a cup of white sugar no the cranberries are really tart so needs a lot of sugar and then just stir it all together Joey just finished renovating her house she designed it herself can't wait to see how they're decorating it so many tips for decorating a tree just does a great job thank you I like to use white light green cords of course that blend in with the tree then I'd like to do a mixture of different sizes and shapes and I also like to take ornaments and put them deep into the tree because it's just to give it that fullness and I actually like to use great florist wires to hang the ornament because you can cut them at every different lengths that's such a great idea like because it gives you the illusion that they're just floating that's great it really does okay would you change too much so I'm just scooping cranberry harvest muffins into the pans I'm just gonna bake them awesome to be nice and fresh Joanna mo okay and you know my pickups make that 18 muffins these cups are great you can just buy them anywhere I particularly like the plain white ones [Music] is battered fabulous you can actually store it in the refrigerator [Music] I'm gonna bake these 375 for about 20 to 25 minutes until they're nice and puff would be really sweet and tart and perfect for holiday breakfast [Music] and next I'm gonna make wonderful granola with dried cherries almonds and cinnamon something to the next treat I want to make for a good holiday breakfast is granola you can make it all different kinds of flavors but I'm gonna make granola with coconut cherry almond and lots of cinnamon so I'm gonna start with 4 cups of old-fashioned oats you don't want quick-cooking 2 cups of sliced almonds they're blanched sliced ons and 1 cup of coconut it's sweetened shredded coconut this is great cuz it you can eat it right away but it also sits in the pantry really well and then for this one I'm gonna use dried cherries they're really good they're sweet and they're tart and they'd be great in this we need 1 and 1/2 cups just really roughly chopped just so they get distributed and for Nolan okay one and a half cups of dried cherries right into the granola it's a big batch what's the next thing is vegetable oil I need 1/2 a cup let's put right on top and 1/3 of a cup of honey and this is the secret to honey if you put the vegetable oil in the container first the honey I'll just pour right out look at that instead of sticking to the container perfect I know lots of really good Grand Central huh that doesn't smell like the holidays I don't know what does two teaspoons of ground cinnamon you don't want the stuff that's been sitting in your spice drawer for 10 years we want it to be really fresh okay just mix it all together and then I'm gonna bake it for a bit 20 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees you know it's just fabulous to have around the house because it's good Krauser it over ice cream or for a little snack with yogurt but for breakfast it's perfect [Music] they just spread it around that's gonna bake at 350 for about 20 to 30 minutes I'm gonna toss it in the middle make sure it Browns evenly until it's really crisp and golden and that's gonna be good for holiday breakfast very harassed muffins smell like they're done [Music] if it comes out clean they're done go put them on the top let them go [Music] gorgeous [Music] Oh fantastic [Music] I've got a little bit more green to put on the table and then I think we are finished so I thought the minute Joey and Moe walk in the door wouldn't it be nice to have a big steaming cup of hot chocolate I'm gonna do it with a twist I'm gonna do hot white chocolate with a little Grand Marnier it is the holidays after all so I pour in hot cups of milk 4 cups of half-and-half I'm gonna heat that up slowly you don't want it to get boiling and then I'm gonna chop up 1 pound of white chocolate this is really good white chocolate no like chocolate bars don't use chocolate chips they have stabilizers in them and won't B's luxuriously smooth I actually tried all different kinds of liqueurs in this thinking what would be the best I tried Frangelica which is hazelnut I tried a coffee liqueur but I really think Grand Marnier is the best complement to the white chocolate sort of vanilla and orange together okay that's all chopped up oh this is perfect you want the milk and the cream to be simmering which is little bubbles around the outside okay in goes all this gorgeous chocolate I think there's enough chocolate here I can smell the vanilla the chocolate and just stir it until it melts okay I have to add a few more flavors to this and then I'm going to pack everything up in a big basket and take it over for a great surprise for Joey and Moe I can't wait well it's gorgeous perfectly melted I'm gonna add some great flavor first thing is vanilla bean I'm just gonna take two vanilla beans and slice them up and these are really expensive but it's the holiday so it should be fabulous try and do it without cutting myself these are the seeds just because the holiday I'm going to do two of them I use it for vanilla custards anything that you wanted to have really intense vanilla flavor and also when you want it to look like vanilla that's how it's gonna do I'm gonna add two teaspoons of good vanilla extract this is not the place for artificial in anything and maybe a quarter to a third of a cup of Grand Marnier orange liqueur and the vanilla so good together [Music] okay that's nice and frothy and light I'm just gonna keep it warm and then I'm gonna put a thermos to bring over to their house in the meantime I'm having a big basket with all kinds of holiday goodies chocolate truffles with hazelnuts [Music] should let them all here [Music] cranberry harvest muffins cherry cinnamon granola the champagne is always a good gift little scheme might be nice and it's wintery white hot chocolate find that under their tree I just need to work these ribbons in a little more and I know it's a it looks bad Oh [Applause] [Music] tearing your timber looks so beautiful they're gonna be thrilled and this trees amazed that you're good what is that tree of lights on it it does feel a bit yeah I have hot chocolate for though I wanna make sure they drink it the minute they come in this is delicious make sure they drink that [Music] Oh I do love a surprise drink me let's start there I think was terrific teamwork this has got to be the work of ina cheers to the holiday that was great
[Music] since we're having a barefoot reunion I thought I'd do all classic recipes and coleslaw is definitely one of those I thought I'd updated a little bit with blue cheese I'll show you how easy it is in a food processor just take the slicing blade on time put the cabbage in sideways so you get long shreds otherwise you get short one how easy is that just keep putting more cabbage on the top and slicing you can't put it in sideways that's half a white or green cabbage pour that into a large ball and now for the red cabbage then the red cabbage goes right on top don't mix them in otherwise the red cabbage in like the white cabbage red just put right on top last thing is Kara I'm going to grate them with a grating disc top that you don't use this very often but when you do it's really useful if it's going too much credit and one that would take by hand and just put that right on top now all the vegetables are ready and make a sauce so the sauce is like 16 ounces of mayonnaise this makes a lot great recipe for a crowd semester we're have quarter of a cup of Dijon mustard two tablespoons of whole grain mustard two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar [Music] absolute celery salt it gives it great flavor as it tastes bit of salt a teaspoon of pepper and whisk that together just for this whole thing not enough salt wasn't it but not so much this wet and sloppy okay now I'm going to add blue cheese and parsley I like rogues are for this got a really sharp flavor I'll just cut off the end the edge and then just chop it up and mix it in put it in I know there are those of you to think the chef smells like gym socks but it's really delicious and okay mix that in and the flavors are really blend as they sit ok blessing is parsley just toss the parsley in mix it in you [Music]
[Music] entertaining from the Israeli by gathering my friends together and making a delicious food that's really nurturing I don't think there's anything more nurturing than a big pot of cheddar corn chowder bubbling away on the stove I always think Saturday night is the hardest night to entertain I just think it's the most daunting meal you have to make three courses it's a big deal people stay past my bedtime so I love to entertain on Sunday for lunch it's just a wonderful time so I'm going to make shedder corn chowder it's a very simple meal with a salad and some cheese and wonderful little dessert and everybody has a great time and by 3 o'clock they're off on their way and it's a wonderful day so for cheddar corn chowder I've got some vacation cooking a little bit of olive oil I never knew any soup this tougher from a little bit of bacon and this bacon is going to go into the soup later and it can be a garnish so to be really good I'm going to put in about 6 cups of onions - laughs it's going to make a lot of soup when you're cooking with onions I always use Spanish onions which are these big onions but you can also use some small regular yellow onions I just make a bigger one through easy to cut up some has to fit on a medium high flame for 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and they have lots of flavor so while the onions are cooking I'm going to cut up the potatoes I don't even peel them first of all days here I also like the way it looks it just looks really earthy and real these are actually Yukon Gold potatoes but you can use any kind of coil impetus I just love that sort of buttery color and flavor of the Yukon Gold so these kids gorgeous they're really in the fall it's wonderful to use things with freshly dug and we're really firm so my onions are good now they're really translucent and you smell them everywhere so good ok then I'm going to add 1/2 a cup of flour this is just going to take a list it a little bit and we're going to cook it to make sure the flour doesn't only sort of raw flour tape and a little bit of turmeric turmeric to spice that's using curry powder and it's just going to be give a little intensity to this and of course turning yellow which is gorgeous and salt and pepper that's the time I'd like to add the seasonings which I think it really gets into the flavor of the soup and it's spring the heat really brings out the turmeric and the salt and pepper yet it later just tastes salty wonderful okay and then my potatoes that's six cups of diced potatoes and twelve cups of chicken stock I have homemade chicken stock cuz I love it but you can really use a good canned chicken stock if you if you don't have time to make it if you thought you had to sacrifice from the fridge if you have it in the freezer just a frosted the night before so now I'm just going to bring it up to a simmer and cook it for about 15 minutes and then the potatoes are going to be done and then I'm going to add all this gorgeous corn that I got from pikes oh and after the corns gone in I'm going to finish it off with a little bit of cream and cheddar cheese mmm [Music] [Music] hi Amy hi ru and you're gonna help me I'm getting special treatment yeah thank you I need some shelter for my children chatter okay I have a look we're not havin chatter yeah how would that be okay it's a really sharp cheddar it'll be wonderful with a chowder he's like that perfect as much as I need a little left over for the show Hey we hope you with some bread to go with the name fabulous all right let's see I want everything I don't think all these cookies no what I really need is a bread for my soup okay I think what are here maybe one of the bed guests that you make sure I love those and it may be one of the Eli seven-grain bread and then I'll restrain myself from the is this S&amp;M [Music] I think with lunch you don't want to send people home really full you know like holding their bellies so I thought coconut macaroons would be wonderful for dessert so I've got 14 ounces of coconut it's really the wonderful big balls of coconut it's sweetened grated coconut ly buy in the grocery store it's 2 7 ounce packages I'm going to add 1 can of sweetened condensed milk not going to believe how easy these are to make or have fast they disappear about a teaspoon of vanilla good vanilla and just fold these together I just love these so it's full rich coconut flavor of these and help you do there or to make it and just whip them up okay and then the last ingredient is beaten egg whites two eggs plainly two egg whites room temperature because otherwise though it won't whip very well and I want to show you how I beat it pinch of salt keeps them from going flat flip it on high-speed so I think that's it but this is what you want to look for is that the egg whites stand up and they're still soft it's not really hard and then we're just going to fold it into the coconut mixture and that's a whole batter so I'm just going to fold them and carefully so don't deflate the eggs that's it that's the batter show you how to bake them I actually use an ice cream scoops and just nice big full scoops of macaroons see this Lake coconut is going to get really brown on the outside but if you don't have a scoop like this you know what just do it with two spoons and the comment just is beautiful I'm going to serve two dips for lunch my favorite pan fried onion dip and sun-dried tomato dip it's big pot of cheddar corn chowder and nice salad and macaroons for desserts me so good so these go in the oven at 325 for about 25 to 30 minutes until they're nicely browned and the coconuts toasted that's going to be good so I've got the cheddar corn chowder on the stove for my scoop lunch and macaroons in the oven I'm just going to make a little sun-dried tomato dip with my guests arrived so let's say you've got a quarter of a cup of sun-dried tomatoes which you see how easy this is half a cup of mayonnaise half a cup of sour cream my friends Antonia and Donna and their daughter and Antonia's daughter Tess are coming they're going to love this set ten dashes of Tabasco salt and pepper - and pepper it happens of room-temperature cream cheese this is like that old fashioned flavor of Thousand Island dressing bit asleep on the disk and the sun-dried tomatoes got so much more flavor and one last ingredient is scallions so they are just going to chop up two scallions just give it a little fresh flavor and some heat I'm going to make a good dip it's really about the texture and the flavor I just think it's so important but if you close your eyes you know exactly what you're reading that's the test this doesn't have to be so perfectly chopped that's going into the food processor these were cute scallions I'm not going to use the whole thing is is that looks so good it's the right color to all tomato is so you know what it is before you tasted tomato and a little scallion so people know what's in it as a garnish [Music] and I think I smell the macaroons they must be done hot coconut macaroons that's the best one of the fun things to do when I'm surprising people is when I have a very earthly meal like a soup once which I'm going to have to do risk fancy cutlery and wonderful China and really drag out the good stuff now what I'm doing is setting I always do the flowers first because I'll go out to the garden or go to the florist see what's really nice and then design the table setting around that so they all match and just take my inspiration from this so this is the kind of lunch where it's really fun I just set the table and everything for lunch and set up in my kitchen the soup is in a pot on the show make it feel like family no you can just go into the kitchen and help yourself [Music] what I have here is two large onions that I've cooked for about 25 minutes so you get all the sweetness of those wonderful onions and then I'm gonna make a dip out of it I'm going to pour these into the food processor and the add salt and pepper and for some heat a little pinch of cayenne pepper 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise 1/2 a cup of sour cream out of that 4 ounces of cream cheese so I've got all this gorgeous caramelized onions and all the flavorings in here and I'm just going to pulse it until it's all mixed together now I can smell all that delicious sweet onion how easy is that just taste it make sure it's okay I'm so good it's got that wonderful caramelized sweet onion flavor and just so everybody will know exactly what it is I need to the last few onions from the pan on the class so that's done I'll put it in the fridge until lunch is ready and I think I'll make my cheese board next [Music] my soup lunch a nice cheese and salad course is going to add real substance or a simple meal the first one is I try to have an assortment of cheeses I have three of them here one six sharp a treeless cheddar one that's creamy it's a really spicy Taleggio it's got a creamy texture to it and the third one I like to have a blue cheese so I've gotten a really nice organ Zola so the thing about G is you really want to buy in advance and when you go to the store ask for case that she's still really expected to taste things and it's the only way to know what you like try new cheeses maybe a sheep's milk cheese and something you've never had and it can be really a great experience and your guests will get to taste different things too and I'm going to serve it with wonderful fruit I these gorgeous long-stemmed strawberries it's delicious and these little champagne grapes which are wonderful any kind of grapes will be good I find green leaves make the cheese look gorgeous and the fruit so you can either go to the florist and ask them for lemon leaves or I have some hydrangeas outside so I'm going to go get some lead [Music] big slide hydrangea leaves for my cheese board the key is that you want to flatly that the cheese will just sit very simply on so let's try a nice big one right there you'll see what a difference it makes and one more gorgeous big one okay the key to arranging any platter is that there's something for your eye to focus on in the middle so I'm going to put the cheese's on three cheese's facing out so it's easy for people to help themselves and the Taleggio so you'll see the first thing is the strawberries and because of the stems that's going to be my thing that's tall and long some strawberries are gorgeous but it can be a huge bunch of grapes with a stem that comes up it can be really anything you have some height to it so that's something that's tall that's like deep sky and then the cheese's are like the earth is something solid in the middle and then I'm going to take these little champagne grapes aren't they wonderful and have them flowing forward like the water it gives it balance without symmetry which is really a lovely thing so now I'm going to do all of the things in one place so it has some simplicity it's not like a big bowl of M&amp;Ms all different colors everywhere it's just something about the sweetness of the fig it's nice to see the inside of that gorgeous fig and the next thing is the apricots and when you do it on this side these gorgeous orange apricots now the colors and the flavors and the texture is just absolutely wonderful I'm going to put a knife right in here and I'm going to let it sit at room temperature for a while that's it [Music] the next is the green towel to go with all those gorgeous cheese's first thing is there's so many different kinds of lettuce to choose from and I just think it's really worth finding some delicious lettuces into the venture a big head of white lettuce that we're used to seeing so vinaigrette don't be afraid of it I don't know why people find it daunting it's really just an emulsion of vinegar and oil and a little bit of flavoring to make it taste great so the first thing is vinegar that's three tablespoons a good vinegar and then a little bit of garlic maybe a half a teaspoon of chopped garlic the next things mustard good Dijon mustard is really important and you can use whole grain mustard or smooth mustard about a half a teaspoon of mustard and then salt and pepper so parts easy isn't so I have a teaspoon of pepper and the last thing I'm going to use for a binder for an emulsion it's an egg yolk but frankly if you don't want to use a raw egg yolk and you can regret just leave it out the mustards going to mull safai it a little bit anyway so one raw egg yolk the whip things together and then I'm going to slowly add in oil better half a cup of olive oil I'm going to pour it in the verge close cream right there it's sort of like making mayonnaise but much good okay that was good and I'm Megan vinaigrette so I'm just going to take a nice source of lettuce because the only way to really test a vinaigrette is on the leaf you really find out that it doesn't overpower the flavor of the lettuce but it really enhances it I'm delicious just the right balance of vinegar olive oil and I do love the garlic it's wonderful so I'm just going to take this bowl I'm going to start tossing my lettuce on top of it and let it sit just tear them off after the rough it is the better so that's the la la raza lettuce lovely red leaf lettuce it's wonderful mescaline next which is all different kinds of leaves together and the last thing I want to put on this is miss soon which is sort of a spicy but really tender leaf all the clips to do is with the cheddar and the corn and the cheddar corn chowder and get ready for my guests [Music] so basically transfer time into sun-dried tomatoes ready oh good fabulous I did for Sandra's manager from Stanford on in depth do you do that when you do the onions you do them in butter or olive oil away bit in a little of each so I know what for that well I made a big pot of cheddar corn chowder and Excel and Jesus and because I thought tests would like it macaroons for dessert okay you guys want to send you out so I can finish making this guy working we don't have any fun without me okay I'll be right there okay I'll do it finish this to open everything's ready so remember the corn I've shut it and filled it and I'll show you how I do it's really easy take the husk off and then cut off the end like this suggest a nice little rear around like that and then just cut the chrome up right off the corner most of them go flying all over the kitchen wreck trying to get most on into the soup okay so it's about ten cup of corn kernels and I'm just going to put them in boiling salted water for a few minutes to blanch them just to get some of the starchiness ass and it cooks it so it goes into the last minute two cups of half-and-half into the soup I should do it and the cheddar cheese and just let that melt so that's a good cheddar that I bought that Vermont cheddar that I bought at the store about half a pound and it's just thickens the soup and gives a great flavor just drain this corn you know facial at the same time and it goes right into soup and it's done then a little bacon that we cooked earlier right into the soup okay soup's on so it's like a gentle light now you take a play this note guys oh okay he's got a cheddar corn chowder it is also going to write those what are you doing outside peel it off the because the corn first go to corn just blanch it quickly and put it in as a last minute how's that take a roll and I'll meet you in there okay I'll be right there so everyone enjoy your soup is it was going on this Johnson I would so crunchy go go oh of course really so fresh oh thank you so a little salad juice alone babylegs yummy your cheese is this really good Swiss cheddar run six weeks look at the check whoa runaway fig are they family I know anyone want mica rune perfect oh how are those two single word to you she's not to be trusted with a plate of macaroons out in it oh oh this is my idea of spending a Sunday afternoons girlfriends that is perfect can we get up every Sunday okay great I Spit on it promise you [Music]
[Music] we're going to make a main course for the holidays that was festive enough but it would feel like the holidays but also that was simple enough that I could make before my guests arrived so I thought seafood grad Tam it'll be just perfectly a little lobster shrimp fish it's going to be wonderful so first I'm going to make a stock I'm going to cook everything in I have two cups of fish stock two cups of cream white wine okay that should be better Cup okay third of a cup of tomato puree it's actually right on the grocery store shelf in between tomato paste and crushed tomatoes and now saffron to get a little bit of heat so one teaspoon of crushed saffron so I have three things shrimp halibut and lobster the shrimp aren't cooked I bought them already peeled and deveined so they just come just like that and I just think for this grant and it's better if they're cut in half crosswise so you're not eating this huge shrimp so that's what I'm going to do kind of like I'd have really big scallops you don't want one big scallop you want the smaller ones [Music] and this way they still look like shrimp to cut them across they wouldn't look like shrimp okay that's one time two shrimp I'm going to put the shrimp right in just give it a little stir I'm going to cook it just until the shrimp are done and it's really fast like three minutes while they're cooking I'm going to get the next thing ready to halibut so we take the skin off the skin you could actually buy this in a fillet but I didn't I bought one steak so just run your knife right along the bone to remove the bone from the middle of it perfect okay what just great simple 1-inch cubes it doesn't have to be perfect just like that okay by now this shrimp should be done you can tell when they're done when they're really firm and they're just turning pink don't want to overcook them because they get tough I'm going to make sauce out of the stock so we'll use everything okay next the halibut panda pal but right in it's going to cook also for about three minutes one pound of cooked lobster these are beautiful comes in one big piece so I'm just going to cut this in chunks and of course if you don't want to do lobster you can always do it with scallops or just two shrimp in hell of it okay that's the lobster and since it's already cooked it's going to bypass the cooking pot and go right into the bowl with the shrimp and I think the halibut should be done so it's firm and just barely cooked so that's going to go right into the bowl okay so I've got all the seafood together and we'll keep cooking the stock until it's reduced by half about ten minutes now go saute the vegetables we're tablespoons of butter leeks and carrots for about five minutes just until they're tender okay in the meantime I'm going to stick in the stock a little bit two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of flour so you just mash them together and I can add it to the stock just stir it in and then I'm going to cook it and it's going to thicken nicely and cream the vegetables look like they're doing really well and another half a cup of wine it's all about getting as much flavor as possible into them in the meantime I'm going to make a topping six tablespoons or butter I use these Japanese flake breadcrumbs which are great you can buy them in the grocery store now and I need two cups they're called panko you can use dry breadcrumbs you really have so much more flavor and texture two thirds of a cup of grated Parmesan - tapping has so much flavor two tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley two tablespoons of chopped fresh tarragon second it's a really delicate flavor it's the kind of thing that goes really well with fish and chicken so about a tablespoon of chopped garlic that's three or four cloves perfect I'm just going to stir it all together for on that melted butter it's going to make a nice crumb topping and so that's the butter and this is really important it not only gives the flavor but it's also going to make sure that it Browns and gets nice and crunchy in the oven so the first thing is the seafood just make sure it's nicely distributed to everybody get some halibut lobster and shrimp the next thing is a vegetable beautiful they are they just starting to caramelize a little bit I'm just going to put those right over the seafood one nice layer looks pretty good doesn't it okay and I'm going to ladle over the sauce just pour it right over I'm just going to pour on enough sauce so it comes up to the sides of the dish and now I'm going to put the crumbs put them right over the top well can't wait till dinner good friends great dinner what more does anybody need you know that looks pretty good just before the party and we bake it at 375 for 20 minutes it's going to be hot and bubbly and crumbly on the top and really good [Music]
[Music] and I used to love to have clambakes at the beach but by the time I got everything down there it was dark it was cold and it was probably fan of the food so I figured out a great way to have a clambake at home all in one pot my friends are coming tonight for clambake in the kitchen and for dessert I'm going to make an apple crostata which is this wonderful sort of rustic apple tart I'll show you how to make it there are two things about making pastry that are really important to remember first ones ice-cold butter and the second ones ice cold water we've all made really bad pastry at one point or not that I'm going to show you how to make sure it's delicious everytime light and flaky so the first thing is a cup of flour and I use all-purpose flour two tablespoons of sugar so salt I'm going to mix it up in the food processor make sure it's blended so the reason why the butter has to be cold is when the heat in the oven hits the pastry dough you want the water on the butter to start to evaporate and it's the steam that makes it light and flaky and it gets totally incorporated in the dough and it doesn't happen so we're going to cut it up in chunks and then put it in the food processor I'll show you how it works really cold butter just ice it like that and put it in and very carefully coat the butter in a little bit of the flour and now I'm just going to pulse it about ten times until it makes the butter about the size of T and now when take the ice cold water two to three tablespoons of water while the processor is going down the feed tube and that's going to make it into a pastry just like that perfect I'm going to Pat it out on a board I'm going to form this new ball I'll leave it in the fridge for about an hour until it's really cold and then we're going to roll it out and fill it with absolutely delicious apple with a little orange it's going to wrap it up in a little parchment paper but if you have plastic wrap that's trying to go into the fridge but meanwhile I'm having clam bake so I better go buy some clam [Music] the first clamps from my kitchen clambake I just want to pick ones that are closed and that they're not too big so we really sweet and last of them [Applause] [Music] great hi Colin so I need three one and a half pound lobsters for my family I'll dress you happen yes I do fantastic they are beautiful kappa if I hold the bag with the best oh this guy doesn't want to go in and can you blame him oh sure oh there's another beauty all right Oh wonderful thank you so much can't wait are there guys [Music] got lots of different kinds of clamps steamers and little next clamp and what do we do now is just wash everything so it's ready for later now put together lobsters and shrimp and kielbasa it's so good so when you're cleaning clams what I want to do is just really brush the outside I actually use a nail brush but you can use a vegetable brush firstly outside and make sure there's no sand on it to brush them well and you want to make sure they're all closed nobody's smiling at you it's nice and tight so these are the clams they're all nice and clean it's a massage that's about two dozen clams and then I have two dozen steamer clams I'm going to do the same thing with these make sure they're closed tight I just scrub them to make sure there's no sand on them it's actually a really easy meal I'm just gonna make a big tomato mozzarella basil salad to start a big clambake and fresh bread to dip into the juice empty corn and a wonderful apple crostata for dessert and then the next thing is muscle the way you clean mussels is you want to get the stand out from the middle so that's two pounds of mussels we put them in water and the trick to taking the sand out I'll show you and what the flour does is they drink the water in the flour and they give off any sand that's inside and you'll see at the end I see the bottom of the bowl so let those sit in the flour and water for a few minutes and we'll get them nice and clean the other thing with mussels do you want to take off what's called the beard which is this little piece that sort of lets them cling to rocks take that off so just keep those guys after I'm going to let that sit for a minute and the last thing is shrimp and it's one and a half pounds of whole shrimp I like to use a large shrimp and it's in the shell don't even have to feel that so it's going to go right in my bowl ready for later take out these muscles let's give it all nice and clean it's such a great thing to do for a party because everybody started connect while there it's real family-style food and everybody connects while they're digging into the lobsters and the clamp from the monthly great and you can see there's a little sand in the water so that's all come out of the nut rope so my seafoods all ready for later I can't wait to make the clambake I've never known a party that wasn't improved with really good cocktails so I'm going to make margaritas to go with my clan big it's really traditional but I make it with a twist I do it with lime and lemon and I think it's really good so the first thing I need to tap a cup of fresh lime juice lime it's really important it's first one to half a cup perfect and that goes in the blender and this is the secret to my margaritas is a lemon the juice of one lemon and for some reason you just isn't much more depth of flavor I love it into the blender and now the good stuff the tequila the curious thing about margaritas I found is they don't come out very good if you use really good tequila you know that dark golden tequila you have to use inexpensive tequila and then they can that great so I'm gonna have a cup of tequila a whole cup in the blender cup of triple sec which is orange flavored liqueur no wonder this over and one or two cups of ice let's go to blend it all together [Applause] [Music] how good is that going to be I think I could take to make sure it's okay dangerous how good it's going to be really wonderful it's got great flavor and it's got a great tequila tape taste I'm gonna put in two big pitches so into the pitcher and when my friends get here I'm going to solve some martini glasses I think this looks great new martini glass and I'm going to shake it with ice and serve it it's going to be really fun and now after the gardens are tomatoes from my tomato mozzarella basil South could be great my special twist is I'm going to use all kinds of really interesting heirloom tomatoes like this wonderful green zebra striped tomato it's actually right but it's green and it's a great stripes on it I love the way it looks and it's totally delicious [Music] these are going to be so great with my other red and yellow tomato [Music] tomato and basil salad can be really good but it can be really boring so I'm going to do it in a totally different way I'm going to make all different kinds of tomatoes these are all called heirloom tomatoes and if you can find them at some kind of produce market it's really fabulous this is sort of a traditional red tomato but then I have yellow tomatoes this is regular cow's milk mozzarella but you can also find buffalo mozzarella which is richer and softer since this recipe only basically has three ingredients tomatoes mozzarella basil you want to make sure they're all really good so don't buy the stuff that tastes like plastic buy this stuff that is like good mozzarella so I'll just slice these guys now they look wonderful and you really want to make this one the tomatoes are ripe this is not a winter salad particularly so I'm just going to serve lay them out very casually and I like a salad wanted to wind up like ducks very sort of casual kind of arrangement they smell so good the yellow tomatoes are actually a little less acidic so I like to combine them with the red tomatoes and then mozzarella very casually and then I'm going to take these little ones and just cut them in the wedges put them right on top and the zebra striped tomatoes some people great they're ripe when they're green that fabulous lime green inside love and they're so sweet and maybe some of these big cherry tomatoes are wonderful don't this look fabulous and fresh basil I'm just going to do big leaks whole leaves on it more leaves tucked in here and then maybe I'll take one big bunch and just put it in the end when you have a platter that have lots of different colors nice have one sort of focus at the end like that and that's a good olive oil drizzle on the top lots of salt it's really important use kosher salt and freshly ground pepper that's not a boring tomato much melon basil salad it's gorgeous I'm just going to leave it right here at room temperature until I'm ready for my clambake so I'm back to my apple crostata Roland's do is peel one and a half pounds of apples about three to four apples depending on how big they are I like to combine one tart and one sweet Apple is nice the key is that you don't want apples that are too soft you want them to have a little firmness to them and I like this tart kind of chunky so I'm going to cut it in big chunks like that okay so that's the apples and I'm going to flavor a little orange if I just think orange sort of brings out that apple flavor and then I'm going to add some other apple pie slices in the topping like cinnamon and allspice so that's the apples and now I'm going to get the crust so remember this has been sitting in the fridge for about an hour so it gets nice and firm and I can roll it out it was beautiful a little bit of flour I'm going to flour the board so doesn't stick this is a beautiful crust I can tell it's really good because they're little bits of butter all the way through the crust when you roll it out so it rolls it that into a circle and then pile the apples into the middle it should be just about right let's put it on a baking sheet just in line with parchment just take your rolling pin and roll it up on that and move it right to the parchment perfect and then we'll pour the apples on top I want to leave like an inch and a half crust around the outside because I'm going to fold the whole thing up okay now I'm going to do the topping course so to make something like a crumble topping that we used to put on an apple pie holers cup of flour quarter of a cup of sugar some salt ground allspice that's really just to give it the serve apple pie flavor and cinnamon I'm going to take a half a stick of butter and dice it up and that's what's going to make it crumbly okay right in here set up a Sonia it's all broken up like that and now I'm going to put it in this bowl and run it in my finger so what makes sort of really crumbly kind of topping putting on top of the apples like that does not look fabulous I'm going to take the edges and fold them right up over the apples to enclose them that look great wonderful in the oven 450 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes and it's going to be just scored and when it comes out the crust is going to be nice and brown and the apples will be bubbly it's going to be so delicious [Music] so this is a big spot I'm gonna put my clambake into what I started with three types of onions and 2 cups of leeks that I've cooked in olive oil for about 10 minutes until they're nice and translucent the next thing I'm going to do is put in 1 and 1/2 pounds of red potatoes right in the bottom so they cook first just so they taste really good 1 tablespoon of soul it sounds like a lot but it's a big clambake and half a tablespoon of cracked pepper and then to flavor at all one and a half pounds of kielbasa this is so good any kind of sausage is really good the kielbasa is already cooked so you don't have to worry about cooking it before and it's got great flavor for the potatoes with cabassa the onions and leeks this is my idea of a Greek lambic it's not outside it's not hot it's not sandy and at the end of the day it's not dark so you can really find your dinner not hunting around like all those parties they use to cable on the beach and then all the seafood so these are all my clean clam and the mussel goes right on top and then shrimp on top of that and then laughters go right on the top in the pan one lobster - lobster three laster's add 2 cups of white wine good white wine you want to taste great right on the top and that's it it could have cook on medium heat for about 15 minutes until you see steam coming out between the top and the lid and then I'm going to turn it down for another 15 minutes and cook it and it will be perfectly done the potatoes on the bottom the kielbasa though all the flavors will go together this shellfish will be cooked and the lobsters on the top it's amazing but it really works okay who wants a margarita we know okay we everybody get a glass right on the table take a piece of blonde yeah and run around the room the glass and then this isn't called margarita all right whoa serious oh yeah this can be really good with a clambake cheers everybody lots of salt perfect rate everything you ever wanted in a margarita have a okay after the margaritas beer choice for take a little beer for spending the night right okay you're going to have to uh say it like that tomorrow my shirt is from your car oh they are some of them actually are they air the green favorite gather all heirloom tomatoes beautiful holy that I guess then I heat it up in the other again actually heats them up a little bit of water so they get nice and crisp okay again for everybody men she would I guess Oh terrific sis and now the main event the clambake lobsters and mussels and clams or they're close to a lot of a lot more I would be rocks elastic people getting foster gets a little claws off and everybody has crackers okay watch this right in the bowl how's that okay slam bang for everybody it's all hair it can't all hands on fabulous house is mine will sit right in and for the dad listen playing tennis if teachers ready to lock this is so easy it's incredible and there's no it's an assistant we don't have to look all the staff [Laughter] and it's ginger apple crostata looks like a rough apple tart mmm that is the best thing I've ever had ever ever I think Deborah I love it [Laughter]
[Music] my husband Jeffrey is so amazing he's working full-time on his new business and now he has a new book contract - I think that's worth celebrating so making him an old-fashioned bistro dinner and an old-fashioned cocktail to go with it we're going to start with real whiskey sours the kind our parents used to drink then filet of beef au poivre juicy steaks seared with spicy cracked pepper and a sauce made with brandy and shallots on the side crispy matchstick potatoes and for dessert delicious strawberry tarts with sweet pastry vanilla cream and luscious berries Jeffrey works so hard all week there's nothing like a home-cooked meal to make him feel really glad he's home [Music] when Jeffrey and I go to Paris all we want to do immediately is have French bread and French pastries French bread it's really hard to make the same here but fruit tarts that can be really good so I'm gonna treat Jeffrey with strawberry tarts I'm gonna make the pastry first and you want to start with really really cold ingredients it makes a really flaky pastry so I froze this it's one and a quarter cups of flour 3 tablespoons of sugar a little sweetness and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and then I'm gonna have lots of good butter so 3/4 of a stick of butter and I'm gonna combine that with 2 tablespoons of vegetable shortening that way you get the flavor of the butter but the flakiness of the vegetable shortening 1 and 2 I actually keep the vegetable shortening the refrigerator keep it nice and cold okay I'm just gonna process it until the butter is the size of peas you want to be able to see the butter in the pastry okay now I need a quarter of a cup of ice water just like the rest of the ingredients you want the water really really cold that's good and cold just gonna pour it right through the food too [Music] and then just pulse it until it becomes a bowl of dough perfect I don't know about you but I always think pastry is terrifying it's not that hard though okay just dump it on a board really careful this is incredibly sharp I can't tell you how many times I've cut myself on it and just roll this into a ball so this dough is gonna make about four fruit tarts individual ones but since I only need two for Jeffrey and me I'm gonna cut it in half and half a rest in the refrigerator and half we're gonna freeze for later so while the dough's chillin in a pastry cream pastry cream is a lot like creme anglaise vanilla cream but it's got a little extra cornstarch so instead of worrying about boiling and ending up with scrambled eggs you can cook it until it's really thick so I'm gonna start with one and a half cups of scalded milk you don't want to boil it okay I'm gonna get all the other ingredients ready so I've got five egg yolks and the 3/4 of a cup of sugar and then beat these together until they're really really thick [Music] okay this is done I'm gonna show you what it looks like when you get a really thick sort of ribbon just like that really thick okay so next thing I'm gonna do is turn the mixer on low and add three tablespoons of cornstarch ports are just really like flour like adding flour to a gravy or something allows you to boil it without having it curdle mix that in but I'm gonna get the scalded milk good that's perfect not boiling just slowly add this in okay now I'm gonna put the bowl thing back in the pan and just cook it I [Music] really just want to stir this you don't wanna burn the bottom but the good news is you can make it in advance and keep it in the refrigerator well it gets really thinking on a whisk this is the point where it who is creme anglaise it would become scrambled eggs but because of the cornstarch you can cook it until it's really thick perfect look how gorgeous that is okay and then I'm gonna add some flavor so first vanilla and cognac why don't have teaspoons of vanilla use pure vanilla extract it really makes a difference one teaspoon of cognac maybe more than a teaspoon no pay no tablespoon of butter I'm just gonna melt into it and a tablespoon of heavy cream to stir it all together and now just think if there are a few lumps I'm gonna sieve it someone's just pour it right through the sieve so the butter melted and all the flavors are combined it's another gorgeous no it's nice and smooth and then I'm gonna chill it until it's nice and cold and no lumps okay I'm gonna take a little plastic wrap and just put it in sit it on the ball right directly on the pastry cream I'm gonna make sure that a skin doesn't form so I'm going to chill this and I think the Pistor should be cold enough to roll at man [Music] so the pastry for my strawberry tarts is really cold the only way to make it really flaky pastry so little flour on the board I'm gonna cut this into because it makes two fruit tarts you just roll each one out keep it nice and round so in your only pastry you want the world from the center out I keep it as even as possible just make sure it keeps moving there's no point in having gorgeous pastry that sticks to the board okay now this is a really key moment when you put the pastry in you don't want to stretch it at all all of us including me I've done pastry that shrinks after you bake it and that's because you've stretched it when you put it into the pan I learned that the hard way and then really easy just take the rolling pin run along the top take off the excess I cut one track challenge okay then I have little pieces of butter aluminum foil and it's just buttered on the inside state doesn't stick to the pastry you want to fill these with beans and that'll keep it from puffing up okay when we bake the tart shells 375 for about 10 minutes then take the beans in the foil out with forklift little holes in the bottom put them back in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes until they're nice and brown and when they're cool I'm gonna fill them pastry cream and fresh strawberry jell-o [Music] so I'm making a really special dinner for Jeffrey and for dessert I'm making fruit tarts strawberry tarts I'm starting with hulling the strawberries I actually like to do half strawberries really depends on how big they are if they're gigantic they can be quarters so I've got the tart shells that I've already baked off and they're cool I'm gonna fill them with pastry cream it's a lot of pastry cream but it lasts really well in the refrigerator so I can use it for all kinds of things just fill that tart shell the good news you can make all these elements in advance paste your cream the tart shells and then just fill them my pastry cream is nice and smooth and it's beautifully flavored with vanilla in connieyc okay strawberries I started from the outside for the points going out you want to layer it because it's really all about the strawberries you can really use grapes raspberries what I'm making fruit tart so I always try and pick fruit that's in season so it tasted really good it's strawberry don't okay I'm gonna grow some of that percussion through the surprise on the top so what are you some kind of jelly like apricot jelly or if you have raspberry jelly that's good too but I like a nice apricot jelly just a little drop of water to make it thin heat it up and it makes the outside of the tart so shiny and just delicious looking but it also keeps the moisture in the tart okay that's it then I'm gonna just brush on the top of the tart see what it does so it makes it really pretty I actually glaze the pastry cream to the whole thing and that just keeps it really moist and now you can't really just add something a little contrast to it it can be a sprig of mint that you having a garden or in the fridge but I love to do something special I love shelled pistachios you're gonna do it just sort of sprinkle some on top and then with fresh strawberries the sweetness you get a little the crunch of pistachios and that's all ready for dessert that who wouldn't love please I'm just gonna let them sit at room temperature until I'm ready to serve them for dessert when I was a little girl my father used to drink whiskey sours and of course he would give me the cherry so I developed a taste for whiskey sours it's a classic drink that's back in fashion again first I'm gonna make them mix I need 3/4 of a cup of whiskey pour it into a beaker or a pitcher most whiskey sours when you get them at restaurants are actually made with sour mix which I hate that this is made with fresh lemon juice of fresh lime juice and a simple sugar syrup so I need 1/2 a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice it already smells good [Music] pick up freshly squeezed lime juice you really have to use fresh lime just don't even think about using the bottled once [Music] picture the last thing I need is simple syrup and what it is is a cup of sugar and a cup of water that I cooked and chilled and it just makes it very simple syrup that I can sweeten this with so 2/3 of a cup of simple syrup so that's the mix later I'm going to shake it with ice maraschino cherry martini glass that's gonna be really good and now we're gonna go to the butcher for some steaks [Music] for years they used to come to the butcher counter and go there's so many options I don't know which one I want so for a while I made a study of steaks and I found it really depends on two things your taste and exactly what you're doing so for grilling I found I really like a ribeye steak it's particularly wonderful or New York strip steak which is also called the shell steak for roasting I like a nice fillet of beef and today I'm gonna make Jeffrey something special so I need steaks that are filet I feel how are you were you nice to see you today nice to see you I need some filet mignon please no problem Oh that'd be great to station that would be wonderful thanks Bill so I'm gonna do recipe what would I tell people to look for Nate the marbling is is one of the things to texture the meat the color that not necessarily a bright red piece of meat something is bright in the case and then there's a nice dark one I'd go for the dark one you can set more flavor thank you so much bill it's always wonderful you will [Music] nothing says French Bistro food like matchstick potatoes so I'm going to show you how to make them once I peel the potato I'm gonna take a little slice off the end so it lies flat on the board it's easier to slice and now I'm just gonna slice it really thin like an eighth of an inch thick and then I'm gonna slice it in the other direction so we'll end up with matchsticks that's how great this looks okay I'm just gonna soak them in cold water it's actually amazing how much you get out of one potato actually if you want to do them in advance you can just leave them in the cold water but I'm gonna make them right now and then drain them paper towels want them really dry before they go in the hot oil otherwise it just splatter all over the place okay they're ready to go into the oil so the oil is getting hot I needed it 350 degrees kandi tomorrow is great for them right in the Bob okay 350 exactly and go the potatoes nice and dry stand back and they're gonna cook for about three to five minutes I actually leave the thermometer in so I can just check temperatures gonna drop crazy-like to 200 or something so I'm just gonna turn off the heat to get it back to 350 back nothing like the smell of french fries I'm just gonna move this around a little bit so they don't stick together boys it's gonna be good with steak au poivre Jeffrey's not gonna know what hit him okay so when they're nice and golden-brown just take them out of the hot oil drain them don't this look great I'm gonna salt them and then I'm gonna keep them warm in a 350 degree oven while I make the steak this is a great time for good sea salt or fleur de sel well I think I have to try one mmm so onto a sheet pan went to the oven and they'll stay warm until I'm ready to serve dinner [Music] staple problems really easy to make this crack pepper is wonderful and it just press it right into the steaks actually crack the pepper and a little coffee grinder which is great then you get really fresh pepper okay I've got half a tablespoon of butter have a tablespoon of oil I'm just gonna put the steaks right in sizzle I'm gonna cook them for about four minutes on one side until they're really Brown and then flip them over and cook them for three to four minutes on the other side till they're medium-rare who can resist that I think they're just perfect and they are I'm gonna put them on a plate and let them rest for a bit it really brings the juices back and then I'm gonna make a sauce cover it with foil keep them nice and warm okay I'm just gonna pour some of the fat off just leave maybe one tablespoon and I've got one big shallot saute that for a minute until they get nice and tender and then a third of a cup of beef broth don't make your own unless you have some around good canned beef broth is just fine [Music] okay I'm just gonna let this reduce by half it'll take about five or six minutes nothing like some ice-cold whiskey sours to get Jeffrey in a party mood [Music] hey have a celebratory whiskey sour to your new book may one day be completed you almost ready for dinner I'm done right now dinner's ready okay I'll be there well the cocktail didn't get his undivided attention but something tells me steak au poivre will oh this looks beautiful it's reduced I'm gonna add cognac and butter some screaming - of cognac reduce it a little bit and then add the butter I'm so good I love it I can really smell the shallots and the cognac it's gonna be really good on the steaks okay I'm gonna get everything else ready [Music] a little bit of butter in this sauce just sort of wanted to melt not dissolve [Music] why do I think this is gonna get another to study in a hurry Oh sweetie dinner's ready [Music] just stay free anymore too many more stick free so I thought I'm making a classic strawberry tart with pastry cream fresh strawberries but have it if I make you steak au poivre when you start every book and when you finish every book I'm up with that and what about in the middle oh well I guess it's roast chicken [Music]
[Music] what I've done is donate lunch and an auction to raise money to preserve the Hamptons and the people who won the auction are coming for lunch today yikes I'm making Asian grilled salmon for the crust infused with ginger and scallions served with a crunchy noodle salad with a peanut dressing that's packed with flavors and for dessert my classic lemon cake updated with yogurt and fresh blueberry sauce this is gonna be fun so the first thing I'm gonna make for my lunch today was that getting facial is a crunchy noodle salad with lots of Asian spices so I'm going to start with thin pasta actually like thin spaghetti for it it seems to absorb the flavor the best just put that in the bowl so the first thing I do is do some vegetables peppers and scallions then I'm gonna make a great sauce for it so red peppers I'm doing a salad like this I just find it it's nice to have straight pieces of julienned peppers so that just run my knife down the edge the rest of this is for snacking later I'm just cut them right down the middle I like when things are sort of the same size as the pasta these are Hollin peppers I find they're really great year-round but if you have local peppers you can use those too okay the next thing is sugar snap peas about a pound I'm gonna salt the water and then grab them for about three to five minutes just until they're crisp tender while that's happening I'm gonna cut up some scallions just chop their little Enzo off and then I'm just gonna run my knife right down the middle okay just big rough chop okay first sky is going to the salad and the red peppers the next thing is the sugar snap peas but I'm gonna shock them first which means taking them out of the boiling water putting them in ice water to stop the cooking really sets the color and it stops them from getting overcooked it just takes a second perfect just make sure they're really cold and they are right into the salad it's really cold okay now the sauce it's got great flavor okay the first thing is a cup of vegetable oil I don't use olive oil here because I'm not the other Asian flavors to come out so I wanted it clear oil there's no flavor right into the bowl a quarter of a cup of rice wine vinegar you find this in the Asian section new grocery store third of a cup of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil this isn't the clear one paste the one that's the dark one it's got lots of flavor one tablespoon of honey give it a little sweetness and two cloves of chopped garlic okay the next things fresh ginger it's a route like this just great and you want to peel it and then I'm gonna grate it this is classic Asian spice fresh ginger I love it it's really woody so the finer you grade it the better especially if it's we're not cooking it bini as it ran just grate it like this this is really tough so you want to be sure that the rasp is really sharp the ginger is not only gonna give it lots of flavor but it's gonna give it some heat which is great so what is the spoon of grated ginger if you want it hotter you can always put more in okay and this is the good stuff half cold peanut butter that's really what gives it sort of an Indonesian flavor and you want to use smooth peanut butter and then just whisk it all together you can make this sauce way in advance and you can make the salad in advance but not too far because actually the soy sauce will break down the noodles so if it's sitting for a day or two it's gonna get really kind of mushy not pretty so that's the dressing it smells great it's gonna be really good on the noodles I think the last thing gonna put in the sauce is some toasted sesame seeds i toasted them in a dry pan just put about two tablespoons in I'm gonna save the rest to decorate the salad okay right on the salad so this is the warm noodles are you spaghetti pin spaghetti and the scallions sugar snap peas red peppers toss it all together I like lots of sauce on it this looks wonderful I'm so good with the Asian salmon mmm looks colorful I've got lots of flavors I think it just needs two things need some chopped parsley three tablespoons I love the look of fresh green herbs on something just makes it look like it has lots of flavor just a rough chop and then some more sesame seeds so it looks like sesame toss it all together mmm smells so good on the peanut sauce of the soy and all the flavors hit the hot pasta can really smell it lots of vegetables it's gonna be delicious and next I'm gonna make a lemon yogurt cake it's not only good but it's good for you I know ever a petition for starting every recipe with a pound of butter but this one's actually a lemon cake that's made with yogurt and vegetable oil so it's it's even good for you and it's delicious so I'm going to start with the dry ingredients one and a half cups of flour two teaspoons of baking powder and a half teaspoon of salt just sift those together okay one cup of yogurt I use whole milk yogurt I think this gives a good flavor okay one cup of sugar you can make it with that butter but not with that sugar okay three extra-large eggs I was break them into another Bowl just in case you get a bad egg I always use room-temperature eggs and I'm baking really makes the cake slider half a teaspoon of vanilla extract two teaspoons of lemon zest that's actually that the zest of one lemon just right into the bowl this is what gives it all its flavor I actually think the zest has more flavor than the juice so whenever I make something with lemon I always put the zest in it smells good already and then later we're gonna use the juice and make a syrup lemon syrup for it that's about two teaspoons okay I'm just gonna whisk it all together the idea for this recipe actually came from a recipe I saw that my friend Dorie Greenspan wrote for yogurt cake and I thought I'm gonna be interesting to see if I can adapt my lemon cake into a lemon yogurt cake worked beautifully okay I'm just gonna take the dry ingredients whisk them in I'm just gonna toss them with my hand make sure they're well mixed and just slowly whisk them in [Music] you want to whisk them just enough until it's stirred but not over mix it I love that you can make this without a mixer okay the next thing I need is a half a cup of vegetable oil just a flavorless oil just stir it in [Music] so what are we so interesting to have two people come for lunch that I've never met before but Doug and Paige Campbell are gonna be like okay into the pan I've greased and floured a loaf pan just pour this right in that was pretty easy k wasn't it perfect into the oven 350 degrees for about 50 minutes and then I'm gonna drizzle it with a lemon glaze [Music] so the lemon yogurt kick is out of the oven and while it cools I'm gonna make a lemon syrup just pour over it make it even better so I need 1/3 of a cup of lemon juice need a little more [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're gonna heat it up with third of a cup of sugar [Music] it's gonna let that come to a boil until it becomes just very clear take a few minutes I'm gonna see if I can get my cake out of the pan so this cake has lemon zest in it there's lemon juice on it and if that's not enough I make blueberry sauce for it came out perfectly just gonna cook this until it becomes clear until the sugar dissolves you know these guys spent a lot of money for this lunch I hope it's good enough for them okay this is perfect sugars dissolved I'm just gonna spoon it right over the cake and then what it does is it just soaks right into the cake keeps it really moist it has lots of great moments over I hope they'll take lemon ever chocolate any day so this good just the way it is but for the fresh blueberry sauce you'd be better [Music] I'm a New Yorker kick on its own it's just fine but since these guests are really special I'm gonna make a blueberry sauce for the cake we'll make it into a whole dessert so the first thing I'm gonna do is take three half pints of fresh blueberries then I'm gonna prove Anila sugar in it and what it is is sugar that I've immersed vanilla beans in you can buy in the store or you can make it yourself after I take the seeds out of the vanilla beans I just put the pods right in here and it smells absolutely amazing I love this I've had this jar I think for 20 years I just keep adding vanilla and sugar to it so I need one and a half cups of vanilla sugar that's one cup and another half try and get it into the cup and on the counter okay that's perfect okay plus a third of a cup of water I'm just gonna cook this together bring you to a simmer for about 15 minutes and then later I'm gonna add some fresh lemon juice while that's cooking though the marinade Asian salmon except for the main course for my lunch I'm gonna make one of my favorite dishes Eli's Asian salmon Eva I say bars were my dearest friends and he makes this in his restaurants in his stores it's so good I'm gonna pour cup of soy sauce a quarter of a cup of rice vinegar it's got a lot of ingredients but it's really worth it in terms of the flavor it's so good the quarter of a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice but not a lot of fish can really stand up to this kind of flavor but Sam and cam okay the next thing is two tablespoons of oyster sauce it's a very classic Asian sauce it's sweet and spicy that's 2 tablespoons 1 tablespoon of fish sauce which is incredibly salty use it sparingly tablespoon of sesame oil which I also used in the noodles I'm wondering 1/2 teaspoons of chili paste and sometimes there's garlic in it sometimes it doesn't it doesn't matter but it's got lots of heat so use it sparingly okay next thing is choose scallions chopped just sort of a rough chop I think about Eli's food that always amazes me is how simple it is and how incredibly flavorful everything he does is to enhance the basic ingredients and that's what this doesn't make the salmon taste incredibly delicious ok scallion goes in then I have 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh ginger and 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh garlic okay I'm just gonna stir this up I'm gonna pour 1/3 of it right over the salmon just don't let the salmon and then I'm gonna use something unusual it's panko which is Japanese breadcrumbs about a cup and a half if you can't find them and you can really find them in the grocery section now but if you can't find them you can just use dry breadcrumbs I'm just gonna put right over the top of this it makes like a bread crust that's just so delicious and it's gonna absorb all of the marinade so really absorbs a lot of the flavor and it makes a nice top crust on it it's fantastic and the rest of the sauce goes right over it just pour it really carefully over the top don't worry if some of it falls off you can just put it right back on I'm just gonna spoon any sauce right over the top that's of the aluminum foils for to make sure it all stays in good let it marinate for about 15 minutes I'm gonna finish my blueberry sauce and I think the candle should be here just about them [Music] Eli's Asian Salmons been marinating for about 15 minutes and it's really nice it's got a nice breadcrumb and scallion crust when I bake it 500 degrees thread 20 minutes it's gonna be really crisp on the top and so juicy inside be sure your oven is very clean before you turn it on 500 degrees that's gonna be delicious so the sauce is reduced is so nice and thick it's amazing there isn't vanilla sugar can really smell it smells wonderful now what I'm going to do is just strain it and all it is really is blueberries and sugar and vanilla and if you press the berries through the sieve end up with a really nice thick sauce and you get to use all the blueberry let's see you can see some right there I'm gonna add a little bit of lemon juice to it you just think a little bit of acidity sort of cuts the sugar a little bit of lemon juice in it just a touch of lemon juice better half a tablespoon just really gives a saw some more depth of flavor and that's it I'm really small the fresh blueberries and vanilla sugar a little bit of lemon juice just gonna let that cool just to be delicious on the lemon yogurt cake and desserts ready so the fish is done it looks great just like meat it's a good idea to let fish rest so what you want to do is just cover with aluminum foil cover it pretty tightly and all the juices will get back into the fish and to be moist and delicious all ready to go for lunch yeah for you oh they're so gorgeous are you come on pitch like it just miss that and absolutely delicious so what's the secret ingredient in salmon I've got ginger and soy sauce and scallions and all kinds of flavors we might be taking this recipe [Music] thank you if there are glaze on top of the cake definitely fresh lemon juice glaze it's a little bit of sugar and lemon juice cook together and it's what keeps the cake so moist it's nice it's not too overwhelming plum and it's just the right amount well here's to new friends and the Hamptons
[Music] since my husband Jeffrey is away during the week we try to make the most of our weekends one of his favorite things to do is go to the beach offseason so today I thought we'd take a nice long walk and they're bringing hot soup and then we're gonna come home for luxurious lunch with wine something tells me there's gonna be an app to follow first I'll make french onion soup with Greer croutons to take to the beach and a thermos when we get home there will be delicious goat cheese tart with garlic and herbs served with heirloom tomato and fennel salad and a lemony vinaigrette and for dessert an outrageous chocolate orange mousse and the best part is everything will be made in advance so when we get home there's nothing more difficult to do than get the sand out of our shoes okay my putting you in charge of some wine for lunch yeah this is Harry hope you know what to get yeah great so happen if I move to the beach of an hour so okay okay see them I'm gonna go finish lunch okay but isn't it creme de menthe why do I think there's gonna be a cookie involved [Music] he's so adorable so I wanted to make a dessert for Jeffrey that he'd really love and he loves chocolate mousse I don't know any guy that doesn't so I'm gonna make a chocolate mousse with orange with Grand Marnier and orange zest so first thing I want to do is melt six ounces of semi-sweet chocolate choose good chocolate just putting this in a double boiler you don't need a formal double boiler just any kind of a heat proof ball that can sit over simmering water is perfect and I'm also gonna use two ounces of bittersweet chocolate real chocolate lovers love bittersweet chocolate but I just think it's too bitter it's as sort of to me a little bit of a chalky taste so I like to combine the two so semi-sweet chocolate with a little bit of bitter it gives it a sort of a rounder flavor so that's the chocolate quarter of a cup the four water this is my favorite ingredient a quarter of a cup of Grand Marnier which is an orange liqueur because it's so much flavor mmm love the smell of that one teaspoon of good vanilla extract it's a really important flavor for chocolate and one teaspoon of grated orange zest which is gonna really heighten the orange flavor actually the orange is really interesting because the Grand Marnier makes the chocolate a little sweeter and the zest makes it a little bitter so it's kind of like adding the semi-sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate together so we'll just let this melt I'm gonna stir it a little bit then I'm gonna turn off the heat let it cool a little bit and add the orange zest that make good chocolate mousse without lots of eggs so the egg yolks go into the mixture and then the whites lighten it so I need eight eggs separated you know in France when you get chocolate mousse they very often serve a family-style they bring you a huge bowl of chocolate mousse and you're supposed to take one portion my husband Jeffrey didn't know that one time when he was very young and went to France on his own they brought him a huge bowl of chocolate mousse and he helped himself to some and then he thought I think I'll take a little more it was really good and then he had a little more and boy did he regret it the next day and I can imagine the proprietor thinking he ain't the whole thing oops I got a little egg yolk in here this is the way to get egg yolk out of egg whites take the shell and just dip it right in and you'll see the egg yolk goes right into the shell if you try and do it with a spoon it'll never work this is great chocolates melted take it off the heat I'm just gonna let that sit until it cools and then later I'll add the orange zest but first I'm gonna beat the egg yolks and sugar okay and egg yolks I have a cup of sugar so I'm gonna whip this for about four minutes until it's pale yellow and very dense and it sort of falls back on itself in a ribbon [Music] so it add some flavor to the chocolate one teaspoon of the grated orange zest and I need butter and it has to be room temperature butter this is why it's really important for the chocolate to be room temperature and the butter because they need to mix them in without the butter melted so one of them sticks of butter remember this makes a lot of chocolate mousse with these together just mix that in however you need to do it with a spoon or a whisk just important that it's a creamy texture when it's done and gifts are perfect if you lift the beater what falls back into the ball falls back on a perfect ribbon so it's really thick and light yellow perfect for the chocolate just going to turn it on low and then add the chocolate this is great when you have Jeffrey's getting on at the wine shop hope you bring somewhere bottle fine knowing Jeffrey you could come home with scotch [Music] look I'm in a high state attention here okay ina sent me for some wine and I don't know what kind you want so I'm gonna rely on you sure okay what are you guys we're having a goat cheese tart no cheese time right so what do you suggest um you know what just let's do a simple good crispy Grigio it's 12 bucks great look it looks terrific yeah the grape all the wine for the price okay are you really sure right I'm very sure okay time to finish the chocolate mousse so this is the chocolate semi-sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate orange zest and Grand Marnier and then I'm gonna lighten it with egg whites and beaten cream this is one cup of egg whites tablespoon of sugar and a little bit of salt they're stiff but not firm and dry so just whisk this in it's lighten it I think I'm gonna have a very happy hubby loves chocolate mousse okay that's Whiston and you don't want to tap this out of the bowl because anything that deflates the egg whites makes the chocolate mousse dancer don't want to do that and now just take the rest of it and just fold it in this is perfect folding technique if you take your rubber spatula and go down right down in the middle and then fold it from the side and you'll deflate the egg whites a little as possible and really mix it in just keep turning the bowl and fold it in okay a little bit of whipped cream give it two richness you can add cream to bowl that has egg whites in it but you can't do the reverse because the fat and the cream won't allow the egg whites to beat so I did the egg whites first and now the cream so 1/2 a cup of cream take a spoon of sugar just whip that until it's dead cold cream lips better perfect so I'm just gonna fold the cream in you see it really makes a difference just adds a little bit of richness which gives the chocolate much more flavor and again I'm going to fold this in right down through the middle up through the side just folding it over until it's incorporated mmm I can smell the chocolate and orange together it's actually one of my favorite combinations fill these little cups then later I'm going to decorate them with whipped cream and mandarin oranges who wouldn't want that for dessert [Music] thank you I'd love one of these cookies they look so great [Music] I promised Jeffrey a nice romantic walk on the beach before lunch today but no no no the weather report looks cold and rainy so I thought maybe I'd make some hot French onion soup and we'll go to the beach but maybe we'll leave it in the car so what I've done is I've sautéed that two and a half pounds of yellow onions and some butter and a bay leaf until they're really nice and caramelized and browned so now I'm gonna get to things some sherry and some kind yak but half a cup of each and what that's gonna do is it's gonna deglaze the pan from the onions but it's also gonna have lots of great flavor have a cup of sherry its medium dry sherry you don't want too sweet sherry because I don't want sweet onions and half a cup of cognac you can also use brandy cognac is brandy from the cognac region of France and just let that cook for about five minutes get all those brown crusty bits off the pan let the flavors get into the onions so why don't half cups of a dry white wine it's a Chardonnay which is really good this is just gonna cook for about 15 minutes in the meantime I think I'll make a goat cheese tart while Geoffrey's away I wonder what he's up to oh this looks great but if I have a bite of it I'm I'm gonna ruin my appetite maybe I just have a little bit just a little [Music] this is goat cheese I need an 11 ounce piece I chose the 1 and 1/2 ounces and it usually comes in this size package sometimes Co Montrachet and I get it with garlic and herbs I'm a very creamy there's a lot of flavor and it's wonderful for this tart so when do to make the filling just put 11 and a half ounces of garlic and herb goat cheese 1 cup of cream 3 eggs quarter cup of fresh basil about 1/4 teaspoon of salt eighth of a teaspoon of pepper you puree [Music] I don't affect at Art Show when I saw tape some shallots a little bit of butter in oil put that on the bottom I'm gonna pour the filling over or just in sick right so it's gonna bake 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until it begins to set the way custard would it's gonna be really good for lunch so French onion soup last thing I want to do is put in 4 cups of chicken stock and four cups of beef stock now I make chicken stock myself and I buy beef stock in a can you can do whatever you like but I think it really makes a different step good stock just mix that together it's beginning to look like French bean soup tablespoon of salt depending on how salty the stocks are half a teaspoon of pepper you can use white pepper black pepper but I really prefer black just stir it around [Music] so let that simmer away for about 20 minutes all the flavors are just gonna be wonderful and while that happens I think I'll make a tomato and fennel salad then I'll meet Jeffrey of the beach the French onion soup you have to have croutons so since we're taking it to the beach I thought I'd make them separately and we'll have these crackers so what I did is I just took slices of French bread olive oil salt and pepper and then shredded Gruyere on the top and baked it for a few minutes until it's nice and crisp and they're gonna be delicious with a French onion soup and I think the goat cheese tart smells like it's ready how pretty is that so let that cool it's best served at room temperature and now I'm gonna make a tomato offense out so with the goat cheese tart I thought it'd be really nice to have tomato and fennel salad I'm gonna make it with a lemon vinaigrette this is fennel I love it it has an anise flavor and this is the bulb of the fennel and this is the fronds and I'm gonna use both of them in the salad so just take the fronds off and reserve them for later it's kind of they look like deal and then just cut off the stalks don't really want to eat them they're very tough and you're left with the bulb so just take the bulb cut it in half cut out the little core I sometimes make this with an orange vinaigrette but today I thought the fennel and lemon would be perfectly great and I'm just gonna slice this very thinly across then one was a fairly strong flavour when it's raw when it's cooked it's just wonderful okay so that's the film these are great heirloom tomatoes there are they come in all different colors and flavors with the dish this simple you want to be sure that you're using really good ingredients just Tomatoes fennel and a little vinaigrette [Music] be sure you don't put tomatoes in the refrigerator they're really best when they're left at room temperature and then I have these wonderful little cherry tomatoes all different colors I would have the small ones and quarter the bigger ones okay that should do it and then I'm going to take the fennel and just let's turn across the top of it now I'm gonna make a vinaigrette two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice [Applause] two tablespoons of good olive oil one tablespoon of cider vinegar it was sweet salt [Music] just whisk it together I just pour it right up [Music] and then just as a Cornish I'm just going to take these fennel fronds just chop them up so this can just sit at room temperature that's gonna be delicious with a goat cheese tart French onion soup looks great just gorgeous so this is the thermos so we can take it to the beach it's a messy job but worthwhile croutons nice and cold like little bags with three times each of us three are croutons two mugs thermos of French onion soup and I'm off to the beach is it cold enough for you at the beach but a crew time to go with it we got a four-course meal yeah what's real French onion soup isn't it I think we should go for a walk on the beach before it gets even colder sounds like a good idea I'm gonna finish the chocolate mousse I love to decorate something with the ingredients that are in it so you know exactly what it is so I'm going to decorate it with whipped cream and a little bit of orange this is just casual heavy cream a little bit of sugar - and vanilla I speed that's it usually what I do is pipe it on with a pastry tube but you know I think this should just be casual just a da buff cream a mandarin orange it's simple it's delicious he's gonna be very handsome and will have a lot more for later if anybody comes to visit and two for Jeffrey and me just getting everything ready for lunch so the first thing that happens to goat cheese tart [Music] just hope it's good [Music] I can smell the goat cheese in the garlic and arms [Music] and the tomato and fennel similar level of flavors in this lemon and fennel Tomatoes perfect [Music] okay some bread and Stoppers [Music] a little white wine let's pinkie-swear it's a nice nap and the best thing is Jeffrey's gonna think I'm really smart that I can get lunch ready in five minutes after the beach only we'll know the truth
[Music] my friends Devin and Eli are coming for dinner tonight and they're bringing their incredibly chic Parisian friends so I thought instead of making a French dinner I would make something very American all with local ingredients it's one of my favorite meal [Music] except for my very American dinner I thought I'd use all the local ingredients so I'm gonna make roast duck with Long Island duck sauteed corn with wonderful corn from Jim pecks con stand right here and because the apples are wonderful in the orchard I'm gonna make an apple crisp with really good vanilla ice cream so for my Ducks aren't these great I don't know about you but I always imagined roasting ducks is like smoke billowing out of the oven fat everywhere I have a better method what you do is you boil them for about 45 minutes and a lot of the fat comes out in the stock and then you roast them at high temperature and they're crisp and moist and absolutely delicious so I'm going to show you how so the first thing that I do is just take a fork and prick the skin a little bit not into the meat but just through the skin and that allows a lot of the fat to come out when it's boiled and I'm gonna put it in 6 quarts of chicken stock canned chicken stocks just fine with some salt and then I'm just gonna put these ducks right and let's chicken stock carefully it's hot and because Ducks tend to float we all know that I'm gonna put a plate on the top and it'll keep them submerged in the hot stock so I'm just gonna simmer this for 45 minutes and after they're done I'm gonna roast them at really high temperature and they're gonna be really good perfect and now I'm gonna work on dessert so for dessert I'm gonna make apple crisp with the local apples from the farm and vanilla ice cream all I'm gonna do is flavor the cream chill it and then put in an ice cream maker it's really easy and it's so good so I want to start with 3 cups of heavy cream it's gonna heat it a little bit 2/3 of a cup of sugar just like that just pour the sugar right in with the cream I'm heating it because I want to dissolve the sugar I have to admit this my favorite flavor of ice cream and with the apple crisp I think it's gonna be really good I think you know is underrated as a flavor but you need to use really good vanilla since it's the only flavor in the ice cream one teaspoon of vanilla good vanilla extract and then because the vanilla is really important I'm gonna put the seeds of a vanilla bean in so just take a bean and slice it all the way down the middle the really sharp knife and then pull it apart and then take your knife and just run it right along the inside and those little seeds that come out are the vanilla seeds and it's great flavor so just stir this over medium heat just for a few minutes until the sugar dissolves and you can tell because you can sort of feel a little bit of grittiness when the sugar still they are and that's really all you have to do is just dissolve the sugar take it off the heat just strain it you can see all those little vanilla seeds in that mixture and it's going to flavor it's going to be just wonderful I'm gonna chill it and then freeze it my ice cream maker later back to the Ducks so they've been simmering for about 45 minutes let's plate in there not the Ducks going to take the plate out that just holds them down so they're submerged be really careful it's nothing worse than putting your hand up pot of boiling stock oh they look great I'm gonna roast them next so it's really only two stages you boil them and then you roast them the first thing I'm gonna do is take a little bit of the fat off the top of the stock and put it in the roasting pan just so the Ducks don't stick while they're roasting and it's amazing how much fat is in the top of this the good news is you won't be eating it okay just all that around and now put the Ducks in ducks so just do this really carefully because you've got a pot of hot style well there's a lot of stock in here but what I do is I put it in the freezer and I save it for the next time I'm making ducks so I don't have to do six quarts of stock every time and it get just gets better and better yeah okay a second little guy wonderful and now I'm just gonna dry the top so the skin gets really nice and crisp when it's roasting just Pat the top dry like that teaspoon of salt we want to really season it well want them to have lots of flavor it's been a pepper [Music] thirty minutes 500 degrees and we're gonna have delicious ducks my vanilla ice cream mixture is nice and chill so I'll show you how easy it is now to make ice cream we all remember when it was ice and salt and hand-crank things at least I do and now it's just a frozen canister and that's what the freezing is with a blade it's a great little electric ice cream maker just pour the chilled mixture right in I wanna make sure I get all the vanilla beans and all that gorgeous flavor right in now all I have to do is turn it on and all by itself it makes the best vanilla ice cream to go with apple crisp for dessert I can't wait this vanilla ice cream looks incredible it's gonna go with the apple crisp and I think I need to taste it make sure it's okay mmm it's like sweet and vanilla whipped cream but frozen it's so good tonight I'm gonna serve it with the apple crisp so I'm gonna put it in a container put it in the freezer it gets a little harder but then I'll leave it at room temperature for a few minutes until it gets soft enough to scoop out I mean who needs apple crisp this is so wonderful so see how easy it is to make really good ice cream [Music] [Music] so when I was thinking about making a dinner with local ingredients I thought about the apple orchard the milk pail which I just love the apples are really ripe so I went to the milk pail and I got mccune and McIntosh apples I like the combination once a little sweeter and ones a little tartar and then you get the best of both flavors and the apple crisp okay I'm just going to cut them like big chunks it's 5 pounds of apples it sounds like a lot that they really cook down and you want a big high apple crisp okay that's the apples and I'm just gonna flavor them so I'd love to use citrus with apples so I'm going to use the zest and the juice of one orange and one lemon so lots of orange zest you always want exactly orange before you juice it otherwise you won't be able to zest it and some juice and then one lemon also the zest and the juice mmm love the spice of lemon and then the juice okay wanted a little bit sweet but not too sweet have a cup of sugar a little bit of cinnamon not too much because it can really overpower it a little bit of nutmeg because I love him and then clean hands just toss it all together mmm it's like apple pie without the crust and you know I'll do anything not to make a crust okay into a bowl for baking I just want it piled really high okay and you want to get all the juices in cuz that's all gonna bake into the apples mm-hmm that looks good okay so I'm going to clear the decks and then make the topping [Music] so for the topping I want to have lots of flavor and lots of crunch so this what I'm going to do take 1/2 cups of flour it's recorded with a cup of granulated sugar through Crow's a cup of brown sugar I think is it a really good flavor half a teaspoon of salt a cup of oatmeal I use really good you're Irish quick cooking oats whatever you have around is fine this is what gives it all its flavor half a pound of butter two sticks of butter diced and into the mixer okay turn the mixer on until it's all mixed I'm really looking for the butter and the flour and the oatmeal to be crumbly together this is good right now you can do this with your hands but it'll take much longer so I'm just gonna put it right on top it's gonna be really good together especially with homemade vanilla ice cream I know some people like chocolate and some people like cakes but me I like fruit crisps and this is my favorite one apple crisp it's gonna bake for 350 degrees for about an hour and it's gonna make the house smell wonderful and we're gonna have a fabulous dessert [Music] that looks like roast duck whoo I'm just gonna cover it with foil for about 20 minutes let them rest at room temperature and it completes all the juices back into the knee I can't wait for dinner [Music] there's my dinner tonight has all local ingredients I thought why not use hydrangea since they're so typical for the Hamptons okay great a lot of people are confused about the color of hydrangeas most of them either turn blue or pink depending on how alkaline the soil is mine are actually wide they're called sister Teresa they start at this lime green which I particularly love they turn white and then in the fall they become pink and blue I love them all so I'm gonna do an assortment for the table I think that'd be great for dinner I'm gonna do a very earthy table setting but it's gonna be both French and American the first thing is hydrangeas hydrangeas are best if they're put in really hot tap water so I put my little bosses with tap water I'm just going to put one or two hydrangeas into each one so I've all these pink and green ones and since nature isn't perfect I wouldn't have one wacky want so it's going to be white it's very American to use kitchen towels for dinner napkins I thought it a nice twist would be to use antique French kitchen towels what's great is for the messy meal like duck you get a really big napkin I love the contrasts of antique French silver against an old American wooden table I'm gonna use simple American restaurant plates and very elegant Parisian water glasses and my favorite wine glasses I never really feel like I'm having a party until the table settings done so I'd say I'm ready this is my all-time favorite time of the year in East Hampton when the corn is good late summer early fall it's just this is actually particularly gorgeous it's white corn usually it's served boiled right on the cob but I'm going to show you how to make it really special just take your knife and run it down the sides and I'm gonna saute it and a little bit of butter salt and pepper and it's so delicious you just won't believe it it's the easiest recipe and I could just eat that for dinner now you'll see how easy this is so I'm just gonna heat a little butter usually for six people I use eight to ten years of corn you'd be surprised how fast it goes I love these four ingredient recipes corn butter salt and pepper okay that's melted and just throw in the corn lots of salt and pepper let's just go saute for about 5 to 10 minutes until it's just tender and it'll be really delicious can't wait now that looks great they've rested and they're ready to go they look so juicy so what I want to do is quarter the duck the first thing I'm going to do is cut down to both sides of the breastbone and then take it out just like that so once that's out you just pull it apart and you can see the backbone and just cut down both sides so you can remove it so make it so much easier to cut in quarters and then you just take that backbone out just like that okay now that I've got it in half I can cut it into quarters really easily if this looks like a really messy job it is okay that's one [Music] [Music] it may be a bit of a struggle for you but it will make it much easier for your dinner guests so it's worth it this looks great [Music] if I can't believe you brought all these Tomatoes they're gorgeous I think some you agree knows these are yeah yeah they call the early girl boy yeah I'll stand them in you cut them right so how about if I put some some of these orange ones on top great like that good okay so she put olive oil on it right you don't need too much olive oil either the question you know the salt will draw those the moisture out of the tomatoes and then you'll have your own sauce oh that's fantastic okay I've got sauteed corn are you staying for dinner Oh roast duck and corn and you have tomatoes I think so let's go okay everybody dinner served or as I say didn't a city doctor it's actually easier than you think you actually boil it for 45 minutes and then you take it out need a roast in a really high temperature like 500 degrees and it makes the skin really crisp and them and I get rid of all the fats it's like a racing dessert Oh an American dessert is apple crisp and homemade vanilla ice cream does that sound right okay great wait until they taste this apple crisp [Music] it smells great [Music] I'm so glad you're enjoying it next time you come I'll make you a clambake yes okay good Cheers on the beach exactly with sand tomorrow morning [Laughter] [Music]
you I'm going to the movies with friends tonight we're coming home for dinner afterwards I'm not about to start cooking that so I'm gonna have everything done in the fridge and all I have to do is heat it up when we get home penny with five cheese's is one of my favorite things to make for a party it actually comes from friends of mine who own a fabulous restaurant in Providence Rhode Island called Al Forno you won't believe how easy it is to make so the first thing I'm going to do is grate some fontina for dinner tonight we're going to start with an antipasto and then have a salad with balsamic onions and this pinning with five cheese's it's so delicious and it's really easy okay that's the grated fontina so I'm going to make the sauce now let's start with two cups of cream a cup of tomatoes that are actually crushed in tomato juice and then we're going to add all kinds of cheeses cap a cup of pecorino which is like Parmesan but it's really stronger and has lots of flavor half a cup of the fontina which I graded and this is the good stuff this is gorgonzola it's Mountain gorgonzola and it's got lots of flavor and it's creamy and it's gonna really be good in the pasta this a wonderful dish because it's really a great way to use up leftovers if you have chicken just put it in if you have salmon leftover just chuck it in and it all tastes wonderful together two tablespoons of ricotta and a little bit of fresh mozzarella maybe about a quarter of a pound this is good homemade mozzarella you can use buffalo mozzarella which is really soft and delicious just be sure it's good mozzarella this is looking good and fresh basil leaves this just gives it a really good flavor and sort of add something fresh to it which I love so that's everything for the sauce and now I'm just going to add the pasta I've cooked a pound of penne Rigate penne Rigate actually got it's this shape and its got ridges on it really holds the sauce well I cooked it for about four minutes which is not long enough to cook it it's very al dente but it's gonna cook more when I bake the pasta just gonna dump this whole thing in toss it all together this actually doesn't even require salt or pepper because the pasta is really well salted in the water that I boiled it in and the cheese is like the Romano and the gorgonzola they have a lot of salt in them so I'm going to fill these dishes individual gratin dishes for the pasta and then each person will get their own serving of pasta and when it's baked this way I just find that it's really creamy inside and crusty and browned on the top it's a great combination then we're just gonna take a little bit of butter and dot it on the top so the Tuck gets really nicely browned that's it this is gonna go in a really hot oven 500 degrees for about 7 to 10 minutes and it's gonna be brown and crusty on the top and just delicious roasted some cashews just for about 10 minutes until they get a little crisp great but you can't make rosemary caches without rosemary every year I plant rosemary it's a really stronger but sometimes it's just the right note for rosemary roasted potatoes or as marinate the lamb it's perfect and in the winter when I want to save the flavor a stupid Nala Voyles so I have the rosemary olive oil all winter but for now rosemary cashews love the way it smells this recipe actually originally came from Union Square cafe it's their bar nuts they do it with mixed nuts but I love to do it just with cashews but you can do it any way Mike so I'm going to make this mixture with lots of fresh rosemary and then I want to put the hot cashews into it and it will absorb all that fabulous flavor okay so two tablespoons of fresh rosemary chopped up then I'm gonna make it a little sweeter by having two teaspoons of brown sugar tablespoon of kosher salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it real spice the last ingredient is tablespoon of melted butter just toss this all together and then we're gonna add the hot nuts and it's gonna be sorb all the flavor it's me so good we're gonna have these with a really old-fashioned cocktail called sidecars its klein yak Cointreau and lemon juice how bad can that be okay then hi cashews that a pound and a quarter of hot roasted cashews I'm just gonna mix these together until the cashes absorb all that flavor little brown sugar salt cayenne pepper mmm and we have rosemary roasted cashews penny with five cheese's smells like it's ready and it is that's great she's gonna let it cool a little bit and then I'm gonna heat it up after the movies yeah I'm going to the movies with some friends tonight and I've invited them home for dinner afterwards so I want everything done in advance for dessert I'm making stewed fruit with ice cream I'm gonna cook the fruit now and then I'm gonna heat it up a little bit later and serve it over ice cream be really good so the first thing in my stewed fruit is pineapple but it's not just any pineapple it's something called golden pineapple and you really find it in the grocery store now and it's so much sweeter you can just smell it's really sweet and juicy oops just like that and into the saucepan a slippery I'm going to take two half pints of blueberries and put them in and two half pints of raspberries so far so good one and a half cups of sugar it's going to make a little syrup so that the juices and the fruit and the sugar all mixed together and 3/4 of a cup of water I'm going to bring it all up to a simmer over medium heat and then cook it for about five to seven minutes and to all the fruit gets really tender and the juices all combined it's going to be really good with ice cream and while that's cooking I'm gonna get the table ready having a dinner party I was trying to create a really intimate setting so people can really connect with each other I mean these are my friends I really want to spend time with them so I do lots of things to make that happen the first one is and I've talked about this a lot that having a really small table so everybody sort of elbow-to-elbow I think it creates a better dinner party the next thing I love to do is serve family style and I'm gonna do a huge end of pasta right in this plate in the middle of the table everybody counts themselves they can help each other it really makes a shared experience for everybody I love that feeling last thing I love to do is serve dinner in the kitchen there's something about the pasta coming out of the oven and the berries being warmed and it's all part of the experience I never have to leave the party and I think it really keeps it as a cohesive whole makes a much better party and everything's ready for dinner after the movies wine for dinner parties perfectly lovely but kind of boring I think anything in a martini glass makes a party so I'm gonna make an old-fashioned drink sidecars and serve them in martini glasses so the first thing I want to do is make a rim with lemon juice and sugar and it'll be really delicious for the drink so I'm gonna put lemon juice in the first dish and sugar in the second just plain grandma and sugar I'm take both glasses dip it in lemon juice and then dip it in sugar that makes a great rim I just think it makes the drinks with a little more festive okay now I'm going to make the drinks so the first thing I need is cup of cognac a whole cup of Chania that feels like a party already half a cup of triple sec a quarter cup of fresh lemon juice so that's sidecars that's the whole thing I'm just gonna shake it up with some ice and I think I might have to try one myself port of the shaker check it out let's try this guy we can't have an old-fashioned sidecar without maraschino cherry right right Cheers that's gonna be a good party there are only two more things to do for the stood for first one is another half pint of raspberries really to give a great texture I'm going to turn off the heat for this and to give it real punch two tablespoons of friend Waze which is raspberry brandy mmm that's gonna be good so I'm just gonna chill this and later we're gonna reheat it and serve it warm over ice cream and they all melt together it's just delicious in the meantime I'm going to my favorite Italian store to buy ingredients from I into pasta hi Bryan oh shit good I want everything so I'm doing it on defrost oh I need some salon is what do you recommend sopressata however sopressata that's great and maybe a hard salami how about the supper sided slice really thin the hard salami slice thick okay let's do something sweet right yeah that'd be great that's gonna be really good great perfect I saw some gorgeous looking artichokes there I think I'll have to have Monsanto pasta I love the ones who stands about how many doing um maybe about six or seven I'd love some roasted peppers I've got since ice container yeah that'd be great I'm gonna do them with basil and I think I'm gonna serve them with your focaccia they were great they've rosemary yeah we bake them every day I was wonderful anything else and olives what are these black ones those are the guy Etta's Hey look I love a taste okay sure thanks there's so many thank you oh so delicious they're the Grateful flavor and not too salty that's what I'd like okay when you go to a store the only way to know whether you're gonna like the ingredient is taste it people really expect it so this Taleggio looks delicious can I have a little taste sure that's great Colette has a soft ripening cheese so it's good idea to know exactly where it is in that stage here you go oh thank you that's a big taste perfect wonderful I'll take a piece okay okay I think that's it okay thank you so much you see you again soon great day bye friend bye bye so for my peppers with basil these are the peppers that I got at the Italian store but you can also buy them in the grocery store these have pesto in them but even plain ones are just fine and then to give them lots of flavor and add two tablespoons of olive oil tablespoon of balsamic vinegar just like making a vinaigrette capers to give them a little spiciness salt and pepper kind of have salt and pepper stir that up and the last thing is lots of fresh basil I love the flavor of base on it give a really nice fresh flavor to this just gonna stack them all up roll them up do a nice julienne and that's it it's gonna let the sit at room temperature and it's gonna be delicious with the antipasto so with penne and five cheese's how that'll be delicious to have a salad with balsamic onions so I've got lots of red onions I think red onions work for this really well because they're sort of sweeter than yellow onions lots of flavor and I'm gonna roast them so all the busts on like vinegar really gets into the onions it's really good I'm going to combine a quarter of a cup of olive oil quarter of a cup of balsamic vinegar and just pour it right over the onions salt and pepper and then clean hands toss it all together I'm gonna roast these at 375 for about 15 minutes and then splash them when they're hot with a little more balsamic vinegar and when they're cool like a nice red leaf salad with vinaigrette and they're going to be really good my friends are coming for dinner after the movies and I want to be sure everything is done before I go then make a red leaf lettuce salad with balsamic onions and it's gonna be great with a penne with five cheese's so imma show you how to make a vinaigrette I've got two chopped shallots two teaspoons of Dijon mustard quarter of a cup of red wine vinegar salt and pepper so those are really all the flavorings at the bottom of the bowl and then I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of olive oil and just whisk these together and then add the oil slowly sort of I can if you man is the Dijon mustard will mull safai the olive oil so it'll all stay together that's perfect the trick to making a salad in advance is I'm gonna put the vinaigrette on the bottom of the bowl I'm going to take all the lettuce and just put it on top do these gorgeous balsamic onions on top of that vinegar and the onions is really great great together I'm just gonna leave it exactly like that and then just before I serve it I'm going to toss it all together and should be delicious with a pasta so into the fridge until dinner so the last thing to do for my party is assemble the antipasto and this is really about pulling together your favorite two telling ingredients it can be anything you like so I want to do fresh mozzarella the kids are doing a beautiful platter has have big blocks of color the tomatoes are red that mozzarella is white really interesting colors drizzle the mozzarella with some olive oil a little cracked pepper okay the next thing is focaccia miss an Italian bread I'm just going to put it right here facing panel so the next is the roasted peppers that I made with basil and gorgeous capers and people can help themselves with the focaccia so good what's next okay I have salami x' which are really gorgeous I'm going to do julienne pieces of Genoa right there next to the mozzarella some olives have nice big green Sicilian olives with some black olives and I have some nice spicy salami with lots of pepper roll it up and put it in between this looks really good and then because every platter really needs something green it really sets it apart I'm gonna have a big bunch of basil leaves just tear them off and put them right in the middle and it's done brave enough to pass doc patter into the fridge so I've got everything in the fridge for dinner sidecars drinks onto pasta the pasta with five cheese's salad with balsamic vinaigrette and for dessert stewed fruit with ice cream it's in the fridge and I'm going the movies hi guys everybody else in everybody else is all right candy anyone and we're having dinner afterwards I'm going to the movies with friends tonight we're coming home for dinner afterwards I'm not about to start cooking them so I'm gonna have everything done in the fridge and all I have to do is heat it up when we get home penny with five cheese's is one of my favorite things to make for a party it actually comes from friends of mine who want a fabulous restaurant in Providence Rhode Island called Al Forno you won't believe how easy it is to make so the first thing I'm going to do is grate some fontina for dinner tonight we're gonna start with an at de pasto and then have a salad with balsamic onions and this penne with five cheese's it's so delicious and it's really easy okay that's the

ridges on it really holds the sauce well I cooked it for about four minutes which is not long enough to cook it it's very al dente but it's gonna cook more when I bake the pasta just gonna dump this whole thing in toss it all together
[Music] my friends are coming for breakfast I love to do breakfast because it's not the traditional Saturday night dinner which is such a major deal most of the things I've done the night before which is great but the main centerpiece of the meal is a potato basil for Tata so in the pan here I've cooked about two cups of boiling potatoes they're the firm round ones rather than the baking potatoes and I peeled them and just cooking a little butter for about ten or fifteen minutes until they're really just tender and browned and that should be perfect right now now I'm going to make the basis of it which is this gorgeous omelette all mixed together I'm going to start with the second element eight eggs and I actually find that you can use whatever is left over from dinner if you have chicken and broccoli the night before makes a delicious frittata counting one more we just scramble them a little bit and I'm going to add lots of great flavorings but 15 ounces ricotta which is one whole small container and then 3/4 of a pound of green cheese careers it's wonderful like Swiss cheese I know it's eggs cheese and butter it's delicious how bad can that be and then a little bit of butter the last major food group I'm not suggesting to you this every day but once in a while for a treat it's wonderful and then basil I think Bayes was just such a great flavoring so we'll just take the leaves off the stem and chop them very roughly I love the smell of fresh basil and then the last two ingredients our third of a cup of flour to give a little substance and 3/4 a teaspoon of baking powder to make it rise just stir this all together make sure it's nicely blended Jesus and the basil and eggs and that's it I'm just going to pour this right over the potato and then this whole thing goes in the oven from sending individual almost for everybody I have one big omelet world and share it so it goes in the oven at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes to an hour this can be puffed and golden and delicious just is your old still hungry oh I have a potato basil for tau tau I've listed this - its potatoes and basil Italy air and ricotta ricotta your what always always we are here thank you I think that one for this is an idea of a great way to start the day breakfast with my friends
[Music] so I think I'm going to make Krypton spirit which is like a French ham and cheese sandwich so the first thing I need to do is make a roux which is a white sauce I need two tables from the butter not that three tablespoons of flour and you just dump the flour into all at once cook it over low heat just for about a minute or two until the flour is a little bit cooked white sauce is a really convenient thing to know how to make it's great for thickening things like chicken pot pie it's great in grams now what I'm going to do is add two cups of scalded milk it's nice if it's just a little boiling point and just cook that until it thickens to stir it the whole time so it doesn't burn okay so just a little bit boiling point so now I'm going to add teaspoon salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper and a pinch of nutmeg it's classic and white sauce 1/2 a cup of Parmesan cheese and half a cup of grated Gruyere and it's all just going to melt together in the sauce so it's really nice cheese soft lots of flavor because the parmesan grier taste very different it gives a real depth of flavor it looks good ok now I'm going to assemble them so what I've done is I toasted the bread taking off the crust and I bake them at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes turn them to baking another two minutes and they're ready to go now what I'm going to do is put a little mustard on one side cryptids here the classic French lunch and any good cafe in France has croque monsieur or crook madam which has it's exactly the same thing with the fried egg on top so get it thinly sliced a really good either big Virginia ham or a black forest ham something like that and then sprinkle some three around on top the other slice on top of that a [Music] little bit of the cheese on really cheesy or gray on top so the bakery is at 400 degrees for five minutes and then I'm going to broil them for three to five minutes would be nice and brown and crusty on the top [Music] have some the boiler and it was bad dizzy lunch is ready this is my idea of what a business meeting should be having a tough mature which is a French ham and cheese sandwich isn't a scences I hope it does hmm
[Music] I live in East Hampton New York and one of the local treasures is the Sampson Historical Society they oversee five separate museums some of which take back to 1640 which in the United States is really old by friends Frank no bald Valerie Smith and I decided to do a lunch to celebrate the staff and volunteers I hope they love it so I'm grilling some swordfish which is going to be served with a very flavorful tomato caper basil sauce plus zucchini couscous that's flavored with saffron and cumin and for dessert double trouble chocolate pudding with two kinds of chocolate to make the ultimate comfort food really special so while I do the cooking Frank and Valerie is setting the table in one of the historic barns that date back to 1640 right at the end of my street [Music] and love old-fashioned comfort fruit I mean who doesn't and I thought it'd be really nice for the folks at the Historical Society if I made an old-fashioned comfort dessert so I'm going to make chocolate pudding I'm going to start with six egg yolks right into the mixer make sure you get all the good gradients in half a cup of sugar and I'm going to beat this until it's really thick and pale yellow and a ribbon falls back on itself I'll show you what it looks like in the meantime I'm gonna heat some milk two cups of whole milk what I'm gonna do it's like making a custard I'm gonna heat the milk pour it into the egg mixture and then pour it back in stir it for a little while until it's really nice and thick so with era and you'll see there's a long ribbon that falls right back on itself so now I'm going to add some more things cornstarch to make it nice and thick I need a quarter of a cup of cornstarch three tablespoons of ground sweet chocolate he's really good chocolate because it makes a huge difference and then I'm going to add more chocolate later and a pinch of salt because even baked goods need salt and just mix those together on low speed in a cloud of chocolate and then we've checking feed the milks ready and it's perfect and I'm going to pour it very slowly into this mixture just like making a custard [Music] now I'm going to pour the chocolate mixture back into the pan and just cook it for a few minutes it gets really thick put right back in looks pretty child butter you're ready but it's going to get even more when I melt chocolate into it so I'm going to cook it and I'm going to add chocolate and vanilla okay very low heat it's one of those things that you really just have to keep stirring if you leave it you know you'll have chocolate scrambled eggs move I 5 people coming for lunch their staff and volunteers and they do an incredible job keeping Easthampton historically beautiful place so I just thought it'd be nice to see my dear friend Frank new bald has volunteered to organize this full thing and to open the store at Mulford barn for us to and my friend Valerie has agreed to raid her store and do a gorgeous table setting and she always does the farmer who built it was so proud of his barn he put the date in it 1721 carved right in the team Frank Valerie and I are great team I'm sure it's gonna be a great party okay just as this starts to come together it starts to come together a little too much so you just switch to a whisk and just whisk it and turn the heat off and you'll see it's really nice and thick and gorgeous but it still needs more flavor so I'm going to add a few other things more chocolate soy bittersweet chocolate just about 1 ounce I'm just going to chop it up and it'll just melt into the chocolate pudding one ounce of chocolate two tablespoons of butter unsalted butter right and one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla and just a dash of heavy cream 2 tablespoons can't have dessert without a little bit of richness and just stir those in see that wasn't much more effort than making instant pudding mix wasn't and believe me it tastes so much better now all I have to do is put it in dishes this can go into any kind of dish because I'm not baking it but these little ramekins are perfect and I'm going to pour the mixture into a measuring cup because it's so much easier to pour into ramekins from that does that look like good thick chocolate pudding oh my god this makes exactly six we need five for the launch boom I wonder what's going to happen with six I'm just going to cover the top with plastic wrap and let this chill I'm going to most delicious chocolate pudding for dessert next I'm going to make zucchini couscous it's gonna be really good [Music] so the next thing I'll make for the lunch is zucchini couscous for two reasons one is the easiest thing in the world to make and the second is it's best eaten at room temperature so it'll be perfect for the party in the barn so first I'm gonna make a flavored broth with chicken stock that's going to flavor the couscous one and a half cups with good chicken stock if you have homemade chicken stock it really makes a difference but if not good canned chicken stock from the grocery store is fine and then I'm going to flavor it with 1 teaspoon of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper quarter of a teaspoon of cumin sort of Moroccan spices since couscous is most usually associated with Morocco half a teaspoon of saffron triad or if these red filaments it's incredibly expensive but it's really worth it a little bit goes a long way and what they are as stamens of crocuses particular kind of crocus it's very spicy and sweet at the same time and then two tablespoons of butter it's really like making pasta a little bit of butter to make it stick and have lots of flavor I'm just going to heat this right up sometimes couscous is a main course usually with lamb lots of vegetables but today I'm going to make it as a side dish with zucchini it's gonna be wonderful with a swordfish mmm it's just boiling now so we'll turn off the heat and just let it steep for about 15 minutes you can smell the chicken stock and cumin and the spicy saffron it's gonna be really good I wonder have Valerie and Frank are doing so I better get going setting up for our lunch today [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm just going to saute some zucchini so two zucchini good news about zucchini is you can get it all year round and it's just delicious just tap it up roughly in the summer I like to use tomatoes and zucchini and the winter I use roasted butternut squash whatever is good so just dice the zucchini roughly and sometimes even leftover vegetables are great for this so I want to heat up a few tablespoons of olive oil I just want the zucchini cooked remember it's not going to cook once it's in this couscous all it's going to do is steep in the stock until it's a little browned on the outside and cook through and one more zucchini this is salted a little bit this is definitely the category is you salt it as you go along it takes perfectly seasoned as yourself is at the end it just tastes salty just cook it for about five minutes until it's sort of browned on the outside and it's fully cooked inside so it's tender zucchini kind of has a chocolate flavor but it's not cooked not good put right on top the couscous with a stock over it look how gorgeous that stock looks you can really see the saffron and smell cumin I'm just mix it all together and you'll see I'm going to cover it with plastic wrap and it's going to get puffed and gorgeous and be ready whenever I want to serve it it's gonna steep for about 15 minutes and meanwhile when we chop us with fresh herbs the zucchini and basil look great together so I very often use them so just some fresh basil II just take them right off the stem mmm that smells good okay just shut these guys up make sure the leaves are really dry so they don't turn brown and then fresh parsley no parsley is definitely an underrated herb very often it's used as a garnish I can't figure out why but it's really delicious and so just take your knife and run along with stems we're gonna put a lot in at a really season it's very peppery I find flat leaf parsley a little more flavor than curly parsley so when I'm using it as an ingredient I try and find flat leaf but if all you have is curly it's just fine okay now into the couscous so this is the steamed couscous all the liquids been absorbed all the flavours gotten into it I'm just going to add all this parsley and basil what's the trick with couscous you want to fluff it with a fork amazing how it puffs up and it makes a lot of couscous zucchini couscous gonna be so good with the swordfish with tomatoes and capers and I'm gonna make next next thing I want to make for the Historical Society it's actually one of my longest standing dishes it's swordfish with tomatoes and basil and capers the first thing I'm going to do is make the sauce one of the reasons why this is a great dish that used to do it for catering all the time is because you can make the sauce in advance and just grill the swordfish and then the whole thing served at room temperature so whenever you're ready to serve dinner it's ready in this case lunch so the first thing I'm to do is a few tablespoons of olive oil that a cup of chopped fennel and about a cup of chopped onions yellow onion that'll actually had sort of an anise flavor but it gets very sweet when it's cooked and I like it that way okay so about a teaspoon of chopped garlic I was put the garlic in last because you don't want it to burn and just stir it around cook it for about ten minutes maybe a little more oil you can always add a little bit of water if it's starting to burn medium low heat and just let that get really sweet and caramelized the meantime I'm going to work on the tomatoes so you can use fresh tomatoes but it's so easy to use canned tomatoes if you find a good quality one they're really delicious they've plum tomatoes and they're already peeled already which is really a benefit and I'm just going to drain them a little bit okay that's done some scoop for this is with a sauteed onions and fennel tea spoon of salt 3/4 a teaspoon of pepper and to stir it all together so this is just going to simmer for about 15 minutes and later I'm gonna add some wine and some stock and make a gorgeous sauce out of it I know salary has great style I'm sure she's doing something gorgeous for the tables in the barn a little more flavor for the sauce the swordfish and tomatoes and capers can add a little bit of wine that two tablespoons two tablespoons of chicken stock and just turn up the heat and just let the liquid reduce a little bit maybe about ten minutes and then when that's done I'm going to add a little bit of butter capers and basil hello gorgeous sauce the grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers [Music] there we go I just hope this all lives up to the wonders of Ines food the last three things I want to add to this sauce for the swordfish are capers fresh basil and a little bit of butter first thing I do is drain the capers capers are great flavor of tomato sauce can just be too sweet because the tomatoes are sweet you want a little something vinegary so two tablespoons of capers right into the sauce about a 1/2 a cup of chopped basil you need a chop it or julienne it which is long thin strips I think maybe I'll julienne it there's a lot of flavors going on in this sauce tomatoes fennel onions garlic capers fresh basil so just stack the leaves up neatly roll them up like in a cigar and then just do thin strips of it that's about a half a cup and just put right in and then just add a little bit of richness right at the end I'm going to put in a tablespoon of butter and that's the sauce for grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers you know it's really just a good basic tomato sauce and I can imagine maybe with a little tomato paste putting it on pasta or serve it with any kind of fish that has enough flavor to stand up to it which the swordfish really does I'm just going to simmer that for a minute and then just turn it off and it's ready whenever I want to serve it then I'm going to grill the swordfish I think I'll grill it inside you can do it outside too but I'll show you know doing inside and then serve it later the party atmosphere farm feel be perfect [Music] grilled swordfish for swordfish with tomatoes and capers I love swordfish I had the fish store cut these about 1 inch thick I'm just going to brush it with a little bit of olive oil it'll make a nice sear for it salt want to make sure you see isn't it really well pepper and we put them on a grill pan I've left it on high heat really high heat for about 3 to 4 minutes until it got really hot it's just you can see it's just starting to smoke I'm just going to put the fish we want to put it on and just leave it otherwise you want to end up with grill marks if you keep moving it around excuse me side down then cook for about three minutes the meantime I'm going to oil the other side more salt and pepper you know we stood this on the charcoal grill so it's delicious little pepper I'm just going to let that cook on the grill for about three or four minutes while I get everything else ready for Frank time to turn the swordfish Oh perfect how great that look sometimes a you can surprise myself so the sauce is ready sit right in the bottom of the platter I just put the swordfish right on top of the stall or just this book I say these are going to be very happy people at the Historical Society and it's going to be great room temperature that's absolutely perfect they'd be fresh basil on top

thing I'll make for the lunch is zucchini couscous for two reasons one it's the easiest thing in the world to make and the second is it's best eaten at room temperature so it'll be perfect for the party in the barn so first I make a flavored broth with chicken stock that's going to flavor the couscous one and a half cups of good chicken stock if you have homemade chicken stock it really makes a difference but if not good canned chicken stock from the grocery store is fine and then I'm going to flavor it with one teaspoon of salt just some fresh basil II just take them right off the stem that's Mel's good okay just shut these guys up make sure the leaves are really dry so they don't turn brown and then fresh parsley no parcel is definitely an underrated herb very often it's used as a garnish I can't figure out why but it's really delicious and so just take your knife and run along with stems we're gonna put a lot in and a really season it's very peppery I fight flat leaf parsley a little more flavor than curly parsley so when I'm using it as an ingredient I try and find flat leaf but if all you have is curly it's just fine okay now into the couscous so this is the steamed couscous all the liquids been absorbed all the flavors gotten into it I'm just going to add all this parsley and basil missed the trick with couscous you want to fluff it with a fork it's amazing how it puffs up and it makes a lot of couscous zucchini and couscous gonna be so good with the swordfish with tomatoes and capers and I'm gonna make next [Music] can't have dessert without a little bit of richness and just stir those in see that wasn't much more effort than making instant pudding mix wasn't and believe me it tastes so much better now all I have to do is put it in dishes this can go into any kind of dish because I'm not baking it but these little ramekins are perfect and I'm going to pour the mixture into a measuring cup because it's so much easier to pour into ramekins from that does that look like good thick chocolate pudding oh my god this makes exactly six we need five for the lunch boom I wonder what's going to happen this I'm just going to cover the top with plastic wrap and let this chill I'm going to most delicious chocolate pudding for dessert next I'm going to make zucchini couscous to be really good [Music] so the next thing I'll make for the lunch is zucchini couscous for two reasons one it's the easiest thing in the world to make and the second is it's best eaten at room temperature so it'll be perfect for the party in the barn so first I'm gonna make a flavored broth with chicken stock that's going to flavor the couscous one and a half cups of good chicken stock if you have homemade chicken stock it really makes a difference but it's not good canned chicken stock from the grocery store is fine and then I'm going to flavor it with one teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper quarter of a teaspoon of cumin sort of Moroccan spices since couscous is most usually associated with Morocco half a teaspoon of saffron which I adore if these red filaments it's incredibly expensive but it's really worth it a little bit goes a long way and what they are as stamens of crocuses particular kind of crocus it's very spicy and sweet at the same time and then two tablespoons of butter it's really like making pasta and a little bit of butter to make it stick and have lots of flavor I'm just going to heat this right up sometimes couscous is a main course usually with lamb lots of vegetables but today I'm going to make it as a side dish with zucchini it's gonna be wonderful with a swordfish mmm it's just boiling now so we'll turn off the heat and just let it steep for about 15 minutes you can smell the chicken stock of the cumin and the spicy saffron it's gonna be really good I wonder have Valerie and Frank are doing so I better get going setting up for our lunch today I'm just going to saute some zucchini so two zucchini good news about zucchini is you can get it all year round and it's just delicious just tap it up roughly in the summer I like to use tomatoes and zucchini and the winter I use roasted butternut squash whatever is good so just dice the zucchini roughly and sometimes even leftover vegetables are great for this so I want to heat up a few tablespoons of olive oil I just want the zucchini cooked remember it's not going to cook once it's in this couscous all it's going to do is steep in the stock until it's a little browned on the outside and cook through and one more zucchini let's go assault it a little bit this is definitely the category if you salt it as you go along it takes perfectly seasoned if you salted at the end it just tastes salty just cook it for about five minutes until it's sort of browned on the outside and it's fully cooked inside so it's tender zucchini kind of has a chalky flavor it's not cooked not good but right on top the couscous with a stock over it look how gorgeous that stock looks you can really see the saffron and smell cumin I'm just mix it all together and you'll see I'm going to cover it with plastic wrap and it's going to get puffed and gorgeous and it be ready whenever I want to serve it that's gonna state for about 15 minutes and meanwhile I'm gonna chop up some fresh herbs the zucchini and basil look great together so I very often and then just do thin strips of it that's about a half a cup and just put right in and then just add a little bit of richness right at the end I'm going to put in a tablespoon of butter and that's the sauce for grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers you know it's really just a good basic tomato sauce and I can imagine maybe with a little tomato paste putting it on pasta or serve it with any kind of fish that has enough flavor to stand up to it which the swordfish really does I'm just going to simmer that for a minute and then just turn it off it's ready whenever I want a server then I'm going to grill the swordfish I think I'll grill it inside you can do it outside too but I'll show you how to do it inside and then serve it later the party at Mulford farm you look perfect [Music] grilled swordfish with swordfish with tomatoes and capers I love swordfish I had the fish store cut these about 1 inch thick I'm just going to brush it with a little bit of olive oil it'll make a nice sear for it salt want to make sure you season it really well pepper and we put them on a grill pan I've left it on high heat really high heat for about three to four minutes until it got really hot it's just you can see it's just starting to smoke I'm just going to put the fish we want to put it on and just leave it otherwise you want to end up with grill marks if you keep moving it around seasoning side down then cook for about three minutes the meantime I'm going to oil the other side more salt and pepper you know we stood this on the charcoal grill - it's delicious little pepper I'm just going to let that cook on the grill for about three or four minutes while I get everything else ready for Frank time to turn the swordfish Oh perfect how great that look because they used to surprise myself so the sauce is ready put it right in the bottom of the platter [Music] I'm just put the swordfish right on top of the stall gorgeous this looks I say these are going to be very happy people at the Historical Society and it's going to be great room temperature it's absolutely perfect it would be fresh basil on top actually I even prefer a big bunch of fresh basil so it says this is swordfish with tomatoes and basil and capers oh hi hi oh you're so good to do oh this is so kind of you this is fantasy so it's a couscous and chocolate pudding and a grilled swordfish underneath oh how fabulous that's so kind of you to do this they're gonna appreciate this so much we like appreciated okay thank you bye [Music] whatever it is someone saw me in the cell that makes it different Cheers

pudding in a spoon [Music] and it's so chocolatey and put the swordfish right on top of the stall gorgeous this book I say these are going to be very happy people at the Historical Society and it's going to be great room temperature it's absolutely perfect you may be fresh basil on top actually I even prefer a big bunch of fresh basil so it says this is swordfish with tomatoes and basil and capers oh hi
in Paris I take inspiration everywhere when I come to the boulevard rest by market I love to see these rotisserie chickens going around and all those gorgeous juices falling on the potatoes so that was fabulous and when I went home I thought wouldn't it be great to have bread cubes underneath and that's how roast chicken with croutons was born it's so delicious chicken with croutons work for a crown or simple lunch like today when my friend on ER shows up and I'm gonna stuff the inside with lemon just put them right inside it's kind of really good flavor salt pepper and into the pan great so I'm going to roast at 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes until it's just perfectly done and then I'm going to saute bread croutons and when the chicken is roasted I'm going to slice it over the croutons so it just absorbs all that gorgeous chicken juice and the flavors so for the croutons I'm going to use a sourdough bread like this you can get them all over the country but it reminds me so much of those wonderful breads from Paul on bakery that I love in Paris this is Paul on it's probably the most famous bread shop in the world they famously huge loaves of sourdough bread and they are so delicious you can buy them in lots of places the United States you could also have them shipped overnight to your door wait to see the bread ovens downstairs they can put 48 of these incredible loaves in at one time nothing close checking to make the house smell good so I'm just gonna cover this with foil that that's all the juices back into the meat mix really moist about 15 minutes which is just enough time to make the croutons so croutons let's go slice the bread and big cubes I think half a loaf is enough for two people and I don't mind it with a crust on if you prefer it without the crust just cut it off but I love the earthy way it looks it's a great way to use up leftover bread just a little film of oil in the pan get it really hot and then just put all the bread cubes in you want them in one layer just saute them medium heat just keep turning them until they're nice and browned on all sides and then when I slice the chicken over the bread cubes on the platter all that gorgeous juice from the chicken and the lemon is gonna get into the cubes it's gonna be really good can really do this with any kind of bread like a baguette or sourdough bread or a big white bread just make sure it's really good bread good to see such a marinated that smells so good okay well it's a French inspired meal so I'm making roast chicken on a bed of croutons and it sounds like shell sounds a little liner twist on a French meal and for any string beans and it's with you in mind here come on okay I left a little glass of wine and some Tartine for you I'm gonna go get the chicken ready I sounds great yeah I'll be right back okay I just love onna I think she's inspired me more than anybody else I know but now I'd get lunch ready serious stuff so I'm just gonna cut this up put it right on top of the croutons and then all the juices from the chicken are going to get into the croutons you can smell all the lemon the chicken juices move for the breasts so I'm going to do is I'm going to cut it all off in one piece and then slice it and that way everybody gets a little bit of the neat and a little bit of the skin I'm just going to put the roasted lemons on the platter to and the beans i blanch for about three minutes and then i have the roasted vegetables put them right on top okay well that's it up I'm going to get the shallots in the bowl we're just around town on the lodge these are they're gonna be so good with the chicken everything's ready for lunch mama lunch is ready please place it right dad yes okay fabulous it'll be fine I hope this is just a beautiful who would like it Oh help yourself this looks so wonderful these little chicken pieces and croutons what a surprise and some caramelized shell oh they look so wonderful yourself I know you feel exactly the same way I do I can't go to Paris Oh that'd be inspired by something food the flowers just the warmth and the style the people and of course the Rhine cheers to powers
I love the combination of strawberries and cream and I thought it'd be really fun to make a cake that had those flavors so I came up with a strawberry country cake it was wonderful through simple white cake and I cut it in half and then I feel it was whipped cream and fresh strawberries I'm going to start with one and a half sticks of butter and two cups of sugar I'm gonna cream these together it's a nice light color it's really fluffy wonderful and now on low speed I'm going to add the eggs I need four eggs I always crack them into a bowl so there's a bad egg I haven't ruined everything I've made I'm going to add these eggs one at a time so next thing I want to add is sour cream so it's 3/4 of a cup of sour cream and that goes in I'm sour creams room-temperature - so it all gets incorporated nicely so first I'm gonna do a little orange zest but I have a teaspoon should do it so that's about a half a teaspoon half a teaspoon of lemon zest that should do it that's going to go into the batter mix those in and a little vanilla these flavors are really subtle because I don't want them to overpower the strawberries and whipped cream after I sell the cake okay I've got all the wet ingredients now I'm going to do the dry ingredients I need two cups of all-purpose flour and quarter of a cup of cornstarch teaspoon of baking soda which is the leavening just going to make it rise and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and then on low speed just add the flour really slowly and then into the pan so when I bake these both now once for the party tonight and what I'm going to freeze and I'll have another party another time but they get 350 degrees for about 45 minutes until a cake cluster comes out clean so now the cakes are nicely cooled and the first thing I want to do is put one of the cakes in the freezer now for our favorite cake the one we're going to have tonight I'm going to cut it in half and fill it with strawberries and whipped cream so I'll show you a chick I'm feeling shaky I'll take two six and just put them halfway through and then I'll cut just above the toothpicks and I know my knife will cut it exactly in half that's not so good now the first thing is we have two whipped cream that a cup of heavy cream and then while that's looking on this flavor is vanilla but it'd have to be soon and some sugar so this is really T okay perfect place a little bit of cream on the cake big thick slices of strawberries place them with a point tipping out the top goes on big dollop a little cream on the time I love about this is sort of a country kind of dessert it's a nice big strawberries on the top I like the way the stems on because it with more strawberry like house [Music]
[Music] so the first thing I want to make for my lunch today as I getting facial is a crunchy noodle salad with lots of Asian spices so I'm going to start with thin pasta actually like thin spaghetti for it seems to absorb the flavor the best to that the bowl okay the next thing is sugar snap pea it's about a pound I'm going to salt the water and then blanch them for about three to five minutes just until they're crisp tender okay first scallions go into the salad and the red peppers the next thing is the sugar snap peas shock them first which means take them out of the boiling water putting them iced water stuff the cooking really sets the color and it stops them from getting overcooked just take the second first just make sure they're really cold and they are right into the salad it's really cold okay now the soft got great flavor okay the first day's cup of vegetable oil don't use olive oil here because I want the other Asian sizes to come out I wanted it clear oil there's no flavor an intense ol quarter of a cup of rice wine vinegar and find this in the Asian section new grocery store third of a cup of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil this isn't a fair one it's the limit the dark one it's got lots of flavor 1 tablespoon of honey give it a little sweetness and 2 cloves of chopped garlic so what's the spoon of grated ginger if you want a higher you can always put more in okay this is the bits that have come of peanut butter that's really what gives it sort of an Indonesian flavor and you want to use smooth peanut butter and then just whisk it all together then you can make the thoughts way in advance and you can make the salad in advance but not too far because actually the soy sauce will break down the noodles I think the less I'm going to put in the sauce is some toasted sesame seeds I toasted them in a dry pan just put about two tablespoons in and save the rest to decorate the salad okay right on the salad so this the warm noodles a spaghetti tin spaghetti and the scallions sugar snap peas rich peppers toss it all together and I can watch this go off on it and some chopped parsley such a rough chop and then some more sesame seeds so it looks like sesame
[Music] my life's gotten so busy that sometimes it's hard to find a day to just test recipes but today's the day I've got some ideas I have two classic recipes that I want to update and a soup I've always loved this is definitely my kind of day first I'm taking my classic strawberry scones and seeing if there are other flavors that would make it even better next a wild mushroom lasagna using local mushrooms and finally a shrimp bisque that's as delicious as the classic one that's so much easier to make this is going to be really fun a couple of classic Barefoot Contessa recipes that I'm always trying to improve on and one of them is scones I'm gonna start with four cups of flour all-purpose flour need two tablespoons of sugar you want them a little sweet but not really sweet two tablespoons of baking powder make them light and fluffy and two teaspoons of salt we have lots of flavor combine that in the mixer okay now I need some butter the key to really light flaky scones is the butter it's really important that it's very cold when the heat of the oven hits the butter and the scones the water evaporates and the steam puffs them up okay into the flour mixture just turn the mixer on low we mix it until the butter isn't like pea-sized pieces okay in the meantime I'm gonna get the eggs and the cream ready so I need four extra-large eggs it's best if they're cold so they don't make the butter warm and my cup of cold heavy cream it's gonna mix the eggs and put them right into the cream so I'm just gonna pour that creaming the eggs right in it's gonna be a really wet dough but the wetter it is the more moist that scones are perfect don't over mix it so I need 3/4 of a cup of dried strawberries the classic is raisins but I barefoot we used to do them with dried strawberries I'm gonna start with that and then see if I can make variations of it if you can't find them you can always use raisins or cranberries some kind of dried fruit is really good okay let's go put this right in okay I'm gonna mix it with a tablespoon of flour so it stays well distributed in the mix okay into the mix now I wouldn't know what else I can add to this I can't tell you how many times I find myself in the pantry looking for inspiration so I want something that would go really well with scones salted peanuts yeah roasted cashews Jeffrey already ate them what else honey I make them too sweet currents already did that one no I think that's too sweet I think walnuts is it Marge that might be good to actually walnuts and oranges that says breakfast right so I'm gonna chop up some walnuts in the bowl maybe some orange zest just do it right on the ball and then I'll flour these and I think I'll make two kinds of scones I'll make the plain strawberry ones and then I'll make the ones with strawberries orange and walnuts then I can see which one I like the best I'd say this is about third of a cup of walnuts and a tablespoon of orange zest I need a little bit of flour maybe a bit another tablespoon I'm gonna roll out half of them playing say getting lots of flour it's really stinky I'm gonna Pat it out that's requires an interesting and I like to use a square cutter and it can really be any size cutter it can be around when it can be square one I like to make triangles out of a big square okay so those are plain ones I'm gonna add bananas and orange zest I can actually see the butter and I can see the car exhaust looks good roll it out to about 3/4 of an inch I think I'll bring into the office and see what everybody here thinks okay that's enough for a test these are the new ones just going to cut these in triangles that's the experimental walnut in orange tray and now for the traditional ones with just strawberry so we can use that as a control test okay I've washed just a little beaten egg white with a little milk or water just makes it nice and brown on the top it's pretty cool if sugar and make it look good [Music] into the oven 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes I think I know which one I'm gonna like best I'm curious which one they like okay Susanna and Shanae I think I like the one with the walnuts better okay I think it's the orange scones with walnuts right okay my next challenge is I'm going to take classic lasagna recipe and make a wild mushroom lasagna what do you think it sounds delicious oh good hey you guys want to come for lunch you that was neckla Sonia with turkey sausage which is perfectly fine but I thought wouldn't it be nice to make it with wild mushrooms and I heard about a wild mushroom farm somewhere around here I think that sounds delicious [Music] look at these mushrooms they're amazing nice shiitake I just he's awful blogs in the back oh they're gorgeous actually I need why don't I have pounds of mushrooms I usually make a turkey lasagna and I want to make it with wild mushrooms well so since you're the wild mushroom man so what are these guys what I have here are some some blue oyster mushrooms named blue for the color but always de mushrooms because of their shape just like a moister okay then what are these guys these are the king of oysters they call him a king because it's kind of the king of the oyster mushrooms got a nice firm texture and nutty flavor and you know and that's calico cream-colored cat are they different in flavor they're gonna be a little more rich a little stronger like nutty flavor almost if mushrooms can be nutty and these will be a little more mild and tender I think that's perfect to do okay great as often thank you these look amazing I can't wait to make the lasagna [Music] I guess so much day my voter by David you doing [Music] well no matter what kind of lasagna I'm testing you have to start out with a lasagna noodles so I have a big pot of boiling water olive oil make sure they don't stick together salt that's three quarters of a pound of lasagna noodles I'm gonna boil them for bet at 8 to 10 minutes just until they're done so the first thing I'm gonna do for the mushroom lasagna is a bechamel or white sauce it's really kind of a classic for lasagna so the first thing is I need butter I would stick of butter just melt that over medium heat and what I've got is I've got a quart of milk that I'm heating up I need to have a cup of flour it's gonna put it right into the butter just dump the whole thing in I'm just gonna cook it for just a bit a minute okay I'm just gonna put the milk in all at once it's gonna make a really thick white sauce just needs some seasonings tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper and nutmeg court of the teaspoon of fresh nutmeg I'm just gonna keep stirring this so just thickened it happened so fast I only want to keep an eye on it its thickens too fast you can just whisk it until it's smooth I'd say that's perfect okay next for the mushrooms big saute pan okay time to slice the mushrooms so I'm gonna do this in two batches cuz you don't want if there are too many mushrooms in the pan without steam instead of saute and they won't have as much flavor so I'm just gonna slice these big slices if you can't find these mushrooms which are hard to find actually cuz they're really special you can use portobello mushrooms or porcini mushrooms or shiitakes are delicious it's amazing how many kinds of varieties there are okay salmon here 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil it'll just help them Brown a little bit just has so much more flavor when they're sauteed into the pan on the cookies for five minutes and then another batch for five minutes nothing written to assembles of lasagna [Music] so the first thing to do is pour some white sauce on the bottom of the dish they're about three or four layers of this when we have put the sauce holds on you noodles and the mushrooms with lots of Parmesan cheese in the middle okay so the next thing is noise on your noodles just fit them in loosely it doesn't have to be perfect they're hot they're really hot and if you have to cut them to fit that's fine okay more sauce doesn't have to bind it all together it's a really elegant kind of lasagna it's great as a main course for a vegetarian but it's also nice if you want to do a roast and a little bit of lasagna to go with it so about a third of the mushrooms and there's a good part Parmesan cheese about a quarter of a cup of Parmesan cheese this is really gonna flavor it okay I'm gonna do it again Willa's Anja [Music] more sauce one of the great things about was on there always is that you can make it in advance and then just bake it before dinner okay more mushrooms more parmesan more lasagna noodles [Music] okay into the oven 375 degrees 45 minutes it smells delicious the proofs can be in the tasting [Music] perfect timing I do it did I notice on you'd show up all right this is the test I mean you know you never know it's a mushroom lasagna how's this is that a big enough taste what do you think get the mushrooms from that wonderful guy in four champion who has mushroom farm oh it smells pretty good actually in every house oh okay go for it [Music] good what's the spice ina okay I'm the worst critic one of the things I've learned when I'm recipe testing is write it down immediately because by tomorrow I've totally forgotten what I've done so I would say the strawberries comes for a success everybody like them including me with orange zest and walnuts so just when I thought something was perfect the way it was it can be even better and the Wang mushroom lasagna that was a surprise I actually really like lasagna with meat in it but the mushrooms are so meaty who needs me it was just wonderful [Music] sure bisque I love it but every recipe I've seen is really complicated I decided I'm gonna see if I can make a really simple version that's just delicious I bought fish stock and I've added the shrimp shells to it to give it even more flavor I'm gonna strain the fish stock I need 3 and 3/4 cups so if I have a little less I'm just gonna have some water yep just a little water okay so first thing I've done here is sauteed two cups of leeks and three tablespoons of olive oil just make sure the links are really really clean before you cook them okay I'm gonna add some garlic but a tablespoon of garlic just saute it for a bit a minute actually love shrimp bisque I like that rich shrimp flavor and a little bit of sherry so the next thing it needs a little bit of cayenne pepper just a pinch not too much you don't want to overpower the shrimp and just cook that together okay and then a pound of shrimp this is where the shells came from and just cook the shrimp for about three minutes until they're just perfectly pink and just tender and the shrimp's cooked I'm gonna add the rest of the ingredients and have a really rich delicious shrimp it [Music] well I can't make good shrimp bisque with that sherry but I've actually decided little cognac would help it too so I'm gonna start with a quarter of a cup of cognac just going to pour it right into the shrimp and leeks better cook from this and that smells good and a quarter of a cup of dry sherry and all that's just going to really get into the shrimp and flavor the soup now that smells like shrimp bisque shrimp and sharing so classic okay I'm gonna puree this now just put it right into the food processor now I'm just gonna puree until it's really chunky and I like it when it's too smooth [Music] [Music] okay that's perfect so now I'm gonna make a white sauce that's gonna be the base with the soup this white sauce is really the same kind of white sauce I made for the lasagna I'm starting with half a stick of butter and a quarter of a cup of flour I'm gonna cook it over medium low heat for about a minute just to cook the flour then I'm adding two cups of half-and-half who's gonna stir this is what heaven 1/2 gets hot and it thickens with the flour so far it's been pretty easy ok the next I'm gonna put in is the pureed shrimp and leeks really smells good I can smell the cognac and sherry that's my have some good flavor the fish stock 3 and 3/4 cups third of a cup of tomato paste 2 teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and that's it let's go stir it up and just let this simmer all the flavors are going to go together it's going to be rich and delicious I hope hmm so good classic taste half the time I'm happy it was a good day [Music]
[Music] tiramisu Lucinda 90s with pasta pesto Wester the 80s it was done done and overdone and we all stopped making it and in fact it's one of those really delicious and easy things to make someone make it today for my husband Jeffrey so I need six egg yolks if you want to really be squishy and messy about this it's the best way to separate eggs it's just do it in your hand and the whites fall right through your fingers and the yolk goes right into the bowl and it's gone I'm going to add a quarter of a cup of sugar and now I'm going to whisk these for about five minutes until they're really light and you'll see they change completely [Music] so while that's going I'm going to put the other ingredients together the first one is I need really good rum dark rum is so wonderful because it's got really great depth of flavor since it's not that so I need a quarter of a cup of dark rum and a quarter of a cup of espresso and then the less ingredient I need is my cell phone and I'll show you what it is it's a really lovely ingredient it's really Italian cream cheese it's very thick at the triple creme and it's so rich in this amazing third position well the X was done so I'll show you this is just the way they want to look it's light and when you hold it up it falls back on itself in a ribbon so now a medium speed I'm just going to add a combination of the espresso and the rum so I can smell the Roman espresso when it hits the eggs it's wonderful I'm just going to add the mascarpone would put it at 16 ounces of mascarpone it's either one large or two small containers so that's the cream mixture and now we're going to go to assembling it this is the secret to making really good tiramisu they're called salvo you already and you get them in the Italian specialty store possibly even the grocery store they're ladyfingers but unlike American ladyfingers they're really crisp they're great on their own and what I'm going to do is dip them in a mixture of rum and coffee and then pour the cream over these T's fantastic the key to the ladyfingers is if you dip them for too long they get very soggy if you dip them for too little time they're going to not absorb enough flavor so we'll just do it like this exactly that amount of time and then put it right into the dish and then the next one on one side on the other side and then lift it out and now I'm going to take this incredible delicious screams this is the mascarpone and eggs and rum and espresso and pour half of it right over the top of this like that and now we're going to do another layer of espresso rum soaked ladyfingers the good news about this is it's not rocket science all I'm doing basically is assembling this and I didn't have to cook a thing there's no standing the government going is it done is it not done and the last layer of cream just smooth it over the top and then just before I serve it I'm going to put shaved chocolate and sometimes a little bit of powdered sugar on the top so it goes in the fridge and it'll sit for about an hour or two but the good news is to consider for two days back in the fridge and desserts already [Music]
my friend Miguel is coming for dinner tonight on his way to Paris and I thought what should we make him for dinner and then I had the idea before Guignol and that way his vacation can start tonight even before he lands in Paris tomorrow so the first thing I'm gonna make is beef bourguignon which is really just beef stew with red wine and I'm gonna serve it with a salad with a creamy mustard vinaigrette and maybe a Kurile which is champagne with a little bit of kir in it mmm sounds good for the beef bourguignon what I have here is about a half a pound of bacon I cooked it in a tablespoon of oil I'm gonna take it out which leaves some of the fat in the pan and then I'm gonna cook the beef and the vegetables and the wine little kind yak it's gonna be really good together you know I think Americans think of French food as this sort of fancy pinkies up kind of thing and I love the really traditional recipes that have real country food so the next thing I'm going to do is take two and a half pounds of Chuck which is a fairly inexpensive cut of meat not like filet of beef and I've cut it in cubes and I'm going to dry it a little bit if the cubes are dry they'll Brown better in the pan just salt pepper and then I'm going to brown them in the pan just do it in a single layer so they Brown really evenly oh this looks great so that meets all nice and brown and it really brings out the flavor so I'm gonna take this and take it out of the pan onto the plate with the bacon and just put it all together want to save all the juices and it's all gonna go back in the pan later okay and then the next thing I'm gonna do is put in the rest of the meat this is a really traditional French recipe and I just think it's a much easier way to make it it takes much less time but it's wonderful for entertaining because you've got the meat and the vegetables and everything all together in the puffs and if you make it a day or two in advance all the flavors just get better and better you just have to heat it up before dinner okay that's done I'm just gonna take this out mm-hmm it smells so good already now I'm just gonna finish prepping the vegetables I have a pound of carrots and now what I'm going to do is throw them into the pot with all the juices from the beef and the bacon and cook them for about 10 or 15 minutes until they're just tender and I'm going to add two large yellow onions and the tablespoon of salt and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper it seems like a lot but it's a big stew I'm just gonna saute this for about 15 minutes until the vegetables are just tender and the onions are nicely browned this is so great Miguel I think is picking up flowers and dessert while I make dinner so it makes it so much easier and really more fun I love a good collaborative meal so the next thing I'm going to do for the beef bourguignon is put in chopped garlic I'm about to close very often recipes call for onions and garlic to go in together but I think the garlic really burns very quickly so I tend to do the onions for about 10 to 15 minutes and then the garlic for only the last minute and then you get all the flavor of the garlic and no burning so two cloves of garlic right in with the carrots and the onions I'm just going to stir that up a minute while I go get the cognac see what I'm trying to do is sort of set up the table the sort of French look and I think you know the topiaries have that sort of sense of French formula garden so I think I would love this very evening okay sure you know what I'm also gonna pick those two one I'll grab the green that's great this is what I like one-stop shopping she loves big bows so that's nice big bow perfect in a clear paper yes that'll be great so I need to have a cup of cognac I'm gonna pour it into the pot and now comes the fun part I'm gonna flame it stand back but the flame does is it burns off all the alcohol that leaves a gorgeous flavor of cognac okay and then I'm going to put all the meat and the bacon and all those gorgeous juices right back in and then a whole bottle of red wine good red wine you want to make sure it's wine that you drink and actually you can even serve the same wine with dinner I did say a whole bottle and then I'm going to add a little bit of beef broth I just want enough so that it covers almost covers me but not quite and don't spend days making beef broth the can of it is just fine tablespoon of tomato paste I actually get it in a tube so it's really easy to keep stored in the refrigerator okay keep it nice and fresh with the top on and the last thing here is fresh herbs fresh thyme mmm smelling awfully good I think Miguel's gonna be pleased so now it's simmering which is perfect now this is the other novel thing about this recipe instead of cooking it on top of the stove as most beef bourguignon is and I'm endlessly fiddling turning up the heat turning down that he I discovered that if I cooked it at 250 degrees in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes instead of like two and a half hours as they usually are it comes out perfectly done so into the oven an hour and 15 minutes at 250 degrees and we're gonna have to beef bourguignon I love how in France they serve salad and cheese after the main course so since we're having a French dinner why not so what I'm gonna do is make salad with creamy mustard vinaigrette I'll show you how easy it is so the two key ingredients are vinegar and olive oil I'm going to start with it vinegar got three tablespoons mustard is Dijon mustard I like chopped garlic so I'm gonna put chopped garlic and just a little hint of it not a lot and you want to chop it up really finely so that nobody gets a big bite of garlic just to flavor the vinaigrette so that should do it that goes right into the vinaigrette I use an egg yolk to mull safai the vinaigrette but if you don't want to eat a raw egg just leave it out it's just fine so one egg yolk a little bit of salt remember a vinaigrette has to be really highly seasoned because you can put a lot of lettuce leaves in lots of freshly ground black pepper my friend Patricia Welles is incredible cookbook writer and teacher said this is the most frequently asked question she gets is how to make a vinaigrette and the truth is it's really easy so I'm just gonna whisk all this together and then pour in half a cup of olive oil really slowly this looks great so here's the secret about this is I put the lettuce right on top and store it that way until I'm ready to serve it and then I toss the vinaigrette and the lettuce together at the last minute so Miguel and I have beef bourguignon salad with creamy mustard vinaigrette I think he's getting deserved Anna I need your help yes I'm not looking for me tonight and I decided to buy dessert so you want to bring dessert yes and she's making beef bourguignon would you suggest I take um something fallish I would think something pears something found buried what is that Wonder and that is a plum tart and you know what you're gonna get that tip sometime yes that is a nice one that's a good choice it's very nice at this time of year there's still nice don't get them for quite a while so um they're nice that's all scrape thank you so have a nice dinner well thank you of course you do now comes the fun part kir Royale it's a great thing to have before dinner kir Royale is creme de cassis and champagne now how bad can that be cassis is black currant liqueur and I'm just gonna put a tiny - I have to taste it make sure it's okay before Miguel gets here tiny - in the bottom of a champagne glass these are really mounting glasses but you can use old fashioned ones I'd have to open up all the champagne mmm how good does that look uh-huh hello hi Miguel just hahaha hi sweetie mwah and guess what I'm testing right now kir Royale whoa Melba for one I can lipstick all over you ruin your reputation oh my god what did you get - a little my tart from loaves and fishes oh my god this is so beautiful Wow a little kir Royale are you available little cassis just a drop right I like the glasses thank you very modern champagne glasses aren't they very nice and this is dinner with Miguel Cheers huh I can't wait to see what you brought what did you bring well first of all some roses for you Oh Miguel they're so beautiful and very French kisser sort of all green and white right I love the fair shake and because I know you're making French food yeah having you know Kyoya I also decided we're gonna set the day one with a very French EMU oh good some topiaries oh that's great so I'm gonna thank my things okay I'm gonna go sit up the table okay fantastic yeah okay bye and I'm gonna carry on with Abby for venue before you know should be a really thick and delicious stew and the traditional French one has lots of mushrooms in it so I'll show you what I do with the mushrooms you really don't want to wash them because there's something about them they just absorb all that water and they just get sort of watery so what I'm gonna do is just brush them off or the towel or paper towel anything like that and then I'm gonna slice them up and saute them in a little butter and if they're really big I'll take the stems out but it's not usually necessary so it's about a pound of mushrooms doesn't have to be exact I know Miguel is doing a table setting in there and I'm sure it's gonna be totally over the top but just gorgeous okay then the next thing I'm going to do is just slice them really thickly you don't want little thin slices want gorgeous thick slices traditionally beef bourguignonne served with noodles or potatoes but one day my assistant Barbara and I decided to test that and we found it was okay but the best thing is if you take a grilled piece of bread rub it with garlic and then pour the beef bourguignon over it it's sort of like gravy and bread who wouldn't like that it was really good so that's what I'm gonna do for Miguel okay so big chunk of butter high heat just let that melt big wooden spoon so when you're sautéing something you always want to let the butter get really hot and then throw it in it'll really seal the flavor okay nice little sizzle going and go the mushrooms so I'm just going to saute those for about 10 minutes until they're really needy and delicious and tender beef bourguignon home stretch so the mushrooms are done oh whoa oh that smells so good can't wait to see what Miguel is doing for the table setting so I only have a few more things to do with a beef bourguignon and the first is I'm gonna thicken it a little bit a little butter and flour two tablespoons of butter 3 tablespoons of flour you it's a really easy way to thicken the sauce just mash the flour and the butter together whenever room-temperature butter so they go together just takes a second but it's really worth doing right okay okay that looks like it's done just till it's all mashed together just gonna put it in and cook it just a bit I'm just going to mmm love the way this smells I can smell the cognac and the wine and carrots and onions who wouldn't want that for dinner got every last bit so beef bourguignon has small whole onions and I'm going to show you a trick instead of peeling all those onions I use frozen small whole onions and they taste just great when it comes to big onions I don't mind peeling and chopping them but when they're really small I like the frozen ones and you just dump them in mix it up the lessons the mushrooms that have been sauteed okay right in I'm gonna let this simmer away for about 15 minutes until all those flavors are together the beef and the bacon carrots onions little garlic all that wine and cognac and mushrooms it's just smells so gorgeous time for dinner so I'm just going to take a cut clove of garlic and instead of chopping it I'm just gonna rub it right on this bread so you get all the oils and the essence of garlic without the bite of it and each plate is gonna have one big chunk of country bread and lots of beef or Guignol okay a little bit of chopped parsley on the top is always nice so just run your knife along the stems and you cut off the leaves since it's just the two of us I think might be nice to have everything on the table at once so we can really relax the beef bourguignon salad with creamy mustard vinaigrette big chunk of Brie and a nice tart for dessert so I think I'll get Miguel to help me oh my god Miguel this is so beautiful like it's like a French garden like at a Mondrian Easthampton yeah it's fabulous so you want to come help me and get everything the table before you yawns ready and a little salad and a little green I'm gonna do the beef bourguignon do you want to get some salad you tell great drawer I've got the salad already but don't mix the vinaigrette on the bottom we'll mix it just before we eat it how's that mmm smells great that's not great yeah I've been looking forward to dinner all day me too I've been looking forward to seeing you and I love what you do the B oh you do oh thanks I actually stole some hydrangea leaves from my hydrangeas sexy looks very pretty yeah yeah great well of course it has to be all

you ready for a treat I'm almost ready but your face you are we're good how's that yeah no cheese and got everything great no wine for the one I love someone I just want to smell this unit from here

enough to go on my next book I think he's gonna fuck this oh good I think you're gonna drive business away from French restaurants not a little salad yeah maybe some cheese this is my secret I put the vinaigrette in the bottom and then I talked it just before ready to eat it give me the plates how about the green ones okay fantastic okay and maybe a nice slice of Brie to go with that I'll do that okay good thank you somebody else does it feel like your vacation started already one more glass and it will Cheers bon voyage grab the green that's great this is what I like one-stop shopping she loves big clothes so that's nice big bow perfect in a clear paper yes that'll be great so I need to have a cup of cognac I'm gonna pour it into the pot and now comes the fun part I'm gonna flame it stand back but the flame does is it burns off all the alcohol that leaves that gorgeous flavor of cognac okay and then I'm going to put all the meat and the bacon and all those gorgeous juices right back in and then a whole bottle of red wine good red wine you want to make sure it's wine that you drink and actually you can even serve the same wine with dinner I did say a whole bottle and then I'm going to add a little bit of beef broth just want enough so that it covers almost covers meat but not quite and don't spend days making beef broth the can of it is just fine tablespoon of tomato paste I actually get it in a tube so it's really easy mix it up the Lessing's the mushrooms that have been sauteed okay right in I'm gonna let this simmer away for about 15 minutes until all those flavors are together the beef and the bacon carrots onions little garlic all that wine and cognac and mushrooms it's just smells so gorgeous time for dinner so I'm just going to take a cut clove of garlic and instead of chopping it I'm just going to rub it right on this bread so you get all the oils and the essence of garlic without the bite of it and each plate is gonna have one big chunk of country bread and lots of beef or Guignol okay a little bit of chopped parsley on the top is always nice so just run your knife along the stems and you cut off the leaves since it's just the two of us I think might be nice to have everything on the table at once so we can really relax see what I'm trying to do is sort of set up the table to sort of French look and I think you know the topiaries have that sort of sense of French formula garden so I think I would love those three okay short short you know what I'm also gonna pick those two one I'll grab these three that's great this is what I like one-stop shopping she loves big clothes so that's nice Big Bob perfect in a clear paper yes that'll be great so I need to have a cup of cognac I'm gonna pour it into the pot and that comes the fun part I'm gonna flame it stand back what the flame does is it burns off all the alcohol that leaves a gorgeous flavor of cognac okay and then I'm going to put all the meat and the bacon and all those gorgeous juices right back in and then a whole bottle of red wine good red wine you want to make sure it's wine that you drink and actually you can even serve the same wine with dinner just do it in a single layer so they Brown really evenly oh this looks great so that meets all nice and brown and it really brings out the flavor so I'm gonna take this and take it out of the pan onto the plate with a bacon and just put it all together want to save all the juices and it's all gonna go back in the pan later okay and then the next thing I'm gonna do is put in the rest of the need this is a really traditional French recipe and I just think it's a much easier way to make it it takes much less time but it's wonderful for entertaining because you've got the meat and the vegetables and everything all together in the puff and if you make it a day or two in advance all the flavors just get better and better you just have to heat it up before dinner okay that's done I'm just gonna take this out

bacon and cook them for about ten or fifteen minutes until they're just tender and I'm gonna add two large yellow onions the easy way to thicken a sauce just mash the flour and the butter together won't have room temperature butter so they go together just takes a second but it's really worth doing right okay okay that looks like it's done just till it's all mashed together just going to put it in and cook it just a bit I'm just going to mmm love the way this smells I can smell the cognac and the wine and carrots and onions who wouldn't want that for dinner got every last bit so before gallo has small whole onions and I'm going to show you a trick instead of peeling all those onions I use frozen small whole onions and they taste just great when it comes to big onions I don't mind peeling and chopping them but when they're really small I like the frozen ones and you just dump them in mix it up and the lessons the mushrooms that have been sauteed okay right in I'm gonna let this simcha to heat it up before dinner okay that's done I'm just gonna take this out mm-hmm it smells so good already now I'm just going to finish prepping the vegetables I have a pound of carrots and now what I'm going to do is throw them into the pot with all the juices from the beef and the bacon and cook them for about ten or fifteen minutes until they're just tender and I'm going to add two large yellow onions and the tablespoon of salt and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper it seems like a lot but it's a big stew I'm just going to saute this for about 15 minutes until the vegetables are just tender and the onions are nicely browned this is so great Miguel I think is picking up flowers and dessert while I make dinner so it makes it so much easier and really more fun I love a good collaborative meal so the next thing I'm going to do for the beef bourguignon is put in chopped garlic about to close very often recipes call for onions and garlic to go in together but I think the garlic really burns very quickly so I tend to do the onions for about ten or fifteen minutes
[Music] so so herself I love making you I know they're really fresh Jeffrey and I just got them it's about a pound of scallops and the first thing I do is just salt and pepper them sometimes people salt and pepper the flour but I think it never really gets into the scallop so I'm going to salt and pepper them first and then flour them so three quarters of teaspoon of salt lots of pepper little flour and what the flour is going to do is going to sear the scallops really nicely but it's also going to get into the sauce so it's going to thicken the butter and lemon sauce okay two tablespoons of butter so for the scallops in in one layer I'm going to put them on medium heat for about two minutes and then I'll turn them and add lots of flavor can you tell the chop up some gel so two big shallots [Music] sometimes when I'm making this for dinner party I get all the ingredients all prepped in advance and the whole thing just takes five minutes in the pan so turn the scallops perfect they're nice and brown and see the browning sort of fearsome and lots of flavor [Music] okay that's not for another two minutes understand chop up some garlic so I'm going to chop up these ingredients and then just add them to the pan and make a sauce with butter and white wine could be just delicious and in order for it to be really Provencal parsley so I need about a quarter of a cup of chopped parsley I beg can that be okay just a rough chop okay now for the sauce I've got all my ingredients ready so put two tablespoons of butter in so I'm going to put in a shallot garlic and parsley quarter cup of parsley and just caught a this all together you can smell this the garlic and the shallots and parsley together about two minutes on this saute pan and then it's sort of a cup of white wine and that's going to get all the brown bits in the bottom of pan into the sauce just do the nice dry white wine but something you'd want to drink with a meal and then serve it with a dinner okay that's really it it's just perfect okay it's going to leave that for a minute like it's Merv's with the rice and dinner's ready time to serve everything up [Music]
[Music] well you can't have a cocktail party without the food and this is my formula for an easy cocktail party because I serve six orders but I only make two of them and this is the first one it's turkey key sandwiches first thing I'm doing is taking a raisin in that bread and slicing it pretty thin I'm going to get maybe about 20 slices out of it next thing is cream cheese I need 12 ounces of cream cheese if the cream cheese isn't room temperature it's gonna be very hard to spread and the sandwiches won't stick together which is really important you don't want to mess on the plate you want beautiful tea sandwiches okay so that's 12 ounces of cream cheese just give it a little bit of a stir they need a half a cup of chopped scallion that's about 4 scallion just right into the cream cheese a little salt and pepper to give it more flavor it's really important not to whip it you just want it to be really smooth but not whipped so I'm just gonna take the bread and lay them out I tend to do things assembly wine just lay them right out like that important thing is to put the cream cheese on both sides of the bread so when you put them together they stick together and just free cream cheese on all the pieces of bread just a thin layer don't neglect the corners and for the quantities three or four pieces per person and you'll always have enough next is the turkey so what I've got is smoked turkey so we want to do is just cover each sandwich with one layer of smoked turkey and you only want to put it on half the sandwiches because of course the other ones are going to be the top okay that's is the basil I'm just putting one leaf on each sandwich basil is really great because it's really peppery it just gives great flavor to this [Music] and then the taps go on I'm going to put the tops you want to make sure they line top and press them a little so they stick okay onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper so I'm going to refrigerate these until the cream cheese is really cold and then it stays together very well okay and this is the trick for keeping them really moist damp paper towel to take two paper towels some of them just slightly damp only slightly just dampen it and then squeeze it out hopefully they stay together I'm going to store this just like this in the refrigerator for about an hour until they get nice and firm if I'm going to store them so longer than that or reposeful thing in plastic wrap and if they just delicious for like six hours so get these nice and cold and then cut them just before the party when the sandwiches are cold put them on a board cut the crusts off with a very sharp knife then cut each sandwich and a half I do it diagonally I think it looks great but the little triangle with sandwiches onto a square platter with the points up I arrange them in two rows then because I like to garnish it with something that's in the sandwich I put a bunch of basil on the platter
[Music] my friend Roberts Dylan's birthday what do you get a guy who has everything so I thought I'd cook my a really special birthday dinner he'll invite the guests and then all he has to do is sit back and have fun who wouldn't want that first birthday I'm making a juicy rack of lamb with garlic and parsley creamy potato fennel Greta sautéed carrots and for dessert a heart-shaped Kurla creme with the fresh raspberry and Bret linear sauce and the best thing about this present is there nothing to return to the store so I was trying to figure out what would be a nice birthday dessert for Robert and I have to say at some point nobody needs to have candles on a birthday cake so I thought well maybe something heart-shaped and I thought about a Corolla creme which is a heart-shaped cream dessert and it's absolutely delicious so that's what we're making I'm gonna serve it with a raspberry sauce so I'm gonna start with 12 ounces of room-temperature cream cheese it's not the whipped cream cheese it's regular cream cheese very important detail this dessert actually comes from my friend on a pump writes the loaves and fishes cookbook she made it for us for dessert once we not only ate our desserts we like diving into the serving platter it wasn't pretty it was so good one and a quarter cups of confectioner's sugar it's one time that get it all over ourselves in another quarter I'm just gonna mix those up just the mexican bottom you don't want to whip it okay it's really important that it's room temperature cream cheese otherwise it'll never work leave it out for hours so that's the beater and I'm going to switch to a whisk attachment that's the whisk and if you have the handheld mixer that one beater will do the job of both and now I'm gonna add two and a half cups of cold heavy cream it has to be cold otherwise it won't whip just a most speed start pouring it in this is gonna whip like whipped cream is can get very light and fluffy and just a few flavorings two teaspoons of vanilla vanilla extract [Music] cordobas piece for the lemon zest just a little bit if you want to be really decadent the season of vanilla bean and not only tastes great but it also then looks like it's vanilla the spirit that seeds it out you look great me this curl like friend so now I'm just gonna whip it until it's thick like whipped cream that should do it okay so now the next step is to put it in the mold and this is what a curl a creme mold is I'm going to pour it into this and the liquid is going to drain out and what's gonna be left is something really thick and absolutely delicious and I'm gonna put it on a plate because you wanted to drain on the plate not into your refrigerator and I'm gonna line the mold with cheesecloth you can buy it in the hardware store you can really use paper towels but I prefer cheesecloth because it'll make a nice design on the outside of the car la creme mold yeah pour this into the mold that doesn't that look gorgeous now I'm gonna pull the sides of this up and cover it and I'm gonna refrigerate it and overnight some of the liquid from the cheese is going to come out and it's gonna get really thick almost like a cheese itself tomorrow I'm gonna start with fresh raspberry sauce it was back and now I'm getting a good night's sleep because I have a lot to do for Roberts party teddy bear town is a really classic French dish but I thought I'd turn up the volume and make it a fennel it has a really sort of anise flavor I love it this is a great utensil to have it's a mandolin it's been really sharp so be very careful but it's so much better than using a knife because the slices can be absolutely regular so I've 2 pounds of potatoes but first I have some onions and fennel cooking together it's two small heads of fennel or one big one if you have one big one 1 onion 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter and I've cooked them for about 15 minutes until they're really nicely softened okay so now I'm just going to combine everything big ball one of the best things about this dish is you can make it in advance which is what I'm gonna do refrigerate it and then bake it off just before the party I'm gonna take it to Robert's house so it's 2 pounds of russet potatoes peeled and sliced oops I get them all on the bowl cook fennel and onions it's so good and then 2 cups of cream and two cups of grated Gruyere cheese okay teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper toss it all together it doesn't look bad so far okay I'm just gonna put it in a greased baking dish anything you have oval dish square dish whatever you have so when this bakes the starch and the potatoes and the cheese are gonna make the cream set like a custard this is a hands job clean hands just press it all down in the dish into the fridge and then I'm gonna bake it off at Roberts house and it's gonna be creamy and delicious and he's so good with the garlic and parsley of the rack of lamb parsley on which I'm going to do that [Music] great need lots of parsley preparer say odd I need parsley and garlic but I actually add some lemon zest I'm gonna chop it all up with breadcrumbs and pack it on a rack of lamb and it's gonna be so and flowers run your knife right along the edge doesn't have to be perfect Presley's always used for decoration but the truth is it's got great flavor it's never out of season always available and very inexpensive it doesn't have to be perfect it's all going in the food processor okay two cups of fresh chopped parsley right in with a steel blade three cloves of garlic it's about a tablespoon and half a stick of butter melted and cooled I'm just gonna chop it up quickly okay two more ingredients the zest of two lemons my favorite zester grass just get the outside of the lemon not the white part that's what has the flavor and oil just think how good this is gonna be with the lamb it's gonna really flavor the meat parsley garlic lemon zest mm-hmm it's gonna be a real birthday dinner okay zest of two lemons okay one cup of fresh breadcrumbs I'm just gonna pulse it for a second to combine them okay so this is gonna go in the lamb it's gonna flavor it incredibly well I'm just gonna put it in the container and so I'm ready I put Robert in charge of martinis I hope you're not drinking to them and still has to be the hose [Music] I know there's nothing to chance she even left me the directions for the martinis two cups of fresh pineapple juice two and a half cups of vodka 1/4 of a cup of the road 2 teaspoons of Chambord and that's it even I can't get this wrong so bet you think French sauces are really hard to make watch this one raspberry sauce so easy so I'm gonna start with 1/2 a cup of sugar 1/4 of a cup of water and 1/2 the punch of fresh raspberries this raspberry sauce is gonna be amazing with the Kurla creme it's the creme is so creamy and the raspberry sauce it's both sweet but it's also tart because of the raspberries so I'm just gonna heat this through for about 4 minutes till all the juices from the raspberries come out and next I need raspberry jam and Grand Marnier raspberry jam Grand Marnier ready to go look like the raspberries are just done perfect well the gorgeous juice wonderful okay so I'm gonna pour this into the food processor I'll play it in the food processor not on me and watch this two more ingredients a cup of raspberry jam I prefer c-list but it doesn't whichever you like is fine the cup is just just this jar two tablespoons of Grand Marnier liqueur which is orange liqueur but if you have firm boss which is raspberry liqueur it's also delicious puree it [Applause] and that's raspberry sauce [Music] and now not McRoberts [Music] flowers my garden and I've got the main course terrific okay until you clear the decks all right so let me tell you what we have for dinner we have to find piercing on yeah I'm clean garlic little lemon zest sautéed carrots and potatoes fennel fresh ham mmm I think the ovens going down yesterday sure about 400 degrees for about an hour an hour and 15 minutes I think that's gonna be pretty good and dessert the surprise dessert all right I'm gonna get to work okay great is it what can I do okay sure I'll get the house ready and get myself ready so clear all this off it's fun cooking in somebody else's kitchen change up menu I've got three racks each rack is really perfect for about two people with leftovers and actually ask the butcher to French this which means he took all the extra meat off the bones it's much more elegant so just put them on the pan with the fat side up just like that maybe a little olive oil salt and pepper so just drizzle a little bit of olive oil on the top just enough so it Browns nicely sprinkle it with salt and pepper lamb is actually really easy to cook but it's a little expensive so it's a great birthday dinner okay so the first part is I'm going to roast this at 450 degrees for 10 minutes and then later I'm going to take it out and put the parsley and garlic and breadcrumbs and lemon zest it's gonna be so delicious to the middle of the dish gorgeous fresh raspberry sauce just pour it around I'm gonna serve a little more on the side but just for now just smush it around and if she'd get a little bit on the platter and just wipe it off okay and then fresh raspberries right on top I'm just gonna leave this in the fridge and it's all ready to serve for Roberts birthday dessert so it's ten minutes and the records lamb is ready to come out for its and parsley oh it's starting to brown they look just great and now I'm gonna put the pair say out on parsley garlic bread crumbs and lemon zest just press it on the top you can smell it already just getting it on the hot lamb gorgeous does that look great I love when something looks good and tastes good okay just a little more in the first one and back in the oven for another 15 minutes Wow that's gonna be great all okay you guys have a good time one last thing to do to get ready so take carrots so I've got a little bit of water in here salt and pepper and I got the cat's already at home it's always a good idea anyway do them in advance just put them in here just toss them around so I get the seasoning on them okay snow cover them for seven minutes cook really nice and in there and then I think they need a little bit of butter at the end so I think that grant town should be done not half bad then the lack of land should be perfectly cooked now ah that's rack of lamb per se alive and still coverage people the juices in so this is the trick about the carrots as in seven minutes all the waters evaporated and they're perfectly cooked I'm staying a little bit of butter to it mix it in and they're done okay that's done we're just gonna keep them on with the lid up Wow I don't think Roberts going to be disappointed I'm gonna carve it up it's perfectly cooked in pink okay that's going all right we're almost ready bring the dish does it

[Music] I'm having a baby shower I'm going to make two huge platters of some and the suave and everybody can just help themselves I'm making a marinade for the salmon to sit on it for a little while and then the rest are really high temperature it's delicious so the first thing I need is the zest of four lemons okay that's good so I'm just going to put this all in a big bowl next thing is a quarter of a cup of olive oil quarter of a cup of mustard I'd love to use Dijon mustard I think has great flavor and then I'm going to put in lots of garlic and a four cloves of garlic chopped right into the marinade make sure it's really flavorful one and a half tablespoons of salt half a tablespoon of pepper I'm going to whisk this all together and then spread it on the salmon now this is a great flavour to smell it or brandy simply put all this on top of the salmon and let the flavors get into the meat of the salmon it will sit for about 15 minutes and there's a roasted a very high temperature perfect what I have a four and a half pounds of these Erica very french stream beans you can really find them anywhere and put them right into how to boiling water a little bit of salt especially blanching is a great way to cook a lot of vegetables put it in a hot boiling water cook it for 3-4 minutes depending on the vegetable until it's crisp but still tender and then you shock it by putting in ice water stops the cooking sets the color and make sure they're stay crisp to the wonderful so just take the beans out they don't cook very long at all into the ice water stop the cooking time to cook the famine I'm going to cook it at 500 degrees for about 12 to 15 minutes and the high heat really sort of creme lies at the top it's so much flavor okay I'm going to cook 12 eggs and turn on the heat and here's my foolproof hard-boiled egg trick bring the water up to a boil turn off the heat leave the eggs in for five minutes exactly and then take them out and let them cool at room temperature for two minutes and then peel them it's perfect every time no dark circles around the yolks okay I think the salmon is ready so that's perfect it's nice and browned on the top wonderful now comes the fun part assembling the salmon this wise platter so I chilled the salmon so it flakes really nicely I'm just going to take big pieces of it and put it right on the platter salmon is perfectly cooked it's sort of medium-rare and you can see all the flavors on top the garlic and just wonderful just big bold flakes of salmon piled up the main course is the salmon so I'm just going to put it right down the middle okay so the next thing is the potatoes so they've steamed they've cooled and I've sliced some big thick slices I'm going to do two platters so many people I just want to make sure everybody has lots to eat and then tomatoes I took medium size tomatoes and cut them in 6 and the area vert which we steamed and blanched everything's room temperature the key about a big platter is just big blocks of color you know what a little here in a little there you want big blocks of color okay next is hard cooked eggs this really classic salad nicoise it's just done with roasted salmon so rather than to and I just think it has so much more flavor so I'm going to do a big bunch of water crab instead of little bits of it around just one big bunch it really sort of balances the green I have olives can have a salad nicoise of that olives so instead of black olives which we have in the gazpacho I'm going to use green olives and for those of us that love anchovies just a few lanch ovaries but I wouldn't put it all over just in a few places so anybody that loves them can help themselves okay the last thing is the vinaigrette really quick quarter cup of champagne vinegar teaspoon of mustard good Dijon mustard is essential salt and pepper make sure it's really well flavored and half a cup of olive oil I like things we vinaigrette in the world I love the way the mustard emulsified this vinaigrette okay I'm just going to pour it over the vegetables particularly the potatoes make sure they have lots of flavor a little drizzle and everything else oh I think I hear girls voices I think there's a party about to start I can't wait to see Sinead phase [Music]
I think there's a restaurant in America that doesn't have a chicken Caesar salad on the menu I could take something really traditional and do it with a twist and I thought wouldn't it be fun to take the croutons and put it on the outside so I'm going to make a chicken Caesar salad sandwich so I'm going to start with ciabatta and I'm going to put it on a sheet tray and bake it at 350 for about five to seven minutes until it's just a little toasted next thing is the pancetta I'm going to take eight slices of pancetta and just put the map in a single layer oh shoot tray I'm going to bake at one with the ciabatta until it's nice and crisp like bacon okay last two pieces into the oven 350 degrees this one for five to seven minutes this one for 15 [Music] I cooked some chicken for the sandwich actually I find this is such a great way to do it it's on the bone with the skin on olive oil salt and pepper 350 degrees 35 minutes it's really moist perfect so the best part of this sandwich is that garlicky Caesar dressing that I'm going to make for it first I want to start with garlic right into the food processor okay next two tablespoons of chopped parsley okay that's about two tablespoons try it in the food processor next thing is anchovy paste critical for Caesar dressing one and a half teaspoons anchovy paste gives this really great flavor one teaspoon of Dijon mustard just process that until the garlic and the parsley are minced great okay now some lemon juice got one head tablespoons no okay half a cup of mayonnaise okay just make a nice smooth sauce [Music] and that's he's addressing first slab of this sandwich and the toasted bread really is going to absorb all this great sauce okay time to layer the sandwich first I'm going to start with a layer of Navy rule if you can find it nice and peppery it's great with us okay the next thing is sun-dried tomato this is going to make that five or six sandwiches next thing is Madonn cheese I think it's so much nicer if you have like a whole slice of it right on top next is the cooked pancetta right down the middle so the next thing is chicken so I'm just going to take the skin off and then slice it right on this sandwich okay right I'll give it sandwich right down the middle okay a little salt and pepper on top of the chicken pepper last thing is some arugula right on top put the top on and just slice it exemptions it's going to be really good I don't know if we'll get any work done it'll be delicious we're going to need a nap instead of getting any work done hmm we can get this one on [Music]
[Music] [Music] I was worried that when I'm away Jeffrey lives on milk and cookies let's be way tonight so I thought I want to stock the fridge with all kinds of delicious things for him to eat and maybe it'll keep them out of the cookie jar first I'm making a delicious beef stew it's easy for him to heat up for dinner whole meal in one pot and because dessert is the best part of the meal I'm making this favored espresso ice cream then for breakfast the next day I'm leaving them homemade cranberry orange scones you can have with this coffee in the morning well helping it doesn't freeze the stew and heat up the ice cream but I'll be calling to find out what he's up to [Music] since Jeffrey's having dinner on his own I thought I'd make some of his favorite things and one of them is definitely ice cream so I'm going to make espresso ice cream it's really good and it has real espresso in it I need three cups of half-and-half she's going to heat the melt until it's called it which means that there's a little lot of bubbles around the outside and there's steam starting to come from it but it's not boiling so I need six egg yolks into the mixer two thirds of a cup of sugar pinch of salt check on the milk looks good you can see line of bubbles around the outside and some steam rising from it okay again sir john i'll show you what it looks like it's amazing to me that egg yolks end up getting so thick like this is that fabulous just egg yolks and sugar a little bit of salt and now on low speed I'm just going to pour the milk slowly into the egg yolks and you want them to keep moving so that you don't cook the egg yolks I got most of it on the counter okay and now i'm going to put all of this back into the pan and cook it very slowly until it thickens this is one of those times you want to stir it constantly until it really thickens then I'm going to flavor with all kinds of delicious things cuff fuel occur and ground espresso and then freeze it and I'm a really good ice cream for Jeffrey this really is one of those things you just have to stand here and stir it the minute you walk away the whole thing just curdles just keep doing this until it gets thick enough to cut the spoon and when you run your finger oh that was hot run your finger down it really leaves the line so it's perfect it's done and now I'm just going to sit it just make sure there's nothing in it that got to thickened that looks gorgeous okay now for the flavorings first one is espresso it's actually ground espresso it's not instant espresso so two and a half tablespoons of ground espresso you can use either regular or decaf tablespoon of coffee liqueur it smells so good and a teaspoon of good banal and just whisk that all together okay that's good I love the way the espresso lips on it okay I'm going to chill it and then later I'm gonna make espresso ice cream I want to make a great big beef stew for Jeffrey and I need rosemary and bay leaves I both in my garden Rosemary's one of my favorite herbs I've always been small fan inside but I want a big plant I've got one outside it's great with lamb and marinades gonna be really good miss beef stew [Music] and now I just need a few bay leaves we're going to marinate the meat for the beef stew and they leaves red wine to be just delicious I actually call this beef stew Parker's beef stew because it was originally made by the chef of barren desert oh so wonderful Parker Hodges so what I've done is I have two and a half pounds of beef it's chuck and I've cut it in cubes you can always have the butcher do it but I prefer to do it myself say end up with sort of regular sized cubes otherwise you have a tiny little pieces and big pieces but you can do that so I'm going to marinate it and that's really what makes Parker's beef stew so delicious three cloves of garlic I'm actually smashed in the cloves of garlic I don't chop them up cuz I don't want to cook them with the beef I wish the map flavor over cooked garlic is not pretty mmm it really releases all the oil okay that's one and I'm going to put in maybe two or three fresh bay leaves and this is the good part a whole bottle of red wine something like a Cabernet Sauvignon so I'm going to marinate the beef in this red wine but I'm also going to use it when I took the sauce okay just stir it all up you I can already smell the flavor so that's a red wine flavor and the garlic so I'm gonna marinate this for a few hours but you can certainly do it overnight it only gets better [Music] so I'm ready to make the beef stew i marinated the beef for a few hours now what I'm going to do is drain it but I want to save the marinade cuz when these later for cooking roll it around that seasoned flour and then saute it in olive oil okay so I've got lots of great vegetables I've taken onions and chopped them up and I have a pound of carrots just going to cut big chunks I like what it looks like big chunks just cut the carrots evenly so that they cook and exactly the same amount of time okay so that's the carrots I'll get carrots onions garlic sun-dried tomatoes potatoes which I'm going to cut them quarters these are great they're Yukon Gold the data so they're sort of that buttery yellow if there's small potatoes cut them in half if they're big cut them in quarters and you don't even have to peel them and the last thing is a half a pound of mushrooms just cut the stems just slice them in half this is a great thing to make for parties first of all I think people really expect something more elegant for a party and they're just thrilled to have beef stew but the second thing is it really sits very well it just tastes better it the longer it sits okay that's all the vegetables that looks great wonder how the beasts doing Oh perfect just going to turn each piece so brands evenly used to have to be that you cook stew for four or five hours until it was really tender because the chuck was very tough but I think meat is much tenderer now that equality and so two or three hours in the evidence will be delicious okay that's done it smells wonderful you really smell the wine that the marinade and view than the sea okay I'm just a little more oil and I'm going to cook all the vegetables and potatoes it's really hot be really careful it's hot the onions it's too large onions just saw TVs for about 10 minutes so they start to brown sautéing the vegetables gives them so much flavor and also because they're going to pick up the beef flavor from the pan so this is the marinade that the beef k matta so strain it vegetables are done so I'm going to put the garlic into the sauté pan and sauté the garlic I put it in the last minute so it doesn't burn this smells so good the carrots and onions and potatoes and now the garlic just wonderful just don't want to hurry you want the onions to be really thoroughly cooked and then take this whole thing and pour it into the pot that's going in the oven just dump it mmm what is that some oak red ok now I'm going to deglaze the pan two and a half cups of the marinade and it's so wine that's going to do that and just scrape up any brown bits that are in the pan because that's really what's going to flavor the sauce ok just going to pour that into the our pot kinda nice and clean the kidnap mmm that's what make a really nice sauce ok now more things to flavor the sauce two cups of chicken stock I always have some in the freezer two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce gives it real depth of flavor one tablespoon of salt sounds like a lot but it's a lot of beef stew two teaspoons of pepper and then to give it lots of flavor half a cup of sun-dried tomatoes and one sprig of fresh rosemary well this goes really wonderful the rosemary into the stock and then just mix it up a little bit this is gonna be so good all the flavors are going to Mel together potatoes and carrots and onions sun-dried tomatoes and the sauce and be so delicious into the oven 304 two to three hours and the beat is going to be so tender vegetables are going to be cooked in the sauce is gonna be so wonderful time to freeze the espresso ice cream that looks so good it's nice and called and this is the insert for the ice cream machine comes out of the freezer so it's really cold just going to pour this in and love that you can see the espresso went out and I'm going to chill this in the ice cream machine until it's almost frozen with this insert in secret mission turn it on it's going to freeze until it's almost hard and just before I put it into the freezer I'm going to turn up the flavor with chopped chocolate covered espresso beans how good does that sound [Music] I'm crushing a chocolate-covered espresso beans to put in my coffee ice cream for Jeffrey he's going to really love this these are actually very cool because it's chocolate it's going to hold espresso bean right in the middle so good if you can't find them you can always find coffee flavored beans that you chopped up but something that has a little crunch like that it's really wonderful and the chocolate and the coffee together is particularly great and I'm just going to put it right in it'll mix in with the ice cream who is that going to be good okay it never freezes really hard in the ice cream freezer so I was like to put it into the freezer to freeze completely it needs at least an hour in the freezer to get the consistency of ice cream okay so I'm going to put it into a container and put it in the freezer does not look gorgeous which everybody save some of this for me it looks really good okay into the freezer and he's gonna have espresso ice cream for dinner well I'm almost home and mine is the wait for the evening he will typically leave me a ton of food in the refrigerator it's really tough being mr. Gordon some of that two or three hours the Sioux should be ready it smells so good in here oh that's a lot oh that looks just fabulous we're just going to make sure the meats done justjust it with a fork if it's tender it's done and when this sauce looks looks freedom is he actually I'm going to put one package of frozen peas in I'm just going to let them defrost and just cook in let us do the next thing i want to make for him is a little something for breakfast so i'm from the oven from 300 to 400 degrees then i'm going to make cranberry orange scones he's going to be really spoiled i'm going to start with 4 cups of flour according to cup of sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder it looks really nice little mind kitschy spoons of salt makes a lot of scones mix it together chip is pearl orange zest it's just cost great can't make scones with that butter so it's got three quarters of a pound of butter just want very very cold butter what a cubed reason why you um cold butter is because you wanted to stay together so when it goes into the oven and the heat hits the butter the water makes this going pop up and get nice light flaky scones okay three comes a pound of butter I'm just going to turn the mixer on low and just mix it until the butter is really about the size of peas okay next thing I need is for eggs it's going to beat them up we want to make sure all the ingredients are really cold so the butter stays called and a cup of heavy cream ok it's just the size of people it's going to make it very wet dough but a good ok now I'm going to add some cranberries but I quarter of a cup of dried cranberries quarter of a cup of flour to make sure they mix nicely through the mixture dried cranberries are better than fresh cranberries fresh grandpa's old too hard for this ok and then slowly put them in so they get mixed into the dough Thanks it's alive oh just a good thing about these scones is they can sit in the refrigerator for a while before I baked them and I can freeze the dough and bake them off as I need them ok it was great I can smell the orange see the cranberry ok I like she's rolling silver flower it a little bit roll it out to Beth well maybe about three quarters of an inch to an inch thick and handle it as little as possible so the butter doesn't melt I'm going to do around so that's about three quarters of an inch sheet pan lined with parchment paper and just are just brush the tub quickly with lightly with a little egg wash it gives them a really nice brown color just sprinkle a little sugar just a nice shine okay into the oven 20 to 25 minutes 400 degrees and Jeffrey's gonna have a really good breakfast [Music] and I'm going to make the rest of the stones of free [Music] so the cranberry orange goes are cooled more is looking for ways to give everything more flavor so I thought why don't I make an orange glaze for them it's really simple half a cup of confectioner's sugar a little bit of orange juice and lifters al on top [Music] probably about three teaspoons and before just want to thick enough so it's a glaze but thin enough so I can pour it if you get it too thick you can have a little more juice if you get it to the fins you can just add a little more confectioner sugar actually love the way it looks it's on so it should be just about that consistency thick but you can pour it ok little drizzle of the scones I some scones left over I'm going to freeze the dough and then I'm going to bake them off before I want to serve them and then once they're cooled she was living with orange plays extra these are cool spoon just like that I take Jeffers can have very nice breakfast okay I'm off no for Jeffrey why do I think he's gonna start on the ice cream gotta go hello hi sweetie oh just great are you

[Music] I've had a very good friend since high school and I've known his daughter Phoebe since she was born Phoebe's in college now how did that happen so fast I've invited her and some of her school chums for brunch tomorrow the good news is making lots of things in advance so I can have fun at the party too first I'm making gravlax which is cured salmon I'm gonna slice it really thin serve it on brown bread with mustard sauce then delicious blueberry coffee cake muffins that I can mix in advance and bake off just before they arrive and a spectacular fruit platter and to drink feel good orange banana smoothies that will get them started for the day I imagine these girls live on peanut butter and crackers at school so it's going to be really nice for them to have a home-cooked meal first thing I'm going to make for my brunch is gravlax which is the sweetest specialty it's cured salmon and it's cured with sugar salt and fresh dill lots of it it's a great thing for entertaining because I can make it really far in advance and it requires no cooking at all my particular favorite so I've got about three pounds of fresh salmon you know generally for brunch very often serve smoked salmon and I thought well why not serve gravlax which is a cured salmon so instead of smoking it to cook it it actually sits in the sugar and the salt and it actually cures it so it's just wonderful it's so delicious so first I need one piece of salmon and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cover it with lots of fresh dill so this is all washed just shake it out make sure it's dry and just put it right on top how's that for easy so the next thing I needs 1/2 a cup of sugar I know it sounds like an enormous amount of sugar but it really needs it to cure and you have 2 cup of kosher salt I really would use kosher salt for this really has sort of a softer flavor and since you're using so much what's gonna happen is this is gonna sit in the refrigerator or night and it just marinates in its juices and its really gonna just cure it which is wonderful take 2 tablespoons of white peppercorns white peppercorns are sort of slightly less ripe and black peppercorns and they're a little milder so they're really good and one tablespoon of fennel seed it's the whole fennel seed but I'm just gonna crush them up so you really release the flavour of them this is actually called a mortar and pestle and it's great for sort of cracking pepper and grinding things up but if you don't have one you can always use one of those little coffee grinders I save one just for spices you don't want to find taste or fine grind you just want to sort of crack pepper it really flavors the salmon and you get a little bit of a workout at the same time when I first thought Barefoot Contessa from Cayenne Estrada who's still my friend came with a wonderful collection of recipes and this is one of them gravlax with a mustard sauce and lots of fresh dill okay this is good I just want to crack so it really releases the oils mmm can really smell the fennel and pepper so the next thing I want to do is take the other piece of salmon and put it right over the top just like that you know just gonna cover it with foil and now here's the fun part I'm gonna wait it and that's gonna bring some of the juices out of the salmon not easy to do see if I can balance all of this perfect so I'm gonna leave it for about 12 hours to flip it over and it's gonna be ready in 24 hours but the good news is the longer you let it sit the better if I can get it this in the fridge [Music] from French tomorrow I thought Phoebe and her friends would enjoy smoothies so I'm gonna make an orange banana smoothie the good news I can make it in advance so I need one and a half cups of fresh orange juice I mean you can certainly buy it squeezed but it's always so much better when you make it yourself they're really a million ways to make smoothies but I like putting different combinations together and I think classic is orange and banana that's just one and a half cups perfect and to the blender and then the next thing is I'm gonna put in either one or one and a half bananas the more banana you put in the thicker it gets it's really about balancing the flavor so it tastes really good but one flavor doesn't predominate and then some strawberries got a cup really don't have to chop them up just cut them in half they're gonna get pureed you can use anything you can find in the refrigerator that would go good with this blueberries raspberries so I bet a cup of strawberries okay and then because I don't want it too sweet I'm gonna add a little bit of lime juice to it so I'm just living one the juice of one lime [Music] just as it's about the depth of flavor of use just it really makes a difference okay juice of one lime perfect and since I'm serving them tomorrow I'm just gonna put them in a container the banana keeps it from separating it's gonna be so good for brunch tomorrow next I'm gonna make blueberry coffee cake muffins I love them [Music] last thing I want to do is get up at five o'clock in the morning to make blueberry coffee cake muffins so I'm gonna make the batter tonight and then tomorrow just scoop them out and bake them I need one and a half sticks of butter this makes a lot of muffins makes about 16 according to half cups of sugar and just beat that until it's light and fluffy I need three extra-large eggs okay I'm gonna add the eggs one at a time okay that's some great flavors one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla extract love the way it smells eight ounces of sour cream this is what makes the muffins really moist and a quarter of a cup of milk okay that's the wet ingredients now for the dry ones I need two and a half cups of flour it is unbleached flour but any all-purpose flour is just fine perfect I need two teaspoons of baking powder 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda this mixture has the acidity of the sour cream so it's good to have baking powder and baking soda and half a teaspoon of salt [Music] I'm just sift it together try and get it in the bowl and I'm on the counter like I did and then a very low speed just mix the dry ingredients into the wet ones particularly with muffins you don't want to over beat it otherwise they end up being very dense so I'm just going to mix it in just until it's combined okay it's gonna give it one turn with the spatula I think with a mixer you always want to be sure that the bottom is really well mixed I saw and just turn the bottom make sure it's really well combined but not over next and I'm just going to have lots of blueberries two kinds of blueberries just fold them in we're gonna refrigerate the batter overnight in the morning all I have to do is scoop the muffins into the pans and bake them off and I've got three gorgeous smart girls coming for brunch we can have a really good time I've done everything I need to do today I'm gonna pack it in for the night [Music] four years of African test I used to make these gorgeous fruit platters and I started making them at home too they're wonderful for parties you can do them in advance and they're just delicious the most important thing is make sure you're really good fruit so for example like with Kiwis you want to make sure they are soft and they smell wonderful when you pick them up at the grocery store that they smell like Kiwis Kiwis I like to slice cuz I love to see the black seeds and they're incredibly good for you too next thing I have is a pineapple and looks like an ordinary pineapple but but it's actually a golden pineapple which is really fabulous they're so sweet you can find them in any produce store around the country so when to cut off the top I don't really like to you is that it's decoration on the platter it's not so pretty just cut it in half go this one's perfect something save that for another time just cut it right down the middle and the core of its delicious but it's really kind of hard so I'm gonna cut it out save it for the cook and then the small knife just run it right around the the rind of the pineapple let's take the whole piece out you know I just like to slice it right across you look really pretty fanned out on the platter smells so good and you can really tell when it's ripe because it really smells like pineapple okay now I'm just gonna take the core out again stand it up and then slice this to really is a Becca line of the store and seeing what's ripe and what's in season and what's delicious at all times that you can always find things that are just wonderful I don't even go with an idea of exactly what I want I go knowing I want fruit and I'll find the most flavorful the things that smell the most fragrant I usually like from melons I like a Galia melon which is it a green melon from Israel or Kevin or melon which is orange from France but this cantaloupe was the most fragrant I found so that's what I got so I'm just gonna do the same thing when I cut this cut the rind off I just want to take all the green off it's really not very pretty just need to scoop the seeds at this melon smells so ripe it's wonderful and it was nice I sit all the way across big big slices and that'll be beautiful on the platter okay the Nexus mango I'm gonna cut it on its side and just cut the edge off you have to cut right around the seed you know this this one's gorgeous and then I'm gonna peel it I think I'll do it in like big wedges okay just a few more things to do and the some of the fruit platter put the muffins in the oven and slice their gravlax I can't wait to see Phoebe this is going to be really fun [Music] so I'm going to start building this platter I really rely on that old Japanese design principle which is sky earth and water so there's something tall something solid in the middle and something flowing forward it's amazing it works every time something solid that comes up grapes well I think I put the strawberries here around the edges are flowing forward like the water and the berries blueberries okay the last thing is lemon leaves okay I'm just gonna put this in the fridge and get on with the rest of brunch so I'm gonna bake off the blueberry sour cream coffee cake muffins one of the tricks I learned at Barefoot Contessa is if I just greased the top of the muffin pans they don't stick to the top no point in making muffins if you can't get them out of the pans this batter will make about 16 big muffins okay that should do it and then I used white paper muffin cups I just think they're a little more elegant than the colored ones anything that ensures you can get the muffins out of the pans okay the next trick is ice cream scoop nice big ice to discover rounded one makes the perfect sized muffin there's gonna be more than enough for brunch but I'm gonna give the girls leftovers to take back to school I always have the feeling they live on mac and cheese so it'll be nice to have good muffins sixteen exactly I'm good okay until the oven 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes and we're gonna have fresh blueberry sour cream coffee cake muffins [Music] [Applause] let's see how this looks now no it's beautiful it's beautifully cured you can see all the flavouring on top I'm actually gonna scrape some of this off some of the seeds perfect okay now I want to show you what I'm really good at slicing salmon when I first bought Barefoot Contessa it was the toughest thing that dan Estrada had to show me he's had a slice salmon but I've really learned how to do it since then I can't imagine how many thousands the sides of smoked salmon I've sliced and slicing gravlax is pretty much the same thing so this is a smoked salmon knife if you have a small flexible knife like that it makes it so much easier I start back here and in the beginning I couldn't do a whole slice so I do one side first and then the other side and that's okay too so I'm just gonna line it up here and then I'll arrange it on the platter so you want to slice it so it's really sort of translucent and it just takes time to figure it out but a little practice and you can do it so now I'm gonna do one big slice just do it really slowly and just the key is to let the blade work it's not about pushing it it's just about letting a nice sharp blade do its job I'm just do it very casually on the plate it really looks like smoked salmon but it's got the wonderful cured flavor of fennel and peppercorns a little bit of dill we're gonna make mustard sauce I'm almost ready for the party [Music] Scandinavians traditionally served mustard sauce with gravlax I'll show you how quick it is so I need quarter of a cup of mustard Dijon mustard I'm just gonna whisk it all together in the bowl and to give the mustard even more flavor I'm going to use dry mustard one teaspoon three tablespoons of sugar remember the gravlax was marinated in sugar and salt so it's sort of sweet and salty at the same time two tablespoons of white wine vinegar so it's sweet and vinegary the third of a cup of olive oil and so what I'm going to do is whisk these ingredients together and then slowly pour the olive oil in then I'm gonna add some lots of fresh dill just pour it in slowly so it gets incorporated it's creamy as with mayonnaise the egg yolks emulsify the oil but this sauce the mustard doesn't okay I'm gonna chop up lots of fresh dill this is really the time to use fresh dill since it's such an important flavor I need about three tablespoons okay right into the sauce just whisk it in oh this looks really good mmm really taste all the mustard from dill little vinegar it's gonna be wonderful I'm gonna let everybody make their own little sandwiches with brown bread Sam and this gorgeous mustard sauce I think it's a really fun who needs a centerpiece when you have a platter fresh fruit I'm so glad you're here totally at home so just dig in help yourself with fruit its fingers and there's salmon can I help you - salmon so the grog bucks is its raw salmon and then it's covered with salt and sugar most mostly sauce a little bit of sugar and lots of dill then you put the other piece on top and you weight it and then it goes into the refrigerator it like cooks in the refrigerator actually cures and they refrigerate it so do you like to cook I love to gluten that's kind of hard yeah oh yeah that's right I did know that I forgot and everybody want to come over right yeah so I think I want to send you back with to college with all the muffins what do you think I can go back to college you can say forever I'm answering to you but you can stay forever yeah sorry too much fun [Music]
[Music] shrimp bisque I love it but every recipe I've seen is really complicated I decided to see if I can make a really simple version it's just delicious I bought fish stock and I've added the shrimp shells to it to give it even more flavor I'm going to strain the fish stock I need 3 and 3/4 cups so if I have a little less I'm just going to add some water yeah just a little water okay so first thing I've done here is sauteed 2 cups of leeks and 3 tablespoons of olive oil make sure the links are really really clean before you cook them okay I'm going to add some garlic about a tablespoon of garlic just saute it for about a minute actually love shrimp bisque and like that rich shrimp flavor and a little bit of sherry so the next thing I need is a little bit of cayenne pepper just a pinch not too much you don't want to overpower the shrimp and just cook that together ok and then a pound of shrimp is where the shells came from and just cook the shrimp for about three minutes until they're perfectly pink and just tender and the shrimp's cooked I'm going to add the rest of the ingredients and a really rich delicious shrimp it I can't make good shrimp bisque that sherry but I've actually decided little cognac would help it too so let me start with a quarter of a cup of cognac and pour it right into the shrimp and leek butter cook from it and that smells good and a quarter of a cup of dry sherry and all that's just going to really get into the shrimp and flavor the soup now that smells like shrimp bisque shrimp and sherry so classic look I'm going to puree this now I'm going to just put it right into the food processor and I'm just in puree until it's really chunky and I like it wanted to see [Music] okay that's perfect and now I'm going to make a white sauce that's going to be the base of the soup [Music] this white sauce is really the same kind of white sauce that makes for the lasagna I'm starting with half a stick of butter and a quarter of a cup of flour I'm going to cook it over medium low heat for about a minute just to cook the flour then I'm adding two cups of half-and-half please consider this as what happened half gets hot and it sickens with the flour so far it's been pretty easy okay the next I'm going to put in is a pureed shrimp and leeks really smells good smell the cognac and sherry that's not so much flavor the fish stock strain three-quarter cup third of a cup of tomato paste two teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and that's it it's going to start up and just let this simmer all the flavors are going to go together it's going to be rich and delicious [Music]
[Music] my friend Michael grooms having a really hectic day today so I've invited him for dinner tonight this is the time for good old-fashioned comfort food Michael actually grew up in a farm in Pennsylvania I understand as long as a fabulous cook so I know it's exactly what he's gonna want to eat I think I'll make oven fried chicken which is all crispy on the outside and juicy inside mashed potatoes with sour cream old-fashioned hearts of lettuce and tomatoes with blue cheese dressing and for dessert good old deep-dish apple pie it sounds pretty comforting to me [Music] so traditionally there are two problems with fried chicken one is all that grease i'm the second one is you have to do it just before you serve it I'm going to show you how to do it the oven solves both those problems first thing you sit it up on this little rear end take your knife and there's a backbone here that I'm gonna take out and you want to run your knife right along both sides of that backbone keep your fingers out of the way okay that's the backbone not great in fried chicken fabulous and soup so I'll save it for later so then you want to have the chicken flat out like this and there's this little part in the breastbone just want to make it with your knife and then run your fingers down both sides of this little bone and then pull it right out just should come out in one fell swoop okay and now it's really easy to cut up just run your knife right down the back flip it over cut the leg from the white meat cut the legs on the side just pull it back it's easy to see where the bones connect so I've got 8 pieces I'm ready for fried chicken now I'm gonna put all the chicken in One Bowl and I'm gonna pour buttermilk over it and it's gonna tenderize it the acid and the buttermilk really makes the chicken very tender and a poor quart of buttermilk over it this is good for two chickens but I only have one so what you want to do is get the buttermilk in them around the chicken parts okay wash up [Music] okay I'm gonna marinate this for a few hours but if you have overnight it's even better I have such a busy day today so many places to go the rain since to do the saving grace is dinner at Ines tonight all I'm gonna do is sit down and eat they're set to go [Music] in the world of comfort food I don't think there's anything more comforting or deep-dish apple pie so I've got the apples and look gorgeous from the farm and now I'm just gonna make pie crust I don't know why but I think people find pie crust more daunting than anything else that we make I'm going to show you the secret of really good pie crust and it's about very cold ingredients so I'm going to start with 3 cups of flour for the shortening there's all kinds of debates all kind of shortening to use for pie crust but I actually combine vegetable shortening and I do it very cold to consider the refrigerator and butter and then you get all of the flakiness of the vegetable shortening and all the flavor of the butter so that's a third of a cup of vegetable shortening and I've wanted to have sticks of cold butter that I've diced and I actually put it back in the refrigerator until I was ready so it's really cold put that right in and now comes the critical part what you want in the dough is little bits of butter and shortening through the dough you don't want to totally pureed and that's what makes it flaky when the heat from the oven hits the butter it causes steam to evaporate and that's what makes it really flaky so when you're doing this make sure it's not totally pureed in the flour I'm just going to pulse this about 8 times until it's like the size of peas maybe 10 times so you can still see bits of butter and shortening in the flour and that's what's gonna make really flaky pastry I'm gonna do maybe one more okay so the next thing is ice water and I need about eight tablespoons which is about 1/2 a cup so we pour out the ice excellent so I'm going to turn this on and just let it go run until it forms a ball okay we're there so now I'm gonna refrigerate it for about 30 minutes it's a really important part of making good pie pastry really careful this thing is sharp put it in the fridge for 30 minutes which gives me time to make my really old-fashioned blue cheese dressing with tomatoes and hearts of lettuce my friend Michaels having a really hard day and I thought I'd make them a very old-fashioned dinner starting with lettuce and tomato with blue cheese dressing so I have four ounces of Roquefort blue cheese 1 cup of mayonnaise this is gonna make a lot of blue cheese dressing but it's good to have around a cup of cream since the blue cheese is kind of sweet a little vinegar 2 teaspoons of tarragon vinegar are gonna give it a little bit of a bite which is good 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper how easy is that can just puree it you don't want to pureed a little chunky nice I just got a phone call from a client last-minute dinner party so she needs flowers and I'm trying to rescue her I feel like the flying doctor of flower [Music] okay now for the filling and teach - apple pie four pounds of apples cut up in big chunks and I'm gonna flavor it with a little bit of orange zest and lemon zest one tablespoon of orange juice and two tablespoons of lemon juice this not only flavors it but it keeps the apples were turning brown half a cup of sugar it all depends on how sweet the apples are these are pretty tart quarter cup of flour and teaspoon of salt I know it's surprising to put salt in a pie but it really brings out the flavor of the spices in the apples okay now for the spices three Carozza bautista the good cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon who couldn't up Meg hmm I love the way it smells smells like apple pie spice is already okay eighth of a teaspoon of allspice we're just really a pinch I'm just gonna mix it all up now if that doesn't look like old-fashioned home cooking I don't know what does I'd say this is gonna make Michael feel all better [Music] obviously these here perfect hi Peggy everything [Music] this is the key to rolling out dough is you start from the middle and work your way out I also keep it moving you don't want to roll out a perfect circle and then you can't get it up off the stone not a good idea this is a really great pie dough for any kind of pie pecan pie pumpkin pie apple pie okay that should be good so the easiest way to get into the pie plate let's take the dough roll it right up around the rolling pin and then just ease it in this is next really important step don't stretch the dough if you stretch the dough if you pull it into the pie pan when it hits the heat it's going to shrink right back so push it and sort of press it in into the form so you don't stretch it at all and just in case of tears just take a little bit of water on your fingers and press it right back together again it'll be just fine okay that's the bottom crust and then right into the crust it's a lot of apples for this pie crust but I like it when it's piled high mile high apple pie okay now for the top crust [Music] ready for the pie roll it up on the rolling pin [Music] and I'll really gently over you there's so many different ways to crimp a pie I think everybody likes to do with the way their mother did it but what I like to do is just roll the top crust underneath the bottom one I want to make this really old-fashioned looking okay once that's done you can either to crimp it with a fork crimping is about keeping the two crusts together so it seals in the juices or you can do it with your fingers I think I'll do it with my fingers yeah okay crimped now I'm gonna do an egg wash it's gonna make the crust really nice and brown which is one egg beaten with about a tablespoon of water or milk or whatever you have just brush the whole top okay a little bit of sugar make it nice and shiny and then just a few holes on the top to let the steam escape so the crust gets nice and crisp sort of old-fashioned okay into the oven 400 degrees for about an hour and hour and fifteen minutes really good with oven fried chicken and sour cream mashed potatoes time to fry the chicken so I've got my chicken there's marinating in buttermilk which is gonna make it moist and really tender it's that first thing I'm gonna season some flour to make the coating it's gonna make it really crisp 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of fresh pepper like I'm just gonna mix it all together and then put the chicken in so the secret of this recipe is instead of frying the chicken while everybody's standing there waiting for dinner I'm gonna fry it really quickly get the coating really crisp and then I'm gonna bake it in the oven so it's gonna be crisp on the outside an incredibly tender and juicy on the inside it's a messy job but really worth doing okay last piece you're really messy okay now let's get some oil really hot need the oil about 360 degrees use a candy thermometer which really save hangs on the pot think it's almost there okay chicken in just about three minutes on each side just remember where you finish cooking it in the oven they're browned on one side I want to turn them for another three minutes and then put them on a sheet pan to bake in the oven no one likes fried chicken snip for the flour I just use salt and pepper cuz I like it simple but you can always use something spicy like fan pepper whatever you like little chili powder okay three minutes ready to come out and go on the sheet then I'm gonna fry the rest of these up then I'm gonna put them all in the oven together for engine 50 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until they're incredibly crisp on the outside and really juicy inside okay they're ham can you get through Oh gotta go now that's an apple pie my favorite part is it makes the house smell fabulous so next thing I want to make is sour cream mashed potatoes I peeled them and cut them in big chunks I put them in salted boiling water for maybe about 10 to 15 minutes okay next thing I want to do is heat up a little bit of milk and butter I only have two cups of milk 6 tablespoons of butter and meanwhile I'm gonna get the potatoes pureed so this is called a food mill you can really find it in a hardware store or any kind of a cookware store and it's not very expensive so I'm just going to put the potatoes in I'll show you how this food mill work so just turn the blade and you can turn it backwards just to clean the blade and then turn it again see how light and fluffy it doesn't bother I can use any kind of boiling potatoes but Yukon Gold which are a little yellow which these are are the best ones done okay I'm just gonna whisk this into the potatoes just do it slowly don't do all of it at once want to make sure that you have enough so that's creamy but not so much that it's soupy you know a potato soup okay now for a little depth of flavor better half a cup of sour cream two teaspoons of salt [Music] really good Michael's gonna be very happy camper this is going to be really delicious without them for our chicken so all I'd love to do is plate up the salad so I've got blue cheese dressing and I'm gonna make a really nice salad so I mean traditionally this is done with a wedge of iceberg lettuce which is totally tasteless so I've taken a really nice head of lettuce just gonna take the outside leaves off save them for another salad so I think I'm just gonna cut this whole thing in I'm just gonna rinse it so there's no sand shake it out and since this piece is really too big to get into a salad spinner and you want it pretty dry I'll show you how how else to do it wrap it up into the kitchen towel and make your own salad spinner if you do this outside you won't get the kitchen so wet but it's just water okay let me get some plates I mean plates are great for a salad in it look it look terrific okay so instead of the usual sort of plastic tomatoes that you get in the grocery store I'd love to find heirloom tomato so it's sort of old fashioned see it's so much more flavor so few Tomatoes the bigger ones cut in half or quarters just an assortment of yellow and orange and green tomatoes and blue cheese dressing and I'd be all ready when Michael gets you [Music] are you gonna be happy just like your mother's cooking oven fried chicken sour cream mashed potatoes and to start blue cheese salad with heirloom tomatoes yes [Music] perfect [Music] first piece in my house smells wonderful but cooked apples and nutmeg and cinnamon I could smell the orange zest and lemon zest I don't know anything a little vanilla ice cream doesn't improve [Music] [Music]

every Wednesday my friends come for bridge and just when they think they're gonna get chips and dip I'm gonna Surprise them with a fabulous finger food meal served with delicious content so what I thought would be fun is to do a dinner menu but in bite-size pieces so we can play cards and have dinner at the same time so I'm making vegetable sushi it's the vegetable course and then lobster salad and Eve leaves that's the fish course sausage and puff pastry is the meat course and then for dessert because you always have to have dessert I'm going to do mini Linzer cookies that'll be really good so watch how great this is first thing is a sushi rolling mat which is a little bamboo mat you can buy in any kind of a grocery or specialty store and the next thing is these nori rolls which is seaweed I'll show you what these guys look like it's a very thin sheet of seaweed and it has one shiny side and one dull side and it's the shiny side that goes down on the bamboo roller and then I'm gonna moisten it with a little bit of rice wine vinegar just to soften it up a little bit I know this seems like a lot of unusual ingredients but they usually all together on the grocery shelf okay that's it now the next thing I have cooked sushi rice what you really just steamed until it's cooked and then I'm going to put about a cup and a quarter on each roll okay so I'm gonna wet my fingers the best way to do it okay watch this so Pat it out in a thin layer to the end of the edges but you want to leave this edge at the top and the bottom free because that's going to keep it stuck together when we roll it up okay now some flavorings this is the key thing this is wasabi it's really hot all by itself it's like horseradish but what you do is mix it with water it's still really hot but it flavors this and you just want to put a little bit of wasabi down the middle of this just to flavor it you want to put just a tiny bit on otherwise you blow your friends out of their seats okay that's that and then I'm going to put some red onions right down the middle like this I'm going to put all the vegetables in one line and then you'll see how they all roll up together look gorgeous okay so the first thing I put on is some cucumber right straight across and red pepper just run it right down the middle of this you'll see this all going to be in a bundle and it's a little gorgeous when it's done and yellow pepper and scallion that I've julienned for flavor and color and then very long thin piece of carrot and then for flavor pickled ginger which I'll show you what this is it's really good they're very thin slices of fresh ginger that have been pickled and it really gives it lots of flavor now comes the fun part I'm going to roll this whole thing up so you take the bamboo mat and just pull the nori the black nori right up over this bundle and then just keep pulling the mat and allowing it to roll through this pressing really hard so it sticks and you want to make sure that there's an edge here and then you just press it so it's nice and tight and voila we have sushi so what I'm going to do is chill this and then I'll slice the ends off and then serve it with sushi dipping sauce it's going to be really good with the party so that's the first one I'm going to make a few more you know you really shouldn't be scared of trying this I was terrified the first time I could eat roll into thin slices of sushi so they'll make about nine each okay those are ready so now I just need a little sushi dipping sauce I'm going to slice the sushi and then we'll have a little sauce to dip it in so first thing is half a teaspoon of this incredibly hot wasabi powder so be careful not to put more than half a teaspoon in and a half a teaspoon of water and that's really just to make a paste out of it you just mix these together it's gonna turn green sort of a great sage green color and then to give it more heat 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes as though it's not hot enough a teaspoon of chopped pickled ginger teaspoon of chopped scallions this is not just gonna give it flavor but it's gonna make it look good too 1/4 cup of wine vinegar 3 tablespoons of soy sauce use good soy sauce cuz it really makes a difference it has lots of flavor and I have a teaspoon of sesame oil you want to use the toasted sesame oil that really smells like sesame oil some of them are just clear I'm just gonna whisk that together and that's it so I'm gonna put this in the fridge and then I'm going shopping do these gorgeous little clams would be great for clam chowder but today I'm here for lobster meat and in the life's too short category I'm never gonna cook a lobster if the seafood shop is gonna do it for me so Cullen I need about a pound of fresh lobster meat oh this is gorgeous beautiful we cook the precious more let's go get fresh in the morning we do if I were gonna make cook a lobster myself how many lobsters what I need for a pound of meat believe it or not you need about four Lobster really for lobsters the other don't so glad you're cooking it for me that might be about enough okay perfect that's great so my friends are coming for bridge and I'm sure they're expecting pretzels potato chips I'm gonna Surprise them with a full meal and it's all gonna be finger food so we can play bridge and eat at the same time so what I'm gonna make now is lobster salad in and Eve leaves it's a little luxurious but they deserve it so I've got a pound of lobster that I've gotten actually already cooked it's a particular lecture to be able to do that but I'd have to cook four lobsters in order to get a pound of lobster meat so so much trouble so I just have to chop this up into bite-sized pieces okay into the ball then I'm gonna get about 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise use good mayonnaise it's really worth it 1/2 a cup of chopped celery a tablespoon of capers drain the liquid out because you don't want it too vinegary lots of fresh dill so I'm just going to run my knife on the head don't pick all those a little leaves off it's too time-consuming and just roughly chopped it doesn't have to be so finely chopped that you can't see the dill in the salad I think it's good one you know exactly what you're eating love dill with seafood okay fresh dill and salt and pepper just to season it lightly some freshly ground black pepper and then toss it together how easy is that let's make sure this tastes perfect I'm so good could you really taste the lobster so for dessert for my card friends I'm gonna make Linzer cookies well then a really traditional Linzer cookies they're shortbread cookies with raspberry jam in the middle so in here I have 3/4 of a pound of butter cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla and I'm just going to add the flour and salt need three half cups of flour that's one three and then just a half that's pretty close a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt then I sift it all together not only combines the salt in the flour but it makes sure if there any little hard pieces in the flour it gets sifted out great then with the mixer on low just add the flour into the butter and sugar mixture okay one good mix of the spatula am i wearing it not yet and then mix on low speed until it just really pulls together as a dough and that's it so clear the decks a little bit of flour on the board dump it out on the board clunk we're just going to pull it together with my hands don't worry about using too much flour in the board just make sure it doesn't stick it's gonna Pat this out into a nice round disc chill it for 15 minutes and then roll it out into cookies with playing card motifs it's gonna be really good and into the fridge for party I think we're all so set on having cocktails in the living room dinner in the dining room breakfast in the kitchen it's just really boring I love to shake it up a little bit so what it does I brought my kitchen table into the living room and the kitchen chairs nice and comfy for bridge and I brought a table from the entryway I'm gonna set up all the food and the drinks right here gives me an opportunity to walk around see everybody's cards no I really don't do that then I have these great napkins a friend gave me they've got cards on them they're a little Kitsch but I think they're really fun so the rooms all set and we're gonna have a good time now for the fun part of the winds are cooking blowing the mouth always feels like play-doh to me so I have my chilled just want to make sure it keeps moving on the board so what I'm gonna do is cut out small rounds as the bottom of the cookie and then I'm gonna put the top on with a cutout and you can see the raspberry jam that's in the middle it's gonna look good it's gonna taste good so a little bit of flour on the board just make sure the colors well floured I'm going to put it on a baking sheet with parchment paper so it doesn't stick I'm going to cut it about 12 rounds the good thing about this dough is after you cut out the rounds you can roll the rest of it up in a ball and keep cutting them out I okay last one so now what I'm going to do is I have this little Club cutout that I'm going to cut the top of the cookie with just like a playing card I have hearts spades diamonds and clubs so each of the tops of these cookie is going to have a cutout so the bottom of the cookie is going to have raspberry jam and then when we put the top on you'll see the raspberry jam in the cutout it's going to be great and then I'll put a little bit of powdered sugar on the top of the cookie hearts and finally spades so I'm going to chill these for about 15 minutes and then bake them at 350 for about 10 to 15 minutes and then fill them with raspberry jam they're gonna be so good so my card chart friends are coming to play bridge with me and I'm making an entire meal all in finger food a vegetable sushi lobster salad on deep leaves and I'm making sausage and puff pastry so I've got one sheet of puff pastry and then I'm going to brush it with some Dijon mustard give it lots of flavor leave the edge free so when you wrap it up it'll stick put mustard on both sheets so the next thing I'm going to do is take a piece of lamb sausage that I've already cooked and just put it right down on top of the puff pastry and then roll the pastry up around the sausage this is so easy when you have puff pastry already made I'm going to take a little bit of this egg wash which is egg mixed with water and milk whatever you have just to seal the edge and right onto a baking sheet on the second one the good thing about this is you can really make it in advance and leave it unbaked in the refrigerator and just bake it off just before the party little bit of egg wash on the top make sure it comes out nice and brown then I'm just going to score it into individual pieces so when it comes out hot I'll know where to cut it so seven pieces perfect into the oven 400 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes and then I'll slice it and serve it with mustard it's gonna be good we're having dinner we have to have cocktails I'm gonna make a really easy drink for my card party it's called a lemon drop first ingredient is vodka that's the key two cups of vodka I find a much more successful at Bridge at the opponents drink a lot of vodka two cups of vodka half a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice quarter of a cup of superfine sugar let's get together and I'm gonna add some lemon to it and then I'm gonna serve them in martini glasses and that's it and I'm ready for a party so I've done all the cooking and now I'm going to do the assembling these are the Linzer cookies I'm gonna put a little bit of raspberry jam on the bottoms and then put the tops on with powdered sugar see it looks great okay now we're going to take a little bit of powdered sugar so we'll just dust powdered sugar on the top of these cutouts you'll see when it goes on the raspberry jam it looks great diamonds clubs and a diamond and a heart I'm the last ones for me make sure they're good mmm so good cookies buttery and the raspberry jam sweet my friends are gonna love them Club diamond heart it was babe it's all there it's party time my bridge friends are coming in about 15 minutes and I just have a few things to get ready before they get here so the first thing is lamb sausage and puff pastry and all I have to do is to slice this how gorgeous it is it's nice and hot it's a great thing to make early because it can really sit in the refrigerator and then just bake it off before the party I'm gonna serve this with a little dish of Dijon mustard it's gonna be great okay the next thing is vegetable sushi these sushi rolls that I've done and also these are great to do in advance with sushi rice and vegetables inside okay this goes right on the dish and then I'm gonna serve it with this dipping sauce which is like a soy and ginger marinade with all kinds of good flavors in it now that's all done now finish off the lobster salad so the last thing to assemble is the lobster salad on deep leaves so the Antibes is great it's actually like this little cup I just cut off each leaf from the stem I love when my friends come they come every week and we have a really good time so we'll just put a little bit of lobster salad in each of these little on deed cups and then it's finger food can actually do this with crab meat and shrimp salad I think lobster sounds special and just a little fresh dill for garnish I'm ready for bridge party if you've had as many lemon drops as I have you're in trouble goodies for everybody we have vegetable sushi I'll get more snacks and you can deal you know good good oh good everything's we're gonna have to throw the cards at how am i doing for weekly Wiggly bridge game may always in the spirit and boom at and just pull the nori the black nori right up over this bundle and then just keep pulling the mat and allowing it to roll through this pressing really hard so it sticks and you want to make sure that there's an edge here and then you just press it so it's nice and tight and voila we have sushi so what I'm going to do is chill this and then I'll slice the ends off and then serve it with sushi dipping sauce it's gonna be really good with the party so that's the first one I'm gonna make a few more I have cooked sushi rice what you really just steamed until it's cooked and then I'm going to put about a cup and a quarter on each roll okay so on wet my fingers the best way to do it okay watch this so pet it out in a thin layer to the end of the edges but you want to leave this edge at the top and the bottom free because that's going to keep it stuck together when we roll it up okay now some flavorings this is the key thing this is wasabi it's really hot all by itself it's like horseradish but what you do is mix it with water it's still really hot but it flavors this and you just want to put a little bit of wasabi down the middle of this just to flavor it you want to put just a tiny bit on otherwise you blow your friends out of their seeds every Wednesday my friends come for bridge and just when they think they're going to get chips and dip I'm gonna Surprise them with a fabulous finger food meal serve with delicious content so what I thought would be fun is to do a dinner menu but in bite-size pieces so in play cards and have dinner at the same time so I'm making vegetable sushi it's the vegetable course and then lobster salad and Eve leaves that's the fish course sausage and puff pastry is the meat course and then for dessert because you always have to have dessert I'm going to do mini Linzer cookies that'd be really good so watch how great this is first thing is a sushi rolling mat which is a little bamboo mat you can buy in any kind of a grocery or specialty store and the next thing is these nori rolls or just seaweed I'll show you what these guys look like it's a very thin sheet of seaweed and it has one shiny side and one dull side and it's the shiny side that goes down on the bamboo roller and then I'm going to moisten it with a little bit of rice wine vinegar just to soften it up a little bit I know this seems like a lot of unusual ingredients but they usually all together on the grocery shelf okay that's it now the next thing okay that's that and then I'm going to put some red onions right down the middle like this I'm going to put all the vegetables in one line and then you'll see how they all roll up together look gorgeous okay so the first thing I put on is some cucumber right straight across and red pepper just run it right down the middle of this you'll see this all going to be in a bundle and it's a little gorgeous when it's done and yellow pepper and scallion that I've julienned for flavor and color and then very long thin piece of carrot and then for flavor pickled ginger which I'll show you what this is it's really good they're very thin slices of fresh ginger that had been pickled and it really gives it lots of flavor now comes the fun part I'm going to roll this whole thing up so you take the bit
I'm building a barn in my garden with a working kitchen and I love my architect where is he thank you to his whole team and I thought what better way than to make them a wonderful lunch okay so lobster paella I'm going to turn it up to 425 and I want to show you how I make really easy paella I actually used to avoid this because it was so complicated I thought what am I going to bother making a big pot of things we have to cook everything individually so I decided I would make it with lots of things I already cooked and I'll show you how easy it is so first a quarter of a cup of oil and I'm going to chop up some onions that wanted to have cups of onions so the first thing I did was I started on the cooktop but then I do most of the cooking in the oven so I'm not always standing over a hot pot and the second thing is instead of cooking each individual thing differently it has shrimp that has chicken and has sausage I decided I'm going to use all things that are cooked like cook cabassa cooked lobster I decide to make it really special I mentioned was the classic Spanish dish where you use that bowl the leftovers okay so saute those for about five minutes the meantime I'm going to cut up some red peppers so in order to julienne pepper so they're really nice-looking just going to cut straight down and then save that later for snack and then just julienne about half inch strips that's a great dish to make when you're serving a crowd it's great to make in large quantities and you don't have to serve it the minute it gets out of the oven okay how the onions doing they're just starting to get a little translucent and put the peppers in and let them cook for about five minutes just want to get the most flavor out of what you put in this is all going to flavor the right and then later I'm going to add all kinds of delicious things to it put it in the oven okay the next thing is garlic I like lots of garlic so I'm going to use like four or five cloves of garlic this can actually be a very inexpensive dish to make if you make it with cooked mussels and clams but I'm going to make a special one today for the architect with lobster okay so about two tablespoons of garlic just put it in cook this for about a minute so the garlic doesn't burn okay next with the right two cups of rice traditionally the Spanish use a short grain rice or a medium grain rice for this I like basmati rice I think it's really firm it's that great flavor so two cups of basmati rice and five cups of chicken stock you can use can stock but I really prefer homemade okay Nets and great spices 1/2 teaspoon of saffron which is actually amazingly the stamens of crocuses huge in collecting them and it's a seasoned it and it's going to give a great yellow color half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes give it a little heat not too so much that you can't taste the rest of the ingredients 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of fennel [Music] okay just give it a big stir let it come to a simmer put the lid on put the whole thing in the oven for 25 to 15 minutes oh my goodness that's a lot of Paia it's all the rice and the saffron and peppers and onions garlic it's going to be fantastic I just have a few things I want to add to it the first thing is some Perrineau which is anise flavored wine will occur it's just going to give it a nice fennel flavor so I need 1/3 of a cup turn the heat on a little bit so all the liquids absorbed it can really smell the saffron and garlic fantastic and this is the trick for really easy pie things that are already cooked because the first thing I have is 1/2 1/2 pounds of cooked lobster meat this big chunky pieces it's a high and low heat a little more expensive to buy it already crust but certainly a huge difference in time just going to turn the heat off so the lobster doesn't cook anymore just scheme and then I would like to do some kind of sausage but since cabassa has already cooked always use that you can really find cabassa in any kind of a really traditional Italian or it's Polish sausage but any kind of it Adelie I'm going to put in a pound of kielbasa just nice big slices so you can really see it okay that goes in okay and now another secret is frozen peas so all we're going to do really is put them in the hot rice and they're going to defrost that's one 10 ounce package of frozen peas I'm just going to mix it all in looks amazing all the saffron rice and lobster kielbasa peppers just kind of fabulous and put the lid on and steam it for about 15 minutes and then I'm going to serve it with lots of parsley and big chunks of lemon and lunch is ready [Music]
[Music] in 1966 truman capote was the literary toast of america when he decided to give a black and white ball at the Plaza Hotel everybody who was anybody wanted to be invited my friend Deborah Davis has written a fabulous book about that party called party of the century she and her husband are coming for dinner tonight I thought wouldn't it be fun to serve a dinner that was inspired by that party Truman Capote looked chicken hash and he surprised everyone by serving it for dinner so I'm doing the same thing then in keeping with a down-home theme I'm making pan perdu which is french toast for dessert and with coffee melt in the mouth white truffles place with Irish Cream Liqueur everyone came dressed to the nines for Truman Capote's party we're dressing down but I hope it's gonna be just as much fun a Truman Capote's party everybody were these fabulous black and white outfits and they actually even had black and white masks with feathers and all kinds of things that must have been amazing the food wasn't black and white but I thought I'd be fun to make black and white truffles for dessert so I'm gonna start with quarter cup of heavy cream and then pour it into a BAM array which is a heatproof bowl set over boiling water want to make sure the water doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl it keeps it from getting too hot I'm just gonna heat that up meanwhile I'm gonna chop seven ounces of white chocolate it's really a vanilla flavored chocolate and I think it's delicious I put the chocolate in and let that melt with a heavy cream actually want to keep the water simmering you don't want it boiling so it doesn't get too hot and burn the chocolate I'm just gonna let that melt and then I'm gonna add some other flavorings actually I take it off just before it's all melted and the heat just continues to melt the chocolate okay I'd say that's good see that's pretty quick and just let the chocolate continue to melt until it's totally smooth truffles are actually surprisingly easy to make and they're so special people think you've worked for days and I'm gonna add two things I'm gonna add Irish Cream Liqueur two tablespoons both look at wonderful balance you can really flavor it with whatever you like but you wanted something delicate so that it doesn't overpower the chocolate and a half a teaspoon of vanilla just whisk that in I'm just gonna chill this in the refrigerator it'll take about an hour until the white chocolate is really firm and I can roll it into round balls and then we'll have black and white truffles for our black and white party [Music] so in keeping with a black and white theme I thought I'd get black and white tablecloth but of course I couldn't find one so I just went to the fabric store and bought yards of fabric and made my own simple white roses and since it was a masked ball and a black and white feathered mask for Deborah so while I was setting the table the chocolate got nicely chilled for the white truffles and I'm just I like to use a little scoop like this a tiny ice-cream scoop and it's just perfect for making round balls and they all come out even just roll them around a little bit they shouldn't be perfect they should look like those truffles that the pigs find the real mushroom truffles so I'm gonna drizzle some with dark chocolate and roll some in hazelnuts [Music] just be great for coffee but not so good as gifts if you want to do a little hostess guess they're a wonderful thing they keep really well keep them in the refrigerator and you always want to serve them at room temperature so they just melt in your mouth okay [Music] into the fridge to set for a few minutes while I get the toppings ready [Music] [Music] I'm just going to slowly let this chocolate melt these six ounces of bittersweet chocolate I thought it'd be nice because the white chocolates so sweet I thought the bittersweet chocolate would be really nice you want to really smooth and not so hot that it breaks [Music] it's after everything ready to decorate my black and white truffles now comes the tricky part drizzling the chocolate I think I'll do half in chocolate and half on the toasted hazelnuts just drizzle it with a little spoon just like that looks like French truffles will go both ways if you like be creative okay so that's half them with chocolate and the other half I'm gonna do and tested has lots came out of the oven they're cool now I'm just gonna take each one and just roll it in toasted hazelnuts I mean I'm doing a black and white party but you can actually do these truffles than anything cocoa powder toasted coconut it's wonderful or do dark chocolate truffles with white chocolate drizzle on them these look really good I'm gonna refrigerate them and then serve them at room temperature and next I'm gonna make a very down-home French sir I Truman Capote's ball he not only served dinner but after hours of dancing Elsa serve breakfast so I thought it'd be really fun to do a breakfast dish for dessert which is pampered ooh it's french toast and it served as a sweet dessert a little Grand Marnier and fresh strawberries so the first thing I'm going to do is marinate some fresh strawberries and then I'm going to serve it later after I make the pan perdu it's one of the few things that I do they have to make it the last minute it's really worth it it's so good so you better have to find a fresh strawberry just slice them you really want to have good strawberries so when you slice them make you smell fresh strawberry want apples for the sugar and 1 tablespoon of orange summer and those are just gonna macerate together and the triggers gonna bring some of the juices of the strawberries out and make a wonderful like a syrup it was so good with an amp hairdo and now I'm off to I econo to get chicken for my chicken hash you know a lot of people think of East Hampton is big mansions on the beach and while that's true my East Hampton really is about the farmers and the fisherman people who grow things on the land and it's a very earthy place it's been that way since 1640 when it was founded and it's just wonderful [Music] mr. icon how are you is that for me that's for you oh that was gorgeous oh that's so nice thank you that's perfect great special just love it here I've actually asked mr. okona for two chickens quarter we're gonna use the light meat for the chicken hash I'm gonna save the dark meat for another time thank you thank you [Music] chicken legs in the freezer for another day so Truman Capote's all-time favorite dish was chicken hash so that's what he decided he was gonna serve his black and white ball and love the idea of it something very very lowbrow for some very fancy people so I don't know what his is like but I'm gonna make my version of chicken hash so just pull up the skin and take the fresh basil leaves whole and just put them right under the skin it's gonna give the chicken really good flavor of course you can do this with a roast chicken from the grocery store but I think this will have much more flavor not the sheet pan with olive oil let's try to put the salt pepper okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and this is gorgeous basil chicken - the chicken - okay cannot chicken hatch without potatoes it's the base Brown crusty wonderful potatoes so you want to choose boiling potatoes not baking potatoes because they have better texture I'm just going to kill them I think if you wanted it to be very earthy you could do them without peeling them but I think for this it's a special dinner I'm gonna make him perfect so I have about one and a half or two pounds of potatoes okay that's our peeled so now what I really do is I'm gonna dice them about half inch dice so I want them big enough so they're distinctive but not so big that they won't cook quickly that should do it like that it's particularly appropriate because truman capote and his later years used to live here he was quite the local character okay that's the potatoes now I'm gonna do the onions you can use either red onion or white onion I find that red onions a little sweeter so I'm gonna saute these potatoes and onions and big pan with lots of butter until they're nice and crispy and brown I wonder how different this is from Truman Capote's - probably not a lot it's so much easier to chop onions if you leave the root intact it doesn't go flying all over the board or the kitchen okay so I'm gonna put some butter in the pan and saute the onions and potatoes into the really brown and crusty and then add chicken and peppers it's going to be so delicious it's time to cook the chicken hash okay my names into the pan want a really big pan for this because you want a lot of surface for the potatoes and onions get really brown and crusty okay big spoon just all the potatoes coated with a little bit of butter okay I'm gonna put that on medium heat and just let that really get gorgeous the meantime and then do the peppers and garlic a little bit of butter in this case I'm not mixing butter and oil because the butter really Browns better and two red peppers I'm actually doing these separately because I don't want the moisture in the peppers to stop the potatoes from browning and some fresh thyme I have like this is an exact recipe just sort of throwing everything in that you think would be good okay lots of garlic it's gonna give it good flavor and lots of salt and pepper both the potatoes and the peppers if you've seasoned things while you're cooking it gets really well-seasoned into the middle of it if you season at the end it just tastes salty similar things so the pre-k for the flavor answer the peppers I bet tablespoon of tomato paste with a lot of flavor that's why I like to cook the potatoes and the peppers separately the peppers are done way before the potatoes this way you can make sure that they both cook perfectly okay go turn this off so next with a chicken so this is the roasted basil chicken behind the head it's gorgeous but I just cube it up remove the wings snacks for Jeffrey and then just take the chicken off the bone I might actually leave the skin on cuz it's got a lot of the flavor and the basil I'm just cutting the chicken in one-inch chunks so that they're big pieces you really have a sense that the chicken is in it [Music] okay let me see how that potatoes are doing really browning beautifully look how good those look smell great [Music] see if one of them is done perfect it's done but firm I'm going to turn it off I'm just going to put the chicken in so good no wonder Truman Capote served this to his guests they must be delighted the chicken in and the peppers [Music] move how good does this look okay we're gonna pass some scallions and parsley okay Scott Ian's into the dish lots of fresh parsley turn it on and heat it through [Music] and may not be breakfast at tiffany's but it's definitely dinner at - big platter and a new surprise and make the dinner inspired by the dinner the Truman head at the black and white wall so it's chicken hash let me see you in your mouth oh that's so [Music] I just love is that just what everybody thought that they were gonna have a really fancy food you need very earthy food that appeals to be enormous I'm not sure Capote my literary skills are lacking what you see what I have for dessert it's a treat for breakfast something sweet yeah bye Newell sweet [Music] okay I'm breaking all my rules I always said never make something while the guests are here but these are really good friends and this is really good pintor do now we're gonna make the mixture 6 eggs 1/2 cups of milk and because it's dessert put a little sweetness in it 1 tablespoon of sugar 2 tablespoons of original occur it's the same one I used in the strawberries 2 tablespoons of honey one minute teaspoons of good vanilla with half the tablespoon one tablespoon of orange zest and a teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor the orange is in the honey whisk it all together now I'm gonna pour it in here so I can soak the bread I don't use a hollow which is a wonderful egg bread all these guys are so if you want to get a nice hot pan with some butter for sauteing well this looks great you can see the orange in it good messy okay these bright slices isn't so beautifully they're just wonderful I'm going to dip them in almonds and then place them in the pan almond side down so the toasted almonds get even more Brown let's mess up right here on the pan [Music] okay you might be ready to turn perfect oh no a three [Music] one slice per person lots of fresh strawberries marinated Grand Marnier okay perfect little dusting of confectioner's sugar and u-turn breakfast into dessert pan perdu or french toast for dessert would be so so fantastic fantastic this has been a wonderful meal thank you just when you think you which one should I go for first well they're both white chocolate and these have dark chocolate on them and those have [Laughter] [Music]
[Music] Antonia Bellanca and I have been dear friends for decades she's coming today with her gorgeous daughter Tess who at 14 years old is already a professional Baker Tess and I have actually been baking together since she was five I like to think I had a little influence on her for dinner I'm making fresh crab cakes that are packed with flavor and instead of the usual coleslaw a French celery root remoulade then for dessert I'm getting ingredients ready for a lemon meringue tart so Tess and I can pipe the meringue topping together I'm always in the kitchen cooking on my own I'm so excited to have Test cooking with me and hey I might even send her home with a new baking skill my friends Antonian test live in Cape Cod and I thought it'd be great to make crab cakes for dinner make them feel right at home so I'm gonna saute them in butter and oil the key to crab cakes is lots of flavor I don't like crab cakes that are just like crab and mayonnaise it has to have lots of flavor and I do it by having wonderful vegetables so what I'm going to do is saute all these vegetables the other thing about crab cakes since the crab is quite expensive this really makes it go much further so I'm just gonna put these in the oil and butter I've got about 3/4 of a cup of red onion we're gonna 1/2 cups of celery half a cup of yellow peppers sweet yellow peppers and I got a half a cup of red peppers I'd really prefer red and yellow peppers I think they're sweeter than green peppers I just saute those for about 15 minutes until they're really just tender and be colorful and flavorful okay now I need some parsley 1/4 cup of chopped parsley a rough chop is just fine doesn't have to be the most perfect chopped parsley in the world okay that's about quarter of a cup mmm no more flavors I need tablespoon of capers want drained capers you don't want the liquid in it half a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce quarter of a teaspoon of Tabasco give it a little heat and why don't have teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning which is a great sort of crabcakes seasoning mixture you can really find anywhere in a grocery store salt and pepper can never forget salt and pepper that half a teaspoon of each I'm just gonna cook this for about 10 minutes until the vegetables are really tender I'm gonna add the crabmeat and lots of other good stuff [Music] [Applause] so with the crabcakes it's really traditional in my coleslaw but I thought it'd be much better to make celery remoulade but summer wood is that big ugly knob is a kind of celery not the kind we usually get it's kind of bitter and you can see the sort of stalks but it's grown just for the root and has a really fresh sort of celery like flavor so it's but it's a tough root as you can see cutting it so what I'm doing is I'm going to shred it so that the course grading yes you see how fast this is when you do it this way much easier than doing by hand just have to cut these so that the fit in the feed tube if you press on the top things maybe that a course are great which is terrific last piece if you have a little piece left over you can always grade it by hand so that was about a two pound celery root I actually love celery where it's great with mashed potatoes and Gretchen's got a really fresh flavor so I'm just gonna add some salt to this about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons and some fresh lemon juice and that'll keep it from turning brown and sort of marinated a little bit which is great 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and just let it sit while I make the sauce so I need mustard and vinegar when I use mustard I often use two of them like Dijon mustard because it's got real punch and I like coarse grain mustard because I like the texture and it looks like mustard and ooh champagne vinegar but any good white wine vinegar will be just fine okay necklace sauce really easy we do a cup of mayonnaise I was like when mayonnaise is thin with lots of other flavorings so just now that sort of thick texture but it also has lots of flavor of Dijon mustard a tablespoon of course mustard about two teaspoons of the vinegar to get a little see how great this looks it looks like it's yellow with mustard but also the coarse mustard really gives it the texture I think a little bit of lemon juice better tablespoon so now the sauce is already okay just pour enough sauce over it I always have extra sauce because sometimes it gets dry as it sits pour enough sauce over salt and pepper mix it together oh this is gonna be delicious I love celery root lemon juice and mustard together a little more sauce okay this is nicely mixed who's gonna refrigerate it nicely delicious with the crab cakes which I want to finish next [Music] time to mix up the crabcakes let's start with a half a pound of crab meat instead of picking the crabs just buy it like this it's really good make sure it's fresh if you can rather than frozen always better fantastic this looks really beautiful lump crabmeat just check and make sure there are no little sort of shells in it crab cakes are so great for kids I know a lot of kids that won't he broiled halibut but they all like crab cakes so I'm gonna put in all the sauteed vegetables that we've made earlier all the celery and red peppers yellow peppers and red onion is going to be so much flavor and then 1/2 a cup of breadcrumbs just plain breadcrumbs or crying mayonnaise which binds it all together two eggs which also have find it together [Music] fit them lightly right now two teaspoons of good Dijon mustard and just mix it up I think what I want to do it'd be fun for tests to make these crab cakes with when you sound school at this chill in the fridge get nice and firm and then testing on saute them together okay that's nicely nice just looks great okay into the fridge chill for 30 minutes but I think I'm gonna go by Tessa gift she's a fabulous Baker [Music] so for dessert Tess and I are gonna make a lemon meringue tart if I'd be really nice to buy our piping set which is an amazing Baker and I bet she doesn't have a set like this so these are large tips I think it looks really great to do large ones and I'm gonna get a piping bag and you can type the meringue together free pie i Cathy [Music] five [Music] I take it down look absolutely I love lemon meringue pie and I thought it'd be really nice to make it a little fancier for my friends Antoni and Tess so I'm gonna make a lemon meringue tart so the first thing I need is one stick of butter one and a half cups of sugar [Music] so I'm going to cream those together and separate four eggs [Music] you scrape it down add the egg yolks and then I'm gonna reserve the egg whites for the meringue later that's on low speed and I'm going to add four whole eggs just get that in until it's incorporated get 3/4 of a cup of fresh lemon juice accord of a cup of the lemon zest that i zested before and that's gonna make it taste so good and a teaspoon of salt just a pinch it's gonna it's gonna look curdled don't get nervous it's the way it's supposed to look okay the lemon zest is what's gonna give it so much flavor [Music] okay I'm just gonna cook it for about eight to ten

[Music] creme brulee is the ultimate guide dessert naked and he'll follow you anywhere but tonight a magnet for my girlfriend's creme brulee is this incredible creamy custard hard caramelized top absolutely delicious the three cups of cream can't make creme to live in that creme and I'm going to scald it which means it's not going to boil but they're going to be little bubbles all the way around the outside and it's just under boiling so I need one whole egg into the mixer fitted with a paddle attachment which is what this is and then you pour egg yolk half a cup of sugar just going to turn the mixer on low and mix them just until they're combined you don't want to need frothy whippy stuff just until they're combined just like that and then I'm going to add the scalded milk so I'm just going to pour it really slowly into the eggs don't want scrambled eggs beginning moves like creme really just looks like a great custard so I'm just going to flavor it with two things vanilla 1 teaspoon love vanilla my favor and 1 tablespoon of Grand Marnier she's really orange flavored liqueur and or whatever kind of look her you have around the house don't buy a whole bottle just for one tablespoon perfect then I put it into five ramekins or for my friends and I one extra for Jeffrey when he comes home it's the guy dessert thing perfect a [Music] water bath will ensure that the custards could even pitcher really helps it's just about halfway up the sides of the dishes so do for the oven 300 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and then I'm going to chill the custard and my friends and I are going to blowtorch the caramelized sugar together that's going to be fun boy have I got a treat for you there vanilla custard but they might have a little Grand Marnier ma and how about if we brulee the top the burnt sugar I'll show you how so in take a tablespoon of sugar and just put right on the top of the cold custard and actually if you need to take your finger and run it along the top of that just to smooth it out to get it all the way and this is the fun part so this is a little kitchen torch so you turn it on watch that understand my dad dangerous okay you want it nice and high keep your hand away and you just hold it right down on the sugar and it'll burn it get under the blow torch you can actually do it in the broiler but I just think it comes out much better this way and it's so much more fun okay that's their job excellent well done everybody whoo
[Music] Geoffrey's coming home tonight really late from a long trip so I'm not gonna be able to make as usual friday-night roast chicken so instead I'm gonna make him some really good hot chocolate before it goes to bed tonight and tomorrow I'm gonna surprise him with a fabulous breakfast I'm making buttery brioche warm from the oven with homemade strawberry jam fresh fruit crunch with yogurt and granola topping and fresh peach Bellinis I always say I don't want to cook for him I'm sure somebody else would be very happy to do it for me I'm not taking any chances I know this sounds like a daunting thing to make but I'm gonna make strawberry jam and you won't believe how easy it is so what I have in the pot here is I've heated it very very slowly is one and a half cups of sugar the juice of a lemon and the zest of a lemon I'd love to use the zest it has lots of flavor and I've heated it really slowly so it doesn't burn and the lemon juice is great because not only to flavor it but has pectin it so it's gonna have a gel okay now we're gonna add the good stuff the strawberries you want to pick strawberries that smell really good and these are really ripe strawberries okay so I'm just take the hull out cut these guys in half it's a wonderful thing to do in strawberry season when the strawberries are particularly lovely but in the United States California strawberries are really good all the time this is gonna make probably about two pints we're just gonna be great we'll have one for breakfast minutes and Jeffrey back with some and put all the strawberries into the sugar carefully it's ha ha and just give it a stir and just bring the heat up just a smidge and in about 15 or 20 minutes strawberry jam so while that's cooking I'm gonna start the brioche who wouldn't like that for breakfast strawberry jam homemade strawberry jam and brioche so brioche bread it's really like a tasty bread I want to start with a half a cup of very warm water it has to be about 110 120 degrees when it's in the ball so you want to start out with water that's hotter than that cuz the ball is always cold one package of yeast of dry yeast it's about 2 teaspoons and 3 tablespoons of sugar just to have the yeast grow so yeast meets food and warmth to activate it so the heat of the water is the warmth and the sugar as the food okay swish around with your hands as you can feel it's not dissolved next I need six eggs as I said this is an egg bread just a great richness I'm gonna put this in and then mix them for about a minute on medium speed okay when the lower the speed to low we've put in two cups of flour just put it in slowly so doesn't get lumpy trying to get it all in and split up on the counter and two and a half teaspoons of salt I actually put the flour in first an assault second because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and it sort of buffers it okay I'm just gonna scrape down the sides make sure it's well mixed it's a very soft mixture right now and leave it on medium speed for about five minutes meanwhile I'm gonna test the jam plate in the freezer just a little bit of the jam just put it right on the plate let it sit there for a minute roll it around and as it chills you can see it this is gonna be perfect it's jelly okay into the jars be careful that Sam's really have what it looks particularly at this Jam you can still see a whole story [Music] yours is looking good okay now I've put a two and a quarter cups of flour it's a little bit of a process but it's really not hard I can just turn on low our [Music] just turn up to medium for about five minutes just enough time for me to make a label for my champ like a gym would be ever so slightly more special if I did a label with Geoffrey's name on [Music] and then I think I'll make a little hot chocolate - good for Jeffrey let's comment so Geoffrey's coming home soon and the brioche that I'm making him is pretty good now and I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator to rise overnight and then I'll bake it off tomorrow morning so be hot the brioche in the morning boy is he gonna be pleased I'm just gonna make a ball this ball has been buttered so when I take the brioche out it won't stick to it like everything else okay I'm gonna cover it with plastic wrap and into the fridge overnight and then tomorrow I'm gonna put it into little cups and make an individual brioche so Jeffrey's on his way home he should be home any minute and since I'm sure he's had some horrible dinner on the road I thought I'd make him something I can feel good hot chocolate two and a half cups of milk two cups of half-and-half this is a rich hot chocolate I mean the truth is you can probably buy a powder and make it really easily but nothing tastes as good as the real thing this makes a lot of hot chocolate about five cups and turn the heat on and just heat that up until it's simmering and I'm gonna add all the chocolate so I have two types of chocolate four ounces of milk chocolate and also four ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chocolate chips are finally if you have good chocolate it's even better tablespoon of sugar teaspoon of vanilla extract and because it always gives chocolate a real depth of flavor a teaspoon of instant coffee powder because it's night time I'm using decaf and then I'm just gonna stir it all in just until the chocolate melts doing this off the heat cuz I don't want that milk to get too hot I think I need a whisk just get all the chocolate listed well it smells great now if it's not the vanilla and the coffee and milk chocolate OH Jeffers here I always have something special with me beside me yeah what do you got all right so you need a little hot chocolate wouldn't she say no that looks good huh that looks delicious like you're getting friends your favorite but I think I'm gonna whip it for how's this stand back I'm dangerous and they sit up front they want that it's an immersion blender been amazing I've never seen everything and it just makes it wonderful ready for a hot shot sure [Music] oh that's fantastic since I'm not making you dinner tonight was a sneak preview of breakfast tomorrow I can't wait it's early gotta make the brioche okay I've had a little coffee I'm ready to do it so I've got the brioche dough I took it out about a half an hour ago when I made my coffee can you believe how much that rose it's amazing so first thing is I'm gonna put a dough hook on the mixer this is what's called a dough hook and it's used for making breads I'm gonna put the dough right back in it's still really sticky get back in there okay got the dough in there now of course I'm gonna add butter it's part of the process of making brioche tablespoon at a time it's really important for it to be room temperature otherwise it'll never mix in so one and a half sticks it's 12 tablespoons let's get a little bit of flour so it comes back into a ball okay now I'm going to form it into a little brioche okay just dump it out on the board what I'm gonna do is my 20 little brioche so I'm just gonna Pat it out in a square this is a great little tool it's called a bench scraper it's a sort of professional tool you can either use this or a knife it's just fine so I'm going to cut it in quarters you cut each one of these sort of vaguely in fifths as much as possible just form a little ball you put it into the tin it's not so easy to eyeball these if you have a little scale it's great then one in 3/4 ounces each so soon as I'm done with this I'm gonna cover them with a cloth and let them rise until they're double in size and then I'm gonna bake them until they're golden brown and delicious and it gives me just enough time to go to the store to get the ingredients for my breakfast [Music] so Jeffrey thinks the morning just like any other morning a cup of coffee a few pieces of toast I'm gonna make him a really special breakfast I think you'll be surprised just need a few things at the grocery store [Music] that's my breakfast fruit crunch I need pineapple I love golden pineapples they're really sweeter than regular ones there are all kinds of tests for how to tell whether pineapple is right people pull the leaves out there's really only one test that works for me smell it it smells like a pineapple that's right I need some fresh strawberries and you can smell them to fit right don't stick your nose in it though and blueberries that's what they tell you what does these are ripe it's a taste one but I don't think they'd be very happy with me if I did so I think I'll trust they're good I was thinking of making blood orange mimosas so these peaches smells so wonderful I think I'll make blinis instead it's a peach puree with Italian sparkling wine called Prosecco it's really good and the way you tell whether peaches are ripe is don't press it'll only make a mark all you want to do is smell it and if it smells like a great peach it is and these are [Music] I better hurry up otherwise it's gonna be lunch not breakfast [Music] so I'm gonna make some dry old toasts maybe some leftover coffee for breakfast I got you the newspaper little live fire he's a fuckin the fire department around your breakfast okay that sounds good first I'm gonna make it vanilla so I can take a cup of oatmeal half a cup of coconut half a cup of almonds any kind of sliced blanched almonds there's nothing better than a really nice cold wine I'm just going to do three tablespoons of oil and take every spoons of honey it's good to put the oil and first cuz that honey instead of the tablespoon easy [Music] okay onto a baking sheet [Music] spread out with your hands in one layer into the oven 350 degrees until it's nice and golden brown and potential here we go a ritual as old as man himself that one has some fresh fruit mmm exactly what pineapple should smell like next two strawberries five strawberries should do it and I'll just do barest [Music] and I can smell the corn all I think mmm it's browned and golden and gorgeous and I can smell the coconut and almonds that's gonna be really delicious [Music] the moment of brioche truth they're great I'm always surprised so the only thing I want to do is do a little bit of an egg wash for the top so they get nice and golden brown on the top I have about a tablespoon of water in the dish and one egg it's gonna whisk them together I can actually already smell the yeast in them you don't want to dribble down otherwise it would be hard for them to come out of those little pans just a quick brush on the top these guys are gonna bake at 350 for about 20 minutes and they're gonna make the whole house smell wonderful okay this one [Music] time to assemble the breakfast fruit crunch I torture it's gonna be like an ice cream sundae so first I'm gonna put on the bottom with fresh fruit so plain yogurt you can use flavored yogurt but I think plain yogurt is better for this cuz the fruits so sweet and then sprinkling of granola more fruit you look like an ice cream sundae isn't thinking these a little sprinkling it for no at the top little crunch yes I flute look pretty good breakfast is almost ready all I have to do is make the peach Bellini so Jeffrey still on the study I'm sure he suspects nothing I've been banging pots together all morning well we'll see so the next thing I'm gonna make is a fresh peach Bellini Jeffrey took me to Venice wants and they're very famous for their Bellinis it's fresh peach juice mixed with Prosecco which is like champagne I'll show you how easy it is to make so I've got two peaches in here this ends everything I just took the seeds out and I'm just gonna puree it the riper the peaches are the better I'm gonna add a tablespoon of lemon juice 1 tablespoon of sugar and then just puree it again make sure this fall gets pureed boy that looks great I love the color of it so I'm gonna give it and that'll take any of the bits of the skin out I actually pureed it with the skin on both for the color and also the flavor but it's also easy hate peeling peaches I'm just gonna push it through the sieve and then the juice that comes out of this I'm gonna put it in a glass whoa what guys [Music] why [Music] toast and coffee for breakfast I don't think so breakfast is delicious hey this is a Bellini to start with peach juice and champagne Wow the blinis are from Venice my breakfast fruit crunch I saw in Belgium and from France I made fresh brioche and for America your own strawberry jam Oh Geoffrey strawberry I like having ice cream sundae for breakfast well I'll tell you what this is the best ice cream sundae I got entertainment I'm good for you unusual that is you made the jam jam yeah you make the place yeah cheers for international breakfast [Music]
I'm making golden roasted Cornish hands so the first thing I'm going to do is my cornbread stuffing for the Cornish em now they have to stick of unsalted butter it's four tablespoons and one cup of chopped onion about half of a large yellow onion I'm just going to cook it for a few minutes until the onions are translucent the next thing I need is one stalk of celery I'm going to dice it and add the celery to the onions and butter so they cook just a little bit visibly 1/2 a cup of chicken stock cornbread stuffing is really classic Thanksgiving thing I like really simple ones but you can always add sausage or chestnuts whatever you like the hard part here is scaling it down so that I can make enough for two Corner shams so I'm just guessing I need about two and a half cups of corn bread crumbs okay so the corn breads all crumbled up then add the celery and onions chicken stock right to the bowl okay a little parsley would be good and maybe a little salt and pepper to taste stir it up make sure the cornbread absorbs all the butter and onions and parsley all the flavor okay time to stuff these guys so these are two Cornish hens and I put them on a bed of onion so the onions cook with the Cornish and and fill each one Cornish hens are really like little chickens so they cook the same way but in less time these guys take about 35 to 40 minutes to cook its had their little legs together the whole point of time with things together is to make sure everything is very tight and it cooks evenly and then just tuck the little wings underneath so they stay tight okay and then order for them to Brown you want the outside to be very dry it's a little paper towel and you can put a little bit of butter or olive oil on the outside it really helps it Brown nicely and keeps it moist salt and pepper okay when to roast the 425 for about 35 to 40 minutes until they're brown on the outside and juicy and tender inside not the smell wonderful and nice set of onions I'm just going to test it see if it's done if you cut between the leg and the thigh and the juices run clear it's done and I'm going to cover a little as well for about 15 minutes it retains all the heat and the juices and the flavors right back into the cornerstone keeps it nice and warm for dinner gorgeous little Cornish hen a little bit of onion and you won't believe how delicious they are [Music]
[Music] the method I think I use the most it's particularly for salads it's bone-in skin-on chicken breast and I'm just going to show you how I do it olive oil salt and pepper it's as easy as that [Music] so olive oil salt and pepper lots of pepper you want to have lots of flavor in the oven 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and it comes out perfectly every time first step of the chicken but in the same oven let's cook some bacon and doing the same oven i roasted some nuts it's actually walnuts cashews and almonds they're just roasted them for like 10 minutes really brings out the flavor okay those are the components now we're going to make the vinaigrette so the first thing is olive oil I need two thirds of a cup of olive oil 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar next thing is mustard give it a little heat I love to add mustard to vinaigrette because it mul suffice it to teaspoons of honey just a little bit of sweetness is nice and then we're going to have teaspoons of salt one to have lots of flavor half teaspoon of pepper give it a whisk and that's a vinaigrette I just kind of with my hands just do large shreds of chicken the next thing is bacon it's nice and cool now and I'm just going to dice it up and next I've got all kinds of lettuces to put in I've got kale and frisée got them all washed and dried and you want to be sure to spin dry them really well because if they're wet the vinaigrette won't stick to it and the next thing is spinach and when these baby spinach leaves just wriggle in classic Waldorf salad has grapes I'm using red Lisa said that I have a cup okay next is cheese it's a really good sharp cheddar about a cup next the bacon and the chicken nice crisp red apple if you can make this a little in advance to the Apple s if you don't want to share too Brown okay now of course we need salt and pepper and the vinaigrette one last ingredient self balled eggs I'm just going to cut them in quarters and while I do I'm going to show you how I made them I put four extra-large egg into a medium saucepan and cover the most tap water brought it to a full boil then immediately turned off the heat I let them sit in the water for exactly four minutes then I put them into a bowl of cold tap water for two minutes to cool I like to put the eggs on top I don't want to mix them in too much because you don't want them messed up
Efrain needs an arsenal of really easy dinner party dishes just pour the sauce right over it oh my god this is delicious you wear so many different hats you're a cook caterer business owner author and the like if you had to give yourself a job title what would it what would it be cookbook writer I think that's my primary delight and everything else comes from that certainly not nuclear policy analyst you said that each of your books has a backstory each of your books has a point of view what's the point of view of your latest book well the book is called thinking ahead and the reason why I wrote it is because I get this question all the time I mean can I make Christmas cookies in July freeze them and defrost them in December and I thought no you really can't but there is a way to do it you can make the dough freeze it and then bake it off before you serve it that is absolutely the most frequent question can I make it ahead and I thought because I have so much experience in the food business as at a specialty food store I actually know how to make things ahead so I thought why don't I write that and see if I can solve people's problems you've had a really unconventional career trajectory you started your career in many ways in the window clear energy policies in the what is a likelihood of career move and your life changed very dramatically thanks to a New York Times ad describe what motivated you to take on this entrepreneurial endeavor well what happened was I found I was I mean I was working in the White House of nuclear energy policy thinking life has to be more fun than this and I saw an ad for business for sale in The New York Times and it was a specialty food store in a place I've never been before and what I used to do when I wasn't working as I would cook I would always cook on the weekends I cook at night I just love to cook and I really taught my taught myself how to cook and when I saw this ad for especially food store I thought oh maybe I could do this professionally instead of just in the in the time in-between so I went home I said to Jeffrey you know I really need to do something else and he gave me such great advice he said pick something fun if it's fun you'll be really good at it and I said funny you should mention it I saw this ad for a business for sale and he said let's go look at it you said that when you first started this story you didn't know what you were doing but you knew that it was what was what you wanted to do describe that process making that very dramatic career jump into this this very new experience was totally new for me in every way I'd never had employees I'd never been in the food business I didn't even been a waiter in a restaurant I didn't know how to prepare things professionally I really didn't know the deal I made the woman who sold me the store is that she would stay with me for a month and teach me what I needed to know of course thinking that a month would do it and I immediately I was in over my head and I went home and I said to Jeffrey I don't know if I'll ever be able to do this and he said to me if if you can do it in the first month you'll be bored in the second month and I thought that was such good that really focused me so he's been my best advisor you built this incredibly successful store catering business and the like but there was a point in time where you were eager to look at a next chapter in your life even if you may not have known what that chapter was how did you know when you were ready to move on and with very low threshold of boredom I just I eighteen years I just thought I really have to do something else and I think a lot of people find new stimulation in the business they're in and I really admire that I just I felt like I had you know made enough chocolate cakes and done enough parties and and in fact many years ago I was at a lunch and I was seated between Chuck Williams from William Sonoma and Joel Dean from Dean &amp; Deluca and I said to chuck when did you know that you'd hit the wall and he said 20 years I just couldn't do it I couldn't sweep the sidewalk one more time and I said the same thing to Joel Dean and said 20 years so I mean I think a lot of people keep their enthusiasm up past that but it seems to be the dividing line 20 years you did something a little bit unconventional and that you left the story sold the store and you didn't know what that never be I can honestly say I thought when I left the store that it was it was probably the end of my professional career and little did I know it hadn't even started it was a friend of mine who's actually therapist said type-a people think that they can do figure out what the what they're going to do next while they're doing something and they can't and I thought about it for a while maybe you're - I thought about what's next and I finally said okay I'm going to trust her and I'm going to try it and she was exactly right it was a really I mean I don't want to sort of sugarcoat this it was a really hard year because I've gone from like baking a thousand made gets and having all these customers and a lot going I'm really a lot going on to having literally nothing to do for a year you've scaled this extraordinary business extraordinary and growth but you've also been very decided about which opportunities you decide to pursue very you know very very conscious decisions in which areas you expand your business describe the process of how you evaluate new opportunities and what's been important to you as you've grown well I think one of the things that's different about me is I'm not twenty-five so I've done a lot of things and I love having a life I really love it and I don't want to do anything that changes that so I make decisions based on what's good for the brand you know what customers want like make it a head of something it's fair but it's something that I'm really interested in I make does it I have in my head sort of a list of words that the brand is about and I try and stick to that like the first word is fun I think as Oscar Wilde said it's work is easy fun is hard so if you're doing something that's fun I think people are just naturally attracted to that so I tend not to do something that's not fun which works for me personally also but I also I love being hands-on I don't love I couldn't imagine having like 20 restaurants and and a TV show and four cookbooks and I love doing things carefully and deliberately and I'm sure I could have a much bigger business if I was willing to do those things but I'm just not it just doesn't make me happy so I tend to keep it very tight and controlled and I think most people would be very surprised to find that my entire team is three of us and we meet every morning we have a great time together
years ago my husband and I were having a camping trip in the South of France and I remember seeing this lovely French family having a wonderful meal at a big long table overlooking the Mediterranean and so today I'm gonna try and recreate that well maybe without the Mediterranean well it's not a Mediterranean feast without grilled lamb my friend Miguel is outside doing this incredible table I'm sure it's gonna be gorgeous and totally over-the-top so I'm gonna keep it really simple in here I've asked the butcher to butterfly this lamb and what it is is they take about a whole leg of lamb with a bone in the middle and take the bone out and the whole key is to make the lamb one even thickness so when it gets on the grill it cooks at the same temperature so let's make the marinade I use an organic one but any kind of whole milk or if you want to be good even low-fat yogurt it's two pounds or two pints this one it is just good plain yogurt the first thing I'm gonna do is s this lemon what I use is a microplane which is wonderful it came from the hardware store but it's fabulous possessing lemons it's wonderful for Parmesan cheese the key to this is that you just get the lemon zest which is that bright yellow part and not the white part which is called the pith how's that for a weird word so I love the way this smells you can really smell the lemon so much in the zest I want to put in half a cup of olive oil and I always try and use extra virgin olive oil I'll whisk this in so two teaspoons of salt I like to use kosher so I think it's really softer and pepper and now for the key ingredient which is rosemary I love the way it smells it's really spicy but it can also very easily overwhelm whatever you're cooking pull the leaves right off the Rosemere I'm not going to chop them up because that really releases a lot of the oil from the rosemary and it'll see isn't it much too strongly but this will give a wonderful hint of rosemary in the meat and this just looks wonderful it's all the yogurt and the olive oil and fresh rosemary lemon zest salt and pepper and now the last thing I'm going to put the lamb in this is a really gooey messy part cook's best tools are clean hands and that's what I'm using so you take all the lamb and you put it right into this marinade and yesh mut sit around uh so oh it's good and messy oh it's just wonderful the reason why I'm marinating this is so that wonderful essence of rosemary and lemon get all the way into the meat of the lamb and the longer you marinated the better it'll taste and that's grilled it's gonna be so delicious oh this looks fabulous you like it I love it I think I know your great style but who knew you're an electrician the recipe is so nice and sort of dappled light under here exactly not it'll be gorgeous yeah because you're gonna get all this little color light you know reds and oranges and yellows it's gonna be nice cool okay I'm leaving it to this gorgeous setting and I'm off to the kitchen I'm looking forward to your food a terrific thing to serve with grilled lamb is tabbouleh it's this wonderful salad made from bulgur wheat and then I add all kinds of vegetables to it so this is my kind of cooking I've soaked this in boiling water that's all I had to do and then I added lemon juice salt pepper and a little bit of olive oil and that just the bulgur just absorbs all that wonderful flavor and now I'm just going to add in vegetables okay it got about a cup of scallions the next thing is these cucumbers I like these hothouse cucumbers or English cucumbers much better than traditional ones they're sweeter those traditional cucumbers the rhein can be really sort of bitter so I'm just going to take out the seeds and let's chop it up with the rind and all I love when the salad is really chunky and then you have the flavor of all the vegetables with a little bit of bulgur wheat in it rather than lots of bulgur wheat with just some seasonings okay the next thing is the cherry tomatoes and what I've done is cut them in half so that they're really easy to eat and it sweetens the dish it's they're really good in tabbouleh what I like to do is the classic ingredients but turn up the volume it's about two cups of tomatoes the next ingredient is parsley and this gives it so much flavor okay fabulous looks and I'm going to show you the easiest way to cut up parsley so all you have to do is just take your knife and run it along the edge forget pulling all those little leaves off those stems I need a better cup of chopped parsley and we're going to do this really rough chop so it still looks like parsley and just you can smell it the best way to do this is keep your knife right on the board at the tip and just go back and forth and that way you'll keep your hand out of it although I've got in my hand a few times okay add about a cup right on top of the tomatoes and then the last thing is mint got a big bunch of mint here and the same thing with a min I'm just going to slice the leaves off the stem and again a really rough chop oh god it smells so good mint is one of those things you want to buy because if you grow it in your garden before you know you'll let nothing but mint in your garden now comes the mixing part the more this two boys sits the more the flavors get really blended together salt and pepper and then we taste it and now comes the best part mmm it's almost right to think these a little bit of lemon so I'm gonna just squeeze some more lemon into it big squeeze of fresh lemon mmm and that was C perfect it's gonna be so good with the lamb only the hummus and roasted fruit left to go can't wait for the party and I went to the hummus it's a dip made with the chickpeas it requires no cooking at all and I have most of the ingredients in my pantry first thing I'm gonna do is chop the garlic and there's a terrific way in the food processor to chop them up really fine and through the feet to just drop them in and it minces them perfectly I put four garlic cloves in to start and I'm just gonna put everything else in the food processor the main thing is chickpeas which is the base of this I've drained about two cups which is about a can and none of these ingredients are exact you really want to do them so that they're to your taste just dump them right in and then the tahini TV is great it's a sesame seed paste usually comes the oil is a little collects on the top so I like to mix it up a little bit and it's sort of like peanut butter but it's made with sesame seeds and I'm gonna get a better third of a cup make a nice mess when I cook this recipe so simple because the ingredients all just go right in a lot of Houmas recipes can be really bland I like to just give an enormous flavor by adding lots of lemon juice and garlic and actually salt is an important ingredient so I'm going to put in maybe the juice of about two lemons and we'll save a little bit we can add it later we've got salt I'm gonna start with about one and a half teaspoons of salt and the last thing to just give it some heat is eight dashes of Tabasco it's so important to trust your own tastebuds I mean really just taste it see what you like just because I like it doesn't mean you're gonna like it so it's really important to to do that for yourself it's important to me that it has a lot of texture so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pulse it until it looks like it's smooth but still has the kind of texture I want I'd say it's a liquid from the chickpeas because I think it's a little too thick and I'm gonna add about two tablespoons of the liquid so we put it into a big bowl the good news about hummus is the earlier make of the better so just before I serve it I'm going to drizzle it with olive oil toss something Yoli nuts on it gonna be so good with pita bread no I think's going it looks great I love it yeah you know I always like to use white plates because then if I don't have enough of one set you can mix them all together but you do right okay fantastic you know we're gonna use this sort of known African glasses for wine right I do these are gorgeous rubbing you bring your West my party so these are the lemonade glasses yes Oh can't wait lots of lemonade untasted and lots of wine exact all right I'm off to do the grill otherwise we're not having dinner a friend brought me this really cool thing you can get in the hardware store mine's obviously been well used it's called a charcoal chimney and you put paper in the bottom charcoal on the top and you light the whole thing and it never needs charcoal lighter fluid so I'll show you how it works two pieces of paper right in the bottom turn it upside down charcoal on the top just go right up to the top and then just like newspaper the bottom why is it the window we supposed to smoke in your face it's guaranteed and now I'm off that's it roasted fruit is really my kind of cooking I'd love to take the intrinsic value of a particular ingredient and cook just to enhance it so that you get the deliciousness of the peaches that I'm going to roast and I'm going to put plums in you get the essence of the plums so I want to cut all these peaches up you can use really any kind of stone fruit for this peaches plums when they're in season apricots are fabulous I'm just gonna cut them all up and this one's delicious I can smell the peaches so I'm gonna cut up about five or six peaches here and put them in my dish I love to bake it in a dish I can serve it and so I don't even have to transfer it one of the great things about this dish is you can make it early in the day it can be served room-temperature it doesn't have to be hot out of the oven so I'm gonna put all the peaches just in one layer next go the plums you can really use any kind of soft fruit with it's mostly the things that have pits like plums peaches apricots but I think it's also delicious with papaya mango anything that will sort of when it cooks it'll get a little juicier I like to put the cut side up so that when it bakes and then when it boils later you'll see it gets nice and brown and caramelize on the top okay we're ready to go I'm gonna put about 1/2 a cup of sugar on the top but it's really your personal preference a lot depends on how sweet the fruit is if it's the height of summer and the peaches are really ripe you don't need quite so much sugar fruits so delicious now I'm not even gonna put all the sugar on and I've done it all in one layer so when the heat hits it it bakes evenly so I'm just gonna get the raspberries to finish you know one of the things about raspberries is don't wash them because they've already been washed they're just perfect the way they are and you don't want to get too much water into it and they've it just takes away some of that flavor okay into the oven 450 degrees a preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes until the fruit is just juicy and tender the lamb looks like it's been marinating long enough so it's got all those wonderful flavors the rosemary and the lemon zest and yogurt oh this is the squishy part try and brush up as much as I can because the marinade will catch on fire on the grill see paper towels I have to get it all off but I want to need the rosemary too to burn okay few utensils for the grill and we're ready to go ready to put this on the grill I love the flavor of charcoal it gives really simple food wonderful flavor in fact I'm usually out here in the middle of the winter with my hat and gloves on try to get something charcoal broiled so one of the things I do when I'm char calling is I brush the grill with oil and then it what it does is see it allows that meat to come off and not stick on the grill so that's all nicely oil so it won't stick just slide that right onto the grill love it sizzle so that 20 minutes and I'll be back to check don't you just love fresh lemonade and not that stuff your mother used to bring home from the grocery store but the real thing was made with freshly squeezed lemons it's just really tart and sweet and it's just so delicious one of the other things you can do is roll the lemon on the board and it really just releases a lot of the juice so when you slice it you get more juice out of it I'm gonna juice about 6 lemons it's a better cup of lemon juice that's perfect I just don't lemonade be great with a Mediterranean feast and for those of you I like a little something special you can mix it with vodka and now I need some sugar you know you might think this is crazy but when I go shopping I'd buy two of everything two pastas and two oatmeal's two coffees and that way I only have to shop half as many times so I've got my superfine sugar I think traditionally it's used for drinks like Manhattan's but it's great in lemonade if you don't have it don't worry about it just use regular sugar so that's about three quarters of a cup of sugar and now a cup of ice and four cups of water how easy is that this would be perfect but first we have to taste it oh it's fabulous a perfect balance of lemon and sugar and it's nice and chilled so it's all ready for the party I'm definitely putting back getting mine so let's take a look at this ah it's all bubbly and the peaches look gorgeous just gonna make sure they're perfectly done they're nice and tender now I'm gonna put it on broil for about five to eight minutes until it's nice and brown and caramelized and then I'm going to put some orange juice right on the top the orange juice is going to give a little sweetness but a little acidity so I think it should be done oh that's perfect doesn't look fabulous little orange juice on actually cools it off nicely and it's absorbed into the sauce that the raspberries make and now I have to taste just make sure it's the right balance of all the fruit and then it's sweet and tart at the same time mmm there's all those juices of peaches and raspberries a little bit of sugar it's just perfect let's see how this is doing perfectly grilled on one side flip it over oh that looks incredible really smell the lamb the rosemary and the charcoal well the outside looks fabulous but now comes the really hard part is it done is it not done it's really hard for me to tell and I'm sure it is for everybody this whole restaurant school of testing and does it spring back doesn't it I think unless you're on a restaurant grill all day long it's really hard to tell that way and I'm gonna cheat if the internal temperature is about 120 degrees if you know how to use a meat thermometer it'll help but I wanted to actually come off the grill when it's still a little too rare because it's going to sit and it's going to be covered and it'll continue to cook a little bit but if you cut a little slit right into the meat you can look inside Oh perfect it's gonna be really fun because everybody's gonna be able to put together their own penis sandwiches it's fun for my guess but the secret is I don't have to do it myself good Greek feta is perfect spicy creamy wonderful olives the party's gonna be great tonight all my good friends great food what could go wrong drizzle some olive oil of the hummus and then some toasted formulas on top that was delicious and while the lamps rusting I'm gonna get ready for the party so everybody's outside I slipped away to slice the lamb but I loved about this meal cuz everything's done before the guests arrive all I have to do is slice the meat and we're ready to rock and roll can smell the rosemary and the lemon I took it off a little before it was done it was a little too rare but it keeps cooking when it's sitting under the foil it's just perfect I'm so pleased and should be nice and tender because of the marinade one of the things I feel strongly about is the platter is garnished with the ingredients of whatever the dish is so I'm just gonna take a big chunk of lemon and put it on the platter big sprig of rosemary and that everybody knows it's rosemary lemon what I love about it is that everything's room temperature so it's not like hot it's not cold just is all out it's really easy it's great somebody have Julia tell what should I do if I don't want to use butter she said well you don't like butter just use cream
[Music] my friend Frank has invited some friends to dinner tonight and I'm testing soup recipes all day so I said what are we join forces I'll bring soup to your house for dinner that way he doesn't have to cook and I can rotate as my recipes the first soup is a really hearty lentil soup with spicy sausage and it's sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese the second recipe is a seafood stew that's full of shrimp and chunky fish just like a classic bluey bez but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] some of my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water they dose up for about 15 minutes just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make big pot of soup and put them in and cook so I was with most soups I start with onions I'm just a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions at four cups of leeks it makes a lot of soup I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because you can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months one tablespoon of chopped garlic we're just met three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves I'm just gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good to get it lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and one and a half teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just going to cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup well that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's going to be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is carrots keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually like it to look like it's homemade okay just big days more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just gonna boot cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery I'm going to do it right down the middle I'm Barefoot Contessa we have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery and you'd end up with like 200 quarts of soup it was really good okay so that's the carrots and the celery let me see if onions are ready no they're just simmering way here yeah they're perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender Lise okay now I'm going to add all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be really hard a soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s it was considered like hippie vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown lentils and have more flavor next is chicken stock how my chicken stuck you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken second it's so easy to make so I have three quarts you'll go right in somebody find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens in a pot with some carrots and celery thyme whole peppercorns it's so easy and I'm always in the kitchen for a couple of hours and it just boils away and then you have a really good stock to make soups with I just keep it in the freezer and it's ready whenever I want to make soup okay so that's three quarts of chicken stock and then a quart of a cup of tomato paste gives it a lot of flavor it's surprising and last but not least lentils so this is a pound of lentils that I've soaked for about 15 minutes just pour them all in this is a big pot of soup so we're just going to simmer this for about an hour all the flavors are going to blend together and then it Franks has someone add spicy kielbasa sausage and I'm going to serve it with a drizzle of olive oil red wine and some Parmesan cheese delicious [Music] hmmm chive biscuits I thought they'd be wonderful with my soups thinking biscuits really is a lot like making scones the same sort of process so first I need 2 cups of flour into my mixer the key to both of them is the butter you want it really cold and you want it in big chunks so they stay nice and light and fluffy one tablespoon of baking powder one teaspoon of soft [Music] and once you spill of sugar just a little bit of sweetness in them okay the next thing is butter so once take a very cold butter and we're going to dice it and then put it in the mixer and the mixers can do all the work [Music] okay I'm just going to mix it until the butters about the size of peas okay meantime I need 3/4 of a cup of half-and-half can really make scones with any kind of savory herb like time would be wonderful for Sage maybe for Thanksgiving making with Said's I'd be good with turkey until that's ready on one chop some chives just line them up nice sharp knife hmm smells great it's a really delicate onion flavor it's gonna be good in the biscuits okay got a half a cup who's gonna put it in at the end so it doesn't get all smashed up a really fresh chive flavor okay that looks good I can pour the cream in slowly with a mixer on it's a really wet dough but it's really delicious and the chives okay they're ready to roll out okay flour the board that's a really nice dough I can really smell the chives too it's great good that's sticky this should make better 8-bit biscuits just keep moving around on the board you just want to make sure it doesn't stick and you can pat them out or you can roll the map I was like to roll it looks nice smooth even biscuit I just think it's nice if you have something as simple as soup to have something a little special like homemade bread okay two and a half inch cutter just come out put them on the pan these are great served on their own but they're also absolutely delicious sort of as a little sandwich like a 40 or something I bet than that thing that's great exactly eight okay now I'm going to do a little egg wash make the tops nice and brown and a little bit of half-and-half just whisk it together that easy to do in a small ball okay I'm just gonna brush the top slightly well these are gonna be just delicious with soups okay - like the smell of biscuits 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and when a delicious jive biscuits with our soup [Music] I love a classic French boy abyss but it takes forever to make so instead I'm going to make a seafood stew with all the same flavors shellfish shrimp fish and it's going to be so delicious hi Neil hi how are you I'm good incredible display so I'm making a seafood stew okay can you get me a few things actually there are a lot of kinds of shrimp but why don't I take the clean ones all right so a pound of clean shrimp please and then I can always peel them in devayne them myself but why not get them already done that's a lot of work they - sometime exactly [Music] 24 mussels all right she's a great they are wonderful and I need a pound of halibut delay sure fabulous you and I need a plan to see bass please all right you know there are a few things to look for when you're looking for fish and I think the pretty standard one is that it doesn't smell very fishy and this I mean there's no fish smell here it's amazing and the other is that the eye of the fish is really bright that was really fast thanks so much Neal well it's gonna be great they do thank you enjoy bye-bye [Music] second soup I want to test is seafood stew so the first thing I heat some oil and then cut up some onions two yellow onions oil is hot it's going to put the onions right in next I'm going to do potatoes I need 2 cups of potatoes and these are you kind of go they have lots of flavor next the fennel I love bell it's got that wonderful anise flavor and when it's cooked not that crazy about it raw but when it's cooked it just there's a really delicate flavor so I'm just gonna chop this up this were very porous all flavor and into the soup okay that's it for the fennel two teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of pepper stir it all together let's gonna cook about 15 minutes so the vegetables and the potatoes are all tender in the meantime I need some seafood for the seafood stew [Music] lots of great seafood it's a good stock so first thing I want to do is soak the mussels sometimes have a little sand and the mussels and nobody needs sand in their seafood stew so put them in a bowl fill those water and then a handful of flower in the water just mix it around and what happens is the muscles break the water with the flower and they discourage any of sand that they have inside to leave these to soak and I think seafood stew is ready for a little wine two clips of a nice dry white wine you never cook with anything I wouldn't want to drink and seafood stock you can make it organ by it I need four cups which is a quart it smells good and one twenty ounce can of tomatoes warm right in okay next we want to add some garlic got to have garlic and seafood stew sounds going to chop it out three cloves 3 big cloves of garlic actually add this later in the stew so it doesn't burn okay three cloves of garlic right into the stew and then the truly Provencal ingredient is saffron it's the stamens of crocuses you want to choose really good whole saffron not the powdered Cong and I'm going to add one teaspoon which is all of this they love saffron it really gives a full flavor and a little bit of spice to this do so this is going to just simmer for about 15 minutes while I get the seafood ready so I owe this great fish first want to start with a halibut just slice it in big chunks do is want to choose sort of firm flesh fish it's not going to just disintegrate in this do the second one it's a sea bass [Music] who's going slices across to so you want big enough chunks so then it's just integrate but small enough ones I still actually cooking let's do pretty quickly okay next one we'll rinse the mussels first I'm just going to check and see if any of them are open permanently Simmons they're not alive and they all look gorgeous so they're fun it's gonna risk me a few times to make sure there's no flour perfect ok the last things the shrimp before my glad I got this peeled and deveined so much work okay I think the students just about ready for the seafood well this looks pretty good okay lots of fish stir it in it's going to cook really fast now mix the shrimp [Music] this looks so chunky and delicious full of flavors okay last the muscles I love the color and the texture the snake let alone the flavor it's gonna cook in about five minutes all the fish and the shrimp and mussels are gonna be done and then when I go to Frank's house I'm gonna add the two essential for your best ingredients Curnow and orange zest squeeze so delicious [Music] Frank's guests are arriving he's giving you the nice glass of white wine and I'm gonna just finish the soups love cooking in this kitchen so the seafood student needs a little bit of orange zest and some pear no I love this two flavors in it okay that should be about a tablespoon put the orange zest into the soup splash of Pernod liquors flavor that really brings out the flavor of this film just going to mix it together this looks so gorgeous [Music] well that's ready they better be hungry as a friend they better not be having too much fun without me I'm going to feel like Cinderella in the kitchen now okay one soup down one to go so I made lentil soup often but I just thought I'd experiment by putting sausage in it so I'm putting in kielbasa which is a cooked Polish sausage it's really good it's got some nice spice to it but this is really easy because you don't even have to cook it it's already smoked and cooked okay let's see how the lentil soup is doing oh looks pretty good just show this guy ad wonderful so I'm just gonna put the sausage in all I have to do is just heat it through which will happen pretty fast it's a really hearty soup and the I think adding the Cabasa really makes it like a meal both of these soups can meal in themselves Cary's which one people are going to like more so little splash of red wine or red wine vinegar and then I'm going to serve it with a drizzle of olive oil and some grated Parmesan cheese it's gonna be really good so how's it going in here this smells good reading so hungry just knowing it's sausage a lentil it's legible and sausage and this is the stove that I wanted what this thing

is seafood stew sausage yeah the sausage jokes what at rizal about that's really good I'll try anything anything lots of parmesan what would like a chive biscuit help yourself yes I'm testing recipe so I hope you like them this is plenty nicely on your hands right this big dice more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just going to boot cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery I'm going to do it right down at Barefoot Contessa we used to have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery and you'd end up with like 200 quarts of soup but it was really good okay so that's the carrots and the celery let me see if I already know they're just simmering away here yeah they're perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender please okay now I'm gonna add all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be really hard a soup okay just saute those for a minute soand drain the lentils and I think Lendl's got but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] so of my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water in a step for my 15 minutes it just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make big pot of soup and put them in and cook so was with most soups I start with onions I'm just a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions that's four cups of leeks it makes a lot of soup I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because you can freeze it so easily and then you have super months one tablespoon of chopped garlic we're just about three cloves of garlic [Music] who's gonna slice this across to so you want big enough chunks so then it's just integrate but small enough ones I still actually cook them let's do pretty quickly okay next time we'll rinse the mussels first I'm just going to check and see if any of them are open permanently Simmons are not alive and they all look gorgeous so they're fine it's gonna risk me a few times to make sure there's no flour perfect okay the last things the shrimp what my glad I got this peeled and deveined so much work okay I think the students just about ready for the seafood this looks pretty good okay lots of fish stir it in it's going to cook really fast now mix the shrimp [Music] this looks so chunky and delicious full of flavors okay and last the mussels I love the color and the texture the snake let alone the flavor it's going to cook in about five minutes all the fish and the shrimp and mussels are going to be done and then when I go to Frank's house I'm going to add the two essential Queen Bess ingredients here no and orange zest squeeze so delicious [Music] Frank's guests are arriving he's giving you the nice glass of white water and I'm gonna just finish the soups love cooking in this kitchen so the seafood student needs a little bit of orange zest and some pear no I love those two flavors in the okay that should be about a tablespoon but the orange zest into the soup splash of Pernod liquors flavor that really brings out the flavor of this phenol just we mix it together [Music] this looks so gorgeous [Music] well that's ready they better be hungry they better not be having too much fun without me I'm going to feel like Cinderella in the kitchen now okay one soup down one to go so I made lentil soup often but I just thought I'd experiment by putting sausage in it so I'm putting in kielbasa which is a cooked Polish sausage it's really good got some nice spice to it but this is really easy because you don't even have to cook it it's already smoked and cooked and okay let's see how lentil soup is doing oh looks pretty good just throw this guy on [Music] wonderful so I'm just gonna put the sausage in all I have to do is just heat it through which will happen pretty fast it's a really hearty soup and I think that adding the cabassa really makes it like a meal both of these soups can meal in themselves curious which one people are gonna like more so a little splash of red wine or red wine vinegar and then I'm going to serve it with a drizzle of olive oil and some grated Parmesan cheese it's gonna be really good so how's it going in here sounds good we're getting so hungry just nowhere well it's sausage a lentil it's lentil and sausage shot good and this is the stove that I wanted what this thing would could you come and do this every night everybody's ready for dinner yeah so this is seafood stew [Music] lentil soup sausage yeah this awesome chick screaming what a drizzle about it's really good I'll try anything anything lots of parmesan who would like a child Fiske and help yourself yes I'm testing recipe so I hope you like them this is plenty nicely on your parents okay so do you like volatile some kind of a seafood stew logos salsa with that I like the sauce okay that's my Road chest thank you for being anywhere that's a really nice dough you really smell the chives - it's great good and sticky this should make better 8-bit biscuits just keep moving around on the board you just want to make sure it doesn't stick I love a classic French boy abyss but it takes forever to make so instead I'm going to make a seafood stew with all the same flavors shellfish shrimp fish and it's going to be so delicious hi Neil hi how are you I'm good incredible display Wow so I'm making a seafood stew can you get me a few things actually a lot of kinds of shrimp but why don't I take the clean ones all right so a pound of clean shrimp please and then I can always peel them into vein them myself but why not get them already done it's a lot of work stay tuned sometime exactly [Music] 24 muscles all right it's a break you're wonderful and I need a pound of halibut delay sure fabulous and I need a plan to seabass please all right you know there are a few things to look for when you're looking for fish and I think they're pretty standard one is that it doesn't smell very fishy and this I mean there's no fish smell here it's amazing and the other is that the eye of the fish is really bright that was really fast thanks so much Neal well it's gonna be great here they do thank you enjoy bye bye [Music] second soup I want to test is seafood stew so the first thing I heat some oil and then cut up some onions two yellow onions oil is hot it's going to put the onions right in next I'm going to do potatoes I need 2 cups of potatoes and these are you kind go they have lots of flavor next the fennel I love bell it's got that wonderful anise flavor and when it's cooked not that crazy bet it raw but when it's cooked it just is a really delicate flavor so I'm just gonna chop this up this we're very poor lasalle flavor and into the city okay that's it for the fennel two teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of pepper you stir it all together that's going to cook about 15 minutes so the vegetables and the potatoes are all tender in the meantime I need some seafood for the seafood stew [Music] lots of great seafood seafood stock so first thing I want to do is soak the mussels sometimes a little sand and the mussels and nobody needs sand in their seafood stew so them in a bowl fill it with water and then a handful flour in the water just mix it around and what happens is the mussels break the water with the flour and they discourage any of sand that they have inside to leave these to soak and I think seafood stew is ready for a little wine two clips of a nice dry white wine you never cook with anything I wouldn't want to drink and seafood stock you can make it organ by it I need four cups which is a quart it smells good and one twenty ounce can of plum tomatoes form right in okay next I'm going to add some garlic gotta have garlic and seafood stew sounds going to chop it up three cloves 3 big cloves of garlic actually add this later in the stew so it doesn't burn okay three cloves of garlic right into the stew and then the truly Provencal ingredient is saffron it's the stamens of crocuses you want to choose really good whole saffron not the powdered con and I'm going to add one teaspoon which is all of this I love saffron it really gives a full flavor and a little bit of spice to this do so this is kind of just simmer for about 15 minutes while I get the seafood ready so all this great fish first we're gonna start with a halibut just blast it in big chunks you always want to choose sort of firm flesh fish it's not gonna just disintegrate in this do ii wanted to see that i'm whole peppercorns it's so easy and I'm always in the kitchen for a couple of hours and it just boils away and then you have a really good stock to make soups with I just keep it in the freezer and it's ready whenever I want to make soup okay so that's three quarts of chicken stock and then a quarter of a cup of tomato paste gives it a lot of flavor it's surprising and last but not least lentils so this is a pound of lentils that I've soaked for about 15 minutes just pour them all in this is a big pot of soup so we're just going to simmer this for about an hour all the flavors are going to blend together and then it Franks has someone add spicy cabassa sausage and I'm going to serve it with a drizzle of olive oil red wine and some Parmesan cheese delicious [Music] hmmm chive biscuits I thought they'd be wonderful with my soups making biscuits really is a lot like making scones the same sort of process so first I need 2 cups of flour into my mixer the key to both of them is the butter you want it really cold and you want it in big chunks so that they stay nice and light and fluffy one tablespoon of baking powder one teaspoon of salt [Music] and once he's put a sugar just a little bit of sweetness in them okay the next thing is butter so once take a very cold butter and we're going to dice it and then put it in the mixer and the mixers can do all the work [Music] okay I'm just going to mix it until the butter is about the size of peas okay meantime I need 3/4 of a cup of half-and-half can really make scones with any kind of savory herb like time would be wonderful or sage maybe for Thanksgiving make them look Said's I'd be good with Turkey until that's pretty much up some chives let's line them up nice sharp knife hmm smells great it's a really delicate onion flavor it's gonna be good in the distance okay kind of half a cup we're gonna put it in at the end so it doesn't get all smashed up a really fresh chive flavor okay that looks good I can pour the cream in slowly with a mixer on it's a really wet dough but it's really delicious and the chives okay they're ready to roll out okay flour the board this is a really nice do you really smell the chives - it's great good and sticky this should make that 8-foot biscuits just keep moving around on the board you just want to make sure it doesn't stick and you can pat them out or you can roll the mat I was like to roll it that's nice smooth even biscuit I just think it's nice if you have something as simple as soup to have something a little special like homemade bread okay two and a half inch cutter just come out let them up and these are great served on their own but they're also absolutely delicious sort of as a little sandwich like a 40 or something how bad can that be that's great exactly eight okay now I'm going to do a little egg wash make the tops nice and brown and a little bit of half-and-half just whisk it together that easy to do with a small ball I'm just gonna brush the top slightly well these are gonna be just delicious with soups okay I feel like the smell of biscuits 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and when a delicious chive biscuits with our soup you [Music] my friend Frank has invited some friends to dinner tonight and I'm testing soup recipes all day so I said why don't we join forces I'll bring soup to your house for dinner that way he doesn't have to cook and I can road test my recipes the first soup is a really hearty lentil soup with spicy sausage and it's sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese the second recipe is a seafood stew that's full of shrimp and chunky fish just like a classic bluey bez but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] two of my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water they dose up for my 15 minutes just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make big pot of soup and put them in and cook so I was with most soups I start with onions I'm just a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions that's four cups of leeks it makes the latter suit I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because it can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months one tablespoon of chopped garlic we're just about three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves I'm just gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good to get it lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just going to cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup well that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's gonna be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is Karis keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually liked it to look like it's homemade okay just big dice more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just going to cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery I'm just going to do it right down the middle at Barefoot Contessa we have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery and you'd end up with like 200 quarts of soup but it's really good okay so that's the carrots in the celery let me see if bones are ready no they're just simmering away here yeah they're perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender leaves okay now I'm gonna end all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be a really hearty soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s it was considered like hippy vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown lentils and they have more flavor next is chicken stock I'll make chicken stock you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken second it's so easy to make so I have three quarts which is gonna go right in somehow I find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens and a pot with some carrots and celery
[Music] when I bought their freaking Tesla in 1978 I had no idea how much chicken salad I'd be making but this is the one that Diana taught me with grapes and walnut chicken salad contesta but kind of like chicken salad with a Waldorf salad and the first thing I'm going to do with it because half a cup of pecans half a cup of walnuts just to crisp them up a little bit 350 degrees for about 70 minutes and this just tastes better that way i reversed of the chicken and let it cool a little bit I'm just going to take the skin off i roast it on the bone with a skin on it keeps it really moist so just take this skin off and then cut it right off the bone just cut right around a sharp knife the chicken salad recipes at the store we started with something like 200 pounds of chicken so it's always funny for me to be making chickens out from two chicken breasts but it's just good okay now for the dressing I need to have a cup of mayonnaise half a cup of sour cream it's a very creamy dressing but it's great balance two teaspoons of salt half a teaspoon of pepper whisk it up now I'm going to add tarragon it's a really mild flavored herb just big rough chop okay now most of its going to go in the sauce I'm gonna save a little bit of garnish whisk it up add the chicken big spoon just toss it together chickens really moist the sauce is great okay the person that should be done perfectly comes from the Choson right in so if they have a cup of pecans and 1/2 cup of walnuts and now I need grapes but a cup of grapes cut them right in half just toss them in chickens all it's great for entertaining because you can make an advance to serve it at room temperature okay just toss that all together that's pretty good doesn't like just use a nice butter lettuce it's really delicate just really sets it off I've had big scoop of chicken salad
[Music] my friend Miguel Flores biana and I have worked together for years he's been a respected magazine editor and now he's decided to become a photographer and he's very good he's coming today to photograph my garden I think I'll make him lunch and maybe something beautiful to photograph I'll make him an easy and colorful lemon fusilli with arugula followed by his favorite poem cake que tan and for photographing maybe some roasted tomatoes with fresh basil from my garden and for dinner tonight I think I'll make myself a salad with basil green goddess dressing with Miguel behind the lens I better be sure that these recipes are ready for their close-ups [Music] my plum cake Titanic is a twist on a classic French dish called tarte tatin which is made with apples but I'm gonna make it with plums instead so I'm gonna make a little bit of caramel with a cup of sugar and 1/3 of a cup of water it's gonna cook it over medium heat until it's nice and caramelized and brown wonderful and I'm gonna start cutting up the plum so I'm gonna cut these farms in half just take out the little pits which is sometimes not that easy to do these pumps are available sort of late summer early autumn and they're just wonderful they're called Italian prune plums if you want to make this cake another time you can make it with peaches or apples so delicious and it's really easy so I'm going to start with a 9 inch pie plate that I've greased and about 10 to 12 plums depending on the size of the plums let's see if these will make it around and I'm going to take the plums and put them cut side down at a decorative fashion because this is gonna turn upside down you want them to be really pretty we put as many as you can in the chocolate okay last pump might say that was perfect um the caramels already it's nice and warm to a very warm chestnut kind of color just swirl be sure you never stirred I'm just gonna pour it right over the plums and it's gonna make a wonderful caramel crust that's gorgeous why is Miguel out in the garden photographing he should be in you're photographing this so for the cake part of my plum cake take town first thing in these six tablespoons of butter it's 3/4 of a stick 3/4 of a cup of sugar it's a pretty easy cake but it's got a little lemon zest in it so it's got great flavor I'm just gonna cream that together until it's light and fluffy Saiki mosted in the bowl I need two extra-large eggs let's turn the mix it down to low and put in the eggs one at a time just until they're really incorporated don't worry about over beating it now [Music] I'm just gonna scrape down the sides make sure it's well incorporated okay well that's Mexican really great some lemon zest that I have a teaspoon of lemon zest just that's really nice flavor to the cake batter and I think really complements the plums okay half a teaspoon of lemon zest and a half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract mmm love that started a cup of sour cream [Music] okay that's the sour cream those are the wet ingredients now I'm gonna do the dry ingredients I need a cup and 2 tablespoons of flour don't ask why 2 tablespoons it just works and actually when I measure flour I fluff it first with a cup or the spoon and then just level it off just to ensure the same measurement each time I need 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt kosher salt just sift them all together perfect what makes for online just put all the dry ingredients in mmm it's good it's not the lemon zest [Music] just makes it just until it's mixed actually I tend to stop it even before it's just mixed and finish it with a spatula this is actually the time to not over beat the batter because it'll develop the gluten in the flour and you'll end up with bread dough instead of cake not good so I just make sure it's really mixed with a spatula I'm just going to pour this right over these plums what's amazing is the caramel is hardened completely but when it bakes the juices from the plums and the caramel will just get very soft and they'll get right into the cake and it's just delicious so spread this out mmm I'm gonna bake this 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes so I think next I'm gonna do some tomatoes with basil for Miguel to photograph I have some tomatoes and there's great basil in the garden it'd be nice from def something beside Gardens to photograph so into the oven this could be really good dessert [Music] I'm Miguel how's it going hey it's going well I take some basil I need yeah I'm gonna take some pictures oh come on ready come on I love this much much more tuna today yeah take pictures of the garden anyways with my tomatoes once more I'm out of here [Music] some girls asked me to do food that's pretty enough to photograph and of course I want to do food that's good enough to eat so I'm gonna do both I thought would be nice to make roasted tomatoes with basil I mean how colorful is that so what I'm gonna do is I take plum tomatoes and the interesting thing about plum tomatoes is they really available year-round but they really don't have a lot of flavor so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna roast them and it really concentrates the flavor so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the seeds and the core out because they don't have as much flavor I really just want to have the shell collect the flavorings that I'm gonna put into it anytime you want concentrated flavor of something just roasted [Music] okay first flavoring is garlic just means two cloves of garlic chop it up really fine girl looks actually amazing cuz when it's raw it's really sort of pungent and not pleasant to eat but when it cooks if it's not too high temperature it just has a wonderful sweet flavor okay I'm supposed to break this over the tomatoes try and get it into the shells a quarter of a cup of olive oil just gonna drizzle it over don't want to have tablespoons of good balsamic vinegar just enough so you get a little bit in each one two teaspoons of sugar that really helps the caramelization may be suppressed it doesn't make it sweet at all one nifty spoons of salt [Music] and heaven teaspoon of pepper okay into the oven 450 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna just finish it with lots of basil and they'll be ready for their close-up I think the plum cake 210 is just ready well it looks pretty good uh looks great as tempting as it is to turn it out now it has to sit for 15 minutes otherwise the caramel just all run off the last thing I want to do for these tomatoes that Miguel is gonna photograph I'm gonna do just a shower of fresh basil on it I'm just gonna take the leaves roll them up this is called julienne or ship nod just roll them up like a little cigar and then just slice them mmm so function it's wonderful okay right on top of the tomatoes a little bit of flake salt always looks gorgeous in a photograph hi Miguel I've got tomatoes for you to photograph oh good what do you think that's the moment I was waiting for okay I'm gonna leave them to nude photographs I'm gonna go finish lunch I'll join you in a minute okay [Music] well it's time for the moment of truth to see if I can actually take this plum cake to town out of the pan it's kind of like when you open the oven door and you don't know whether the souffle is risen but we shall see it's been sitting for about 10 or 15 minutes it's still really warm and hopefully the Carol will be exactly right okay the big moment straight over beautiful it looks sometimes it creates a little bit of a vacuum so you just have to run your knife right underneath it now that I've flunked a tattoo isn't that gorgeous I'm gonna dust it a little bit of confectioner sugar it'll be just gorgeous I think the girl's gonna love this hey desserts ready [Music] lemon fizzy lose a classic Barefoot Contessa recipe whenever we're running out of dinners in the store I knew I can make huge quantities of it really fast so it's fusilli broccoli and I'm gonna make a lemon cream sauce pour it into the pot boiling salted water just for all the broccoli and it's gonna cook it for about three minutes until it's crisp tender then I'm gonna shock at nice water to stop the cooking and then later it's gonna heat up right in the pasta the pasta and a fizzy Lea little oil in the water just so it doesn't stick salt okay just stir it around make sure

they're just gonna become incredibly flavorful sauce okay that's the zest of two lemons right into the cream and then the juice of two lemons two teaspoons of salt remember this is the sauce on the pasta so it has to be really strongly flavored one teaspoon of pepper it's gonna stir that around so this is just gonna simmer about 10 to 12 minutes until it's reduced by half and by then the pasta should be done [Music] okay sauce looks like it's ready so you just starts to coat the spoon just like a white sauce smells cool delicious lemon and garlic in the port right over the pasta and the

chopped scallions it's like six or seven scallions it's gonna rough chop them because it's all gonna get pureed in the food processor okay and a cup of mayonnaise in quarter of a cup of lemon juice

been sitting for about 10 or 15 minutes it's still really warm and hopefully the Carol will be exactly right okay the big moment beautiful looks sometimes it creates a little bit of a vacuum so you

cup of sour cream [Music] okay that's the sour cream those are the wet ingredients now I'm gonna do the dry ingredients I need a cup and 2 tablespoons of flour don't ask why 2 tablespoons it just works and actually when I measure flour fluff it first with a cup of the spoon and then just level it off just to ensure the same measurement each time I need 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter of a teaspoon of smells feel delicious lemon and garlic in the port right over the pasta and the broccoli ok this Parmesan cheese not as much as you like better quarter half a cup something like that yeah ok lots of cherry tomatoes this gorgeous toss it all together so the sauce is the parmesan get up into everything mmm that looks great had two more things just a few pieces of lemon tossed into it it really just looks so much better and the last thing is fresh arugula I have some baby arugula this is gorgeous it's a big handful ever rugal it goes into it just toss it together and the heap and the pastas just gonna wilt the arugula just enough there for it clatter lots of cherry tomatoes now I would say sprinkling of parmesan few pieces of women and lunch is served [Music] Miguel lunch is ready mmm how's the photographs come here great but that's even better that's just lunch well you have no no no you can't photograph come on come sit what is what is that it's a lemon pasta with arugula broccoli and how's that right with an orange napkin perfect what is it cream mother little frames okay time for dessert what a little piece how about big that's for you thank you help you like it [Music] too bad about my diet yeah we go you're really good audience I get it ready well that was my idea of a great day Miguel's on his way home I've all this basil left over and I hate to waste basil I know I have a lot I usually make pesto but I thought I'm gonna be nice have some basil green goddess dressing so that's what I'm gonna make so the first thing I need is a cup of basil so I'm just gonna throw it right a measurement each time I need half a teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt kosher salt just sift them all together perfect what the mixer on low just put all the dry ingredients in mmm it's good it smell the lemon zest [Music] just mix it just until it's mixed actually I tend to stop it even before it's just mixed and finish it with a spatula this is actually the time to not over beat the batter because it'll develop the gluten in the flour and you'll end up with bread dough instead of cake not good so I just make sure it's really mixed with a spatula I'm just gonna pour this right over these plums what's amazing is the caramel is hardened completely but when it bakes the juices from the plums and the caramel will just get very soft and they'll get right into the cake and it's just delicious so spread this out mmm I'm gonna bake this 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes so I think next I'm gonna do some tomatoes with basil for Miguel to photograph I have some Tomatoes and there's great basil in the garden it'd be nice for him deaf something beside Gardens to photograph step into the oven it's going to be really good dessert [Music] I'm Miguel how's it going hey it's going well I take some basil I need yeah and I think some pictures oh come on already come on I love us more much more interesting in the day yeah Christmas is the garden little basil for my tomatoes one less one I'm out of here and you girls asked me to do food that's pretty enough to photograph and of course I want to do food that's good enough to eat so I'm gonna do both I thought would be nice to make roasted tomatoes with basil I mean how colorful is that so what I'm going to do is I take plum tomatoes and the interesting thing about plum tomatoes is they're really available year-round but they really don't have a lot of flavor so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna roast them and it really concentrates the flavor it's we're going to do is I'm gonna take the seeds and the core out because they don't have as much flavor I really just want to have the shell collect the flavoring said I'm gonna put into it anytime you want concentrated flavor of something just roasted [Music] okay first flavoring is garlic just means took those the garlic chopped it up really fine girl looks actually amazing cuz when it's raw it's really sort of pungent and not pleasant to eat but when it cooks if it's not to high temperature it just has a wonderful sweet flavor okay I'm supposed to print this over the tomatoes and get it into the shells quarter of a cup of olive oil just gonna drizzle it over don't wanted to have tablespoons of good bus on my vinegar just enough so you get a little bit in each one two teaspoons of sugar that really helps the caramelization may be suppressed it doesn't make it sweet at all 1/2 teaspoons of salt [Music] and half a teaspoon of pepper okay into the oven 450 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna just finish it with lots of basil and they'll be ready for their close-up take the plum-cake to town just ready well it looks pretty good uh looks great as tempting as it is to turn it out now it has to sit for 15 minutes otherwise the caramel just all run off the last thing I want to do for these tomatoes that Miguel is gonna photograph I'm going to do just a shower of fresh basil on it I'm just gonna take the leaves roll them up this is called julienne or Shifa nod [Music] my friend Miguel Flores viana and I have worked together for years he's been a respected magazine editor and now he's decided to become a photographer and he's very good he's coming today to photograph my garden I think I'll make him lunch and maybe something beautiful to photograph I'll make him an easy and colorful lemon fusilli with arugula followed by his favorite plum cake tatin and for photographing maybe some roasted tomatoes with fresh basil from my garden and for dinner tonight I think I'll make myself a salad with basil green goddess dressing with Miguel behind the lens I better be sure that these recipes are ready for their close-ups [Music] my plum cake thai tena is a twist on a classic French dish called tarte tatin which is made with apples but I'm gonna make it with plums instead so I'm gonna make a little bit of caramel with a cup of sugar and 1/3 of a cup of water it's gonna cook it over medium heat until it's nice and caramelized and brown wonderful and I'm gonna start cutting up the plum so I'm gonna cut these plums in half just take out the little pits which is sometimes not that easy to do these plumps are available sort of late summer early autumn and they're just wonderful they're called Italian prune plums if you want to make this cake another time you can make it with peaches or apples so delicious and it's really easy so I'm going to start with a 9 inch pie plate that I've greased and depent into 12 plums depending on the size of the plums let's see if these will make it round and when I take the plums and put them cut side down in a decorative fashion because this is gonna turn upside down you want them to be really pretty we put as many as you can in the packet okay last month I'd say that was perfect um the caramels already it's nice and warm too a very warm chestnut kind of color just swirl be sure you never stirred I'm just gonna pour it right over the plums and it's gonna make a wonderful caramel crust that's gorgeous why is Miguel out in the garden photographing you should be in you're photographing this so for the cake part of my plum cake take time for singing these six tablespoons of butter it's 3/4 of a stick 3/4 of a cup of sugar it's a pretty easy cake but it's got a little lemon zest in it so it's got great flavor I'm just gonna cream that together until it's light and fluffy Thank You mustard in the bowl I need two extra-large eggs it's trying to mix it down to low and put in the eggs one at a time just until they're really incorporated don't worry about over beating it now [Music] I'm just gonna scrape down the sides make sure it's well incorporated okay well that's Mexican only great some lemon zest that I have a teaspoon of lemon zest just that's really nice flavor to the cake batter and I think really complements the plums okay half a teaspoon of lemon zest and a half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract mmm you love that started a cup of sour cream [Music] yeah that's the sour cream those are the wet ingredients now I'm gonna do the dry ingredients I need a cup and 2 tablespoons of flour don't ask why 2 tablespoons it just works and actually when I measure flour I fluff it first with a cup of the spoon and then just level it off just to ensure this just roll them up like a little cigar and then just slice them hmm so function it's wonderful okay right on top of the tomatoes a little bit of flake salt always looks gorgeous in a photograph hi Miguel I've got tomatoes for

[Music] well if there's one thing I make over and over again its roast chicken it's a great thing for Jeffrey on Friday night but if it's a really good roast chicken it's special enough for company so this is a story of one roast chicken made lots of different ways the first it's gonna be really nice summer dinner in the garden so this is the story of a chicken it's going on a very long journey and we're going along for the ride so the first thing I want to do is make a roast chicken and then I'm gonna use the bacon then we're gonna gross the chicken with for a salad be nice and crisp in the salad then I'm gonna use the carcass of the chicken to make chicken stock and even after that I'm gonna use the leftover chicken to make chicken with tabbouleh but first the roast chicken so I'm starting with a big roasting chicken first thing I want to do is salt and pepper the inside of the cavity I've already washed and patted it dry lots of salt inside to give it lots of flavor and lots of pepper want this to have a great flavor and I'm gonna take a whole head of garlic I'm not even gonna peel it just cut it right in half and all that garlic flavor just gets right into the chicken really delicious and the next thing I wanna do is lemons because I love the way lemon tastes and chicken I'm just gonna quarter this and put that right into the chicken just that way and then some fresh thyme big sprig of fresh thyme right in the middle all this is really just to give the chicken more flavor as it roasts if you have other herbs around like oregano or rosemary or something like that you can also use that but I particularly like time now okay now I'm going to show you how to trust a chicken it's really simple I just want to do two things and then tie the legs together a little bit of kitchen string just tie these guys together this is really about making sure that the chicken cooks evenly if the legs are flapping around in the pan they're gonna cook faster than the rest of the chicken and the wings are the same thing you don't want them flapping around in the pan so what you want to do is just turn them backwards and tuck them right underneath the body of the chicken but it keeps them closed just like that I'm just gonna brush the whole tap with butter just to make sure that it has lots of flavor and that it Browns really nicely in the pan I'm going to sprinkle it with lots of salt and pepper and now comes the surprising part I'm going to put strips of bacon over the top which is gonna actually give it lots of flavor and then later I'm gonna crumble the crisp bacon into the salad so it's gonna be a combination of dishes this is the usual friday-night chicken but dressed up for company now I'm going to add more flavor to the sauce too by putting in garlic in the pan another whole head of garlic just cut right in half I'm gonna roast it in the pan and then this juices from the chicken are gonna make a sauce with the garlic and I think I'll put in two lemons so these are the flavours in the chicken but it's also going to add to the sauce cut off the ends and then just cut it in half and do big wedges and you'll see the lemon is gonna brown and it's gonna have great flavor right in the sauce just right in the pan it's sort of instead of vegetables my friend Greg Gail is coming for dinner it was internationally famous garden lighting designer and I think he's gonna do something incredible in my garden his so much style and he's so much fun and it's been really interesting to see this so we'll have a nice dinner in the garden with his lighting okay so I think it's already 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes and before it's done we're gonna take the bacon off so that chicken Browns really nicely and it looks like Greg's up to something really interesting out there love coming out and funny on my card for took cold beer thank you just what you needed right absolutely well this is amazing what is it well there's something local yeah there's something from another continent oh really theirs and their handles sort of all over the garden you know I can't wait to see it and I have a great fire okay great I'm cave alright I'm in the middle of cooking chicken you're still in charge of the garden absolutely I'm in charge of dinner good and mustard for my salad dressing so they'll make a salad dressing that's kind of thick but it's gonna be really good it's kind of lots of flavor the first thing I'm gonna do is have an egg yolk it's actually raw egg yolk so just be sure your guests don't have a problem with that but what its gonna do is emulsify the dressing so it's nice and thick one room-temperature egg yolk in the food processor 2 teaspoons of good mustard I like Dijon mustard two cloves of chopped garlic if that doesn't give it a lot of flavor I don't know what will half a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 teaspoons of salt salt everywhere F teaspoon of pepper all I'm going to do is I'm going to turn this on and emulsify it all and then very slowly pour olive oil into it and it's going to make it like a thick mayonnaise all the ingredients need to be room-temperature made one and a half cups of olive oil poured slowly and you'll see it's gonna start to thicken that should be just about right I'm gonna add half a cup of Parmesan cheese for even more flavor this makes a lot of dressing but it's kind of lasts about a week or two in the frigerator just mix that in and that's it I think it's gonna be delicious so it's thick but not like mayonnaise it's perfect consistency so good got a lot of lemon and garlic parmesan is really delicious and it it's gonna be really good on the salad with a crispy bacon on the top my friend Greg is gonna be very happy [Music] what does that look good Wow someone take the bacon off put it aside let it get nice and crisp and then I'm gonna crumble it on the salad later wonderful okay I'm just gonna baste it a little bit so it Browns nicely and the lemons and then back in the oven [Music] where's the smoke good these guys [Music] slightly higher and that in a little lower looking around I think that's about it - hopefully is inside cooking some chicken or something delicious and I think our work is done here now that looked like a chicken that looks go ahead eat just put this on a platter remember it's filled with all that time and lemon and garlic so when the juices run out it's got all that flavor now I'm just gonna take the lemon and the garlic in the pan laughs put on the platter with the chicken great get all the lemon nice big piece of aluminum foil let's gonna rest at room temperatures we stay really hot under the foil now for the sauce just going to take this whole roasting pan put it right on the flame high heat and now about half a cup of chicken stock or chicken broth but it's really looking good so I'm going to turn the heat down to simmer let that cook for a few minutes while it reduces and it gets a really really wonderful flavor and while that's going I'm going so just before the dressing over the salad just enough to moisten it for parmesan adds more flavor and now the bacon that was cooking on top of the chicken I'm gonna cut it up right into the salad it's great to have something crispy great and that's done okay I see how this little guy is doing wonderful it's still hot and the juices have all gone back into the chicken it's really juicy it's just not pink it's perfectly done it's not the first thing I do is take the leg off I'll just pull the leg up and then cut right through the joint are you about carving up a chicken is if you can't quite get your knife in just wiggle it a little bit and you'll find out where it goes okay so you cut the leg into a few pieces around the bladder cut off the wing some wonderful way to carve a chicken is cut the whole breast off in one piece and then slice it straight across every portion there's a little bit of the meat and the skin it's so much easier than slicing really fits nice and I think it tastes much better little pays final platter anything on the other side now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put some of the gravy right on the chicken big bunch of fresh thyme it may be a lemon since there's lemon in it so now my friend Greg is gonna know that it's thyme and lemon that looks pretty good and dinner [Music] my friends Mandy and John got married last year in Sri Lanka yeah and while I was there I found these in a small shop yeah but it's actually really natural earthy material help yourself Thank You lemon chicken my favorite it is so good would you like a leg and actually what I did was I I cooked some bacon with a chicken and then put it in the salad so help yourself to the salad ladies first thank you so what you don't know is this is only part one of the chicken story I'm gonna make chicken stock out of the bones that are left from the chicken so since I'm over to your house okay perfect okay you got it so there's part two to this dinner well that was really fun wasn't the garden amazing he's so creative so with the chicken carcass that was left over I'm gonna make chicken stock and it was a similar way while I clean up after the party so I've got the carcass of one chicken two big stalks of celery and you know you don't even have to peel them and throw them right in the pan two onions just cut this in big quarters don't even have to feel it parsnips great for this it's sort of like a cross between a carrot and a turnip I'm just big chunks right into the pot chicken stock so great to have them around for soups or stews but I need a little bit for the chicken with tabbouleh for lunch tomorrow so the next thing when I put in is a whole head of garlic it's really like making a chicken just cut it in half and just throw it right in some dill some parsley some fresh thyme and I actually just use whole peppercorns tablespoon or so of whole peppercorns and a tablespoon of salt no salt is so important for chicken stock if it doesn't have enough salt it tastes like dirty dishwater and then cover everything with water it's about four quarts of water so just bring it up to a boil and then we're gonna lower the heat and let it simmer for about three and a half hours and it's gonna be really rich wonderful chicken stock it's just the right amount of time to watch a movie so I'm just redoing the chicken stock so I can strain it oh it smells so good other vegetables cut gorgeous that is so it was basically just a leftover chicken carcass and some vegetables for my vegetable bin so I just need a cup and a half of chicken stock for the chicken was tabbouleh I want it nice and hot when I put it over the tabbouleh so I'm gonna just heat it up just like that so we'll just bring it to a boil meanwhile I'm gonna get the tabbouleh ready tabbouleh is actually a Middle Eastern dish and it starts with bulgur wheat which is a really good healthy grain and I'm gonna start with a cup of it just right in the bottom or a bowl we're gonna add the juice of two lemons this is actually going to be the end of the journey for this chicken because what I'm gonna do is use the leftover chicken and put it in the tubulin it's gonna be lunch so the chicken stock and the chicken but so that's two lemons just go straight it right into the bulgur wheat so I'm going to show you then pits in it great a quarter of a cup of olive oil 1/2 teaspoons of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and then the one-and-a-half cups of hot chicken stock just simmering and pour it right over the tabbouleh okay that's just going to sit there on the tube bulu she's going to puff up and absorb the oil and lemon juice and chicken stock [Music] so we're gonna cover this with plastic wrap to keep the heat in it'll let sit for about an hour and we've got to chop up all kinds of great vegetables something leftover chicken if I can't wait for lunch I love tabbouleh it's not only delicious but it's actually also good for you so it's the bulgur wheat that I've been soaking for an hour with lemon juice olive oil and some chicken stock and I'm just gonna add lots of great vegetables these are hothouse cucumbers that are great because they're they're sort of sweeter than regular cucumbers and you don't have to peel them lots of scallions you see this is really nice grain with lots of fresh vegetables in it scallions go right in and then I've got a cup of cherry tomatoes they're really just a nice big cherry tomatoes cut in quarters or cut in half if they're small right in and then fresh mint great for this now mint unlike other herbs you really do have to pick the leaves off because you don't want to eat the stems so I'm gonna make a huge bowl of tabbouleh and I'm gonna have a really good healthy lunch all week I want to chop them in pretty well because you don't want to eat big pieces of mint leaves it's about a cup of chopped mint then I need a cup of chopped parsley so good and healthy this is that was easier than the meant I'm gonna put the leftover chicken in this but you can really have it as a side dish or main dish without the chicken just plain cup of chopped parsley and the chicken I'm just gonna take the skin off and then chop it in big cubes and just toss it right into the Devoy I mean if you have salmon left over you can really be creative ok 2 teaspoons of salt teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna trust all together remember the lemon juice and the olive oil in the tabbouleh so it's gonna make the sauce my lunch and now I've got the rest of the chicken stock keep in the freezer [Music] for soups or stews but that's chicken story the sequel
[Music] my friends Billy Finkelstein and his wife Barbara coming to dinner tonight he's an LA screenwriter and she's a fabulous architect you know I know those guys in LA only have frozen yogurt and water for dinner I don't think so instead I'm making it over-the-top three-course meal for them and making pomegranate cosmos that are a delicious twist on an old favorite and to go with them salty fingerling potatoes to dip in the garlicky French aioli and then for dinner not one but two blue cheese soufflés I have a foolproof recipe and for dessert spicy apple turnovers that look fancy but they're really easy to make these guys are actually serious foodie so I've got my work cut out everybody always says they don't want to have to serve but I don't remember anybody turning it down in my house one of the reasons I think is because I really make traditional desserts sometimes I'll make them in a different way like this time I'm gonna make apple turnovers which are apple tarts when I'm doing them in puff pastry so the first thing I'm going to start with us three apples so I usually pick a fairly tart apple this granny smith apples but if you want to mix them sometimes that's nice during apple season you can get something like a mccune or a Empire Apple so three granny smith apples chopped up and then right away I want to put something acidic on there so they don't turn brown so I'm going to use some orange that a teaspoon of grated orange zest and three tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice that's about half an orange three tablespoons of sugar these are chart apples over a little sweetness one tablespoon of flour Creve teaspoon of cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg okay toss that together and then I'm gonna use dried cherries should be really good so the tartness of the cherries and the apples a really good balance for each other about three tablespoons okay just a pinch of salt I know it's surprising but it makes a big difference it's actually a good idea at this point to just taste it and just make sure it tastes right mmm just just like apple pie okay that's the filling I know I'm gonna make the pastry if times I feel like make my own pie crust and times I just don't this is one of those times and the good news is it doesn't make any difference it's gonna be really delicious so I'm gonna use a frozen puff pastry this is the layers and layers of layers of dough and butter and when you put it in the oven it puffs up and it's really nice and light so just gonna roll it lightly until it's 12 by 12 just make sure it's well floured just don't want it to stick to the board you won't be sure it stays really cold [Music] this sure beats making pie crust doesn't it okay 12 by 12 we're there [Music] so I'm going to cut this in quarters little bit of filling in each one so I'm just gonna put a little egg wash on all the edges and then when I crimp it it'll seal it should I have this works just fold it right over take the fork you just crimp the edges the way you would with the pie crust these are gonna get nice and brown sort of a golden-brown color and they're gonna be just gorgeous right on the pan just like that okay I'm just gonna finish the rest best thing is I can make this early in the day and just bake them before from serving them so we have nice hot apple turnovers these are pretty good [Music] and a little sprinkling of sugar and a little split to win it the steam when they bake okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake them off when my guests are here the whole house is gonna smell like apple pie i Michael arranger for dinner party of very chic friends coming so will you look in the fridge with me I need some inspiration got a problem okay not orange orange I had this idea that I want to do like a deconstructed French bouquet so maybe like white there's so many white and lime-green flowers but to do like a Vaz of each one individually and then I can just move them around on the table does that sound like it's not beautiful that does okay great so I know I need alchemy 'la maybe 20 steps perfect okay so how about a white half speed white lilac they're so beautiful white leather and wipe the lisianthus that would be pretty okay cool those two bubbles these okay that looks good that looks good an elysian yes oh this would be really pretty these the one in green and white parrot is a little touch of pink yeah beautiful I'll take these right too low it's gonna be gorgeous it's gonna be absolutely gorgeous we're gonna Mack a man whoa I think we have enough flowers one table [Music] my friends are coming for dinner and you gotta have cocktails I'm gonna make pomegranate Cosmopolitan's and the first thing I'm doing is getting those glasses ice-cold so this is really a traditional recipe very la Cosmopolitan's but with a twist and instead of doing it with cranberry juice I'm making them with pomegranate juice which is really good so the first thing I need is two cups of vodka I'm gonna make a lot at one time I hate making cocktails one at a time I'm just gonna pour them in a pitcher and then when my friends come we'll just shake them up with ice one cup of orange liqueur one cup of pomegranate juice I know it sounds unusual but you really can't find it and it's actually good for you can you imagine causing problems that are good for you and the last ingredient is half a cup of freshly squeezed lime juice it's a really important use fresh lime juice not a bottle to the variety just has that sort of very fresh kind of flavor [Applause] I remember the first time I had a cousin problem I thought wow that's serious I'm very used to them have a cup of freshly squeezed lime juice and that's it it's a nice big pitcher and then later when my friends come I'm gonna shake it up with ice and we're in a really good cosmopolitan I'm going to serve it with fingerling potatoes and dipped in aisle 8 how good is that [Music] well potatoes with eyerly are sort of a classic Provencal side dish but I thought wouldn't it be nice to have them for hors d'oeuvres a little bit of I only as a dip so what I have is fingerling potatoes to these wonderful incredibly hot Wow potatoes and I just like to cut them in half I'm gonna make an aioli dip I boil them for about 10 minutes and then I find it they cook so much better if I take them out before they're totally done and let them steam under a covered cloth for about 15 minutes so now for the I Olli I love this it's got so much flavor so what I'm gonna do is I've got one piece of bread this is used as a thickener for the i-league I'm just gonna tear it up into a bowl and add about two tablespoons of champagne or white wine vinegar and just let it soak for a few minutes and in the meantime I'll make the rest of it so garlic lots of it six big cloves of garlic and just chop it up it seems like every dish in Provence has lots of garlic in it it's so good okay into the food processor two egg yolks okay next thing is lemon juice and lemon zest I think it really adds a nice freshness to the aisle a half teaspoon of grated lemon zest okay got a half a teaspoon three tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice it's a little less than one large lemon what okay perfect half a teaspoon of saffron the stamens of crocuses and it's just so wonderful and okay one teaspoon of salt quarter of teaspoon of pepper and then we're going to do is take the bread that I've soaked it's gooey but it's gonna be good in the eye Olie just squeeze as much of the liquid out as you can perfect and I'm gonna puree the whole thing together and then just like with mayonnaise I'm gonna pour olive oil and slowly so it gets very thick I need one and a half cups of olive oil this is actually not the time for really strongly flavored olive oil I'm using pure olive oil rather than extra-virgin so I'm a little bit of olive flavor but not overwhelming and then just like with manna it's just pour it in really slowly and you see it gets very thick smell all the garlic and [Music] that looks good it's wonderful and really good a hit of garlic and lemon and the saffron should be really good with potatoes okay I'm just gonna clean up a bit I can really make a mess we're the aioli and to the ball this look gorgeous I love the color or to the egg yolks and that saffron and then I'm just gonna do potatoes right around the outside now that could this be hasn't pollens fingerling potatoes and I only needs dinner [Music] I'm gonna spray it with a little salt no pepper see how much more flavorful it looks and I was like to do a little chopped chive on it just think the green really has something to it and it is a little flavor too so chopped chive it looks great and it's delicious I think I might have to try one just to make sure it's okay it's so good the potato and the eye all the way together they're gonna really enjoy this with this and a blue cheese souffle and we'll have dinner ready [Music] so for the main course I'm gonna make blue cheese souffle not one but two I have to say I used to think it was a really scary thing to do but I tested it over and over again it's really foolproof okay so I have ten egg whites and eight egg yolks and these I'm just gonna stay for another time and lots of blue cheese I actually love to use good work for for this he's gonna chop it up if you like blue cheese you will love this souffle I just adore it okay blue cheese is ready I need two cups of milk heated should be that right what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a roux which is like a white sauce and then add the blue cheese and then just before serving I'm gonna whip up the egg whites put them in the oven people go crazy so I've got 6 tablespoons of butter melted and then need 6 tablespoons of flour so just sprinkle it on the butter I just want to cook the butter and flour for a minute or two it just really gets rid of that raw flour taste okay that's ready now and then Memphis hot butter pour hot milk into the so it combines pretty quickly I'm just gonna cook this for a minute until it's really thick it's the time whisk really helps pull it together well that's thick and I'm gonna add some seasonings so a pinch of nutmeg pinch of cayenne pepper teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper okay that looks great now off the heat you're gonna add 8 egg yolks just one at a time just whisk the limb this really makes a nice lunch or really like dinner just a wonderful thing he makes souffles all kinds of things on the chicken crab needs but I have to admit my favorite is blue cheese okay then the blue cheese I'm just gonna put it in and it's gonna just melt into the base and I have a cup of Parmesan cheese [Music] just stir that in and the cheese's will melt into the base okay I'm gonna pour this into two bowls and make two souffles out okay now for the egg whites so I have ten egg whites at room temperature it's really important for this quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar which helps them really hold their shape I think you saw and just turn it on high and listen as high as you can [Music] because otherwise they never get the volume might even clean up while they listen this is perfect I want the egg whites so they're really firm but not over whip so they're dry and I'm going to take the egg whites and do half in each Bowl there's a nice and light from the key to this is to fold it in without deflating the egg whites as much as possible so a sort of classic folding method is to cut down the middle of it and then fold your spatula and that and just keep turning it and turning it until you get a homogeneous mixture without deflating the egg whites too much I think this is the part that used to make me nervous but now that I've done them so many times it really is fairly foolproof so what I have is two souffle dishes and I've greased the inside and dusted it with Parmesan cheese okay that's one I'm gonna make the other one I don't know why I used to think it was so scary it's really not please go into a 400-degree oven I'm gonna turn it down immediately to 375 30 to 35 minutes and we will have to core just souffles wait till they come out they're gonna be amazing I'm setting a timer I don't want to forget these can't wait [Music] my friends are coming to dinner and I always feel like I've got a handle on the food but the table setting I'm never quite sure about so what I've done is I've gotten lime green and white flowers I'm gonna do table setting in just those colors so I'm going to do five roses with five different lime and green flowers so that's I'll Camilla I've got the gorgeous tulips I think the white lilacs are next gorgeous that is okay the next one I have is lisianthus I haven't won wacky pink one okay so the lisianthus i'm gonna put on this side so now I've got a huge bouquet of flowers in the middle and it was so much easier than doing a big bouquet so this looks really good put these away oh I think I heard they're kinda dry but just in time okay who wants a pomegranate cousin palm don't have any fun so get back [Applause] okay who wants a cosmopolitan and the pomegranate juice is so good for you two counteracts the effects of the vodka how's that okay guys I'm gonna go check on the souffle okay 400 degrees 20 minutes we're gonna have hot apple turnovers to dessert but I think this if lays are just about done oh there it goes good the moment of truth oh my god no isn't that a wow they look great no pizza tonight okay guys I think I did it blue cheese soufflés who would leave I knew this crowd would enjoy something more interesting so okay so what do you think well and I'm going to be brutal delicious okay who's ready for dessert is it a desire to play you never know I'll be right back mmm thank you and this one cream if anybody would like some farm I have a suggestion okay what about if we move in with you that way we could do this each and every day and I could cook for you because great now we're trying
so I've got two and a half pounds of ground chuck it's very important that it's not too dry you can ask the butcher boy and then I've got sauteed onions and lots of flavorings to give it lots of flavor I'll show you how I made the onions I heated a tablespoon of olive oil in a medium saute pan and then added three cups chopped yellow onions then I added a teaspoon of chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and just cooked it over medium-low heat stirring it occasionally for about 10 minutes just until the onions are translucent but not Brown then off the heat I added three tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce 1/3 of a cup of chicken stock 1 tablespoon of tomato paste then I mixed everything together and set it aside to cool slightly so now I'm just gonna add the onions and all that great flavoring to the meat everything's right in there it's gonna be delicious meatloaf next thing is bread crumbs I use about a half a cup of dried breadcrumbs I use dry once coz it really holds the meatloaf together and why make fresh bread crumbs when you don't have to to eggs which also holds the meatloaf together and then pour it on top that's the key to making meatloaf you want it to sort of aerate it you don't want it to be dense so just toss it all together and make sure you're not compacting it just have it lightly wanted to have an even shape so it cooks evenly if it's thicker one part than the other part of a little over cooking I'm gonna put a half a cup of ketchup right on the top this work and the hands come in just smooth it over you can really do it with a knife if you want to okay now I'm gonna put it into the oven fridge and fifty degrees about an hour an hour and 10 minutes this would be the most delicious kilo get a pan fill it with very very hot tap water and put it underneath you'll have moist delicious meatloaf every time and the way I can tell whether it's done or not it needs to be about 155 to 160 degrees instant-read thermometer and just put it right through the end it's the best way to make sure you get the center of it a little garnish make it look better and a little taste to make sure it tastes good at what beginner wouldn't want to make meatloaf mmm it's so delicious
[Music] my friends come for dinner during the week and they're expecting take-out pizza I love to Surprise them and make something really elegant like filet of beef with gorgonzola sauce it's absolutely delicious so what's more elegant for dinner than caviar dip and the truth is there's nothing easier either I'm going to just put a few ingredients together it's my kind of dish no cooking at all I've got eight ounces of cream cheese and half a cup of sour cream I'm just going to blend it all together let that go until it's nicely mixed and then I'm going to start adding my flavorings first thing is lemon juice for one lemon I'm not going to mess up the juicer so I just do it with this little reamer which is terrific kitchen tool so two teaspoons of lemon juice into the cream cheese and sour cream sauce and the next thing is dill and the easiest way to do the dill is just take the leaves off like that I need two tablespoons of chopped dill this is going to be so good with making filet of beef with a gorgonzola sauce it's so easy you won't believe it and roasted cherry tomatoes and clean wedges of baked potatoes and then I made one scallion chopped a lot of recipes just called for the white part of this guy but I love the green part like that you can see it in the dip this guy and is it's really wonderful for the pungent flavor spicy so one whole scallion chopped took in and one tablespoon of milk half-and-half just to thin it just ever so slightly I'm going to turn it on just to lift it up that just one nice factual I'm going to fold in the cavity I don't want to break those little grains I'll show you what I use it's salmon roe and I just love the way it works in this recipe it's so much less expensive this is so great because when you bite into these little grams of caviar they just pop in your mouth so worship of course use a little silver dish if you have one something elegant like this [Music] so good [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] I'm going to make roasted cherry tomatoes and all of these are gorgeous there are yellow pear tomatoes and these wonderful yellow grape tomatoes the sort of shape of a grade so I think tonight I'm just going to use ground red tomatoes and they're all organic so they're good I love the combination of strawberries and cream and I thought it'd be really fun to make a cake that had those flavors so I came up with a strawberry country cake it's a wonderful through simple white cake and I cut it in half and then I feel it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries I'm going to start with one and a half sticks of butter and two cups of sugar and cream these together it's nice light color it's really fluffy it's wonderful and now on most feeds I'm going to add the eggs I need four eggs I was crossing me to a bowl so there's a bad egg I haven't ruined everything I've made I'm going to add these eggs one at a time okay now it's all incorporated so next thing I want to add is dental cream so it's three quarters of a cup of sour cream and that goes in and the sour creams room temperature to it so it all gets incorporated nicely so first I'm gonna do a little orange zest but I have a teaspoon should do it so that's about a half a teaspoon half a teaspoon of lemon zest my favorite rasp so great okay I should do it that's going to go into the batter mix those in and a little vanilla these flavors are really subtle because I don't want them to overpower the strawberries and whipped cream after I sell the cake okay I've got all the wet ingredients now I'm going to do the dry ingredients I need two cups of all-purpose flour and quarter of a cup of cornstarch teaspoon of baking soda which is the leavening to make it rise and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and then on low speed just have the flower really slowly this is the point where you actually can over beat the batter so I do it on a low speed and mix it just until it's done and then into the pan divide them up evenly you have a little scale it's actually a great help but we'll just do it by eye so that's great so when a bake these both now once for the party tonight and what I'm going to freeze another party another time I bake at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes until it's a cluster comes out clean everybody loves french fries but not all that boy so I have a great way to make big potato wedges that are so delicious and they're baked in the oven this would be so good with the filet of beef and gorgonzola sauce okay so these are like chips without to be fat Franks I don't even peel the potatoes so each potato cut in half and then I cut each half in thirds so each one has six pieces what this size is pretty even but it doesn't have to be exact they're going to get really crisp on the outside and really tender on the inside put them at high temperature and people won't believe that they want fried okay that's a potatoes I'm going to drizzle it with olive oil toss it with salt and pepper and then you can use any kind of seasoning you like what I just I love garlic I'm just going to use a little bit like a teaspoon for the whole thing and maybe some fresh rosemary maybe another teaspoon just chop it up quickly I'm going to toss it all together good smell the rosemary it smells great and then to the line them up one side cut down then I'm going to put them in a 400-degree oven bake them for about 35 minutes and I'm going to turn them over to the other side so once one side Browns the other side will for about 20 minutes until they're brown on both they're going to be really good [Music] just because the food is fancy doesn't mean that flowers can't be really earthy I think flower ranges are really hard to do so I pick one kind of flower like this dahlias and I do lots of them it's elegant and it's easy aren't they gorgeous so much it should be done these are the strawberry country cakes and then fill with whipped cream and strawberries perfect cake doctor comes back to me that's great so I'm gonna let those cool for awhile I'm going to make a filet of beef a whole roasted tenderloin it's great and I'm going to show you the easiest gorgonzola sauce to go with it years ago when I was catering a party the chef gave me everything I needed for the party and she went oh my god I forgot to give you the sauce she'd forgotten to make it she handed me a quart of heavy cream and all the flavorings for the sauce and said just boil it I thought she was out of her mind but in fact it makes the best sauce so we put a quart of heavy cream in a pan and just boil it get it up to a high heat and then you just will lower the heat so it simmers for about 45 minutes and it'll thicken just like a white sauce and then we're going to add cheese I'll show you what kind this is going so you can get really two ways this is the best way we go is Italian it's just wonderful this gorgonzola Dolce and then this gorgonzola Mountain gorgonzola that has much more blue in it Dolce means sweet so it's creamier and sweeter but this is the kind that I want but also when you go to the grocery store you can also get gorgonzola that's like this it's not quite as good but it's fine and since I have the really good Italian one after all you someone explicit boil for a little while and so it gets nice and thick and then an advocate result could be really good the way this is sometimes called a beef tenderloin or a whole filet but when you get it like this it's called trimmed and tied and you want to ask the butcher for that it's got all the sort of silver taken off and it's all tied very neatly so it bakes in a very nice form around and it'll bake evenly though this is a big filet of beef it's probably between 50 and $100 to buy it but I have to tell you it feeds ten to twelve people and it's so easy to make every once in a while it's really worth doing so I'm going to tap the si dry so the seasonings stick to it and then I'm going to take about two tablespoons of room-temperature butter needs to be room temperature otherwise it won't read this is the messy part and just spread it all over the outside of this this is just going to keep it really moist and it's going to make a nice space for the salt and pepper I'm going to put on so you need about one tablespoon of salt seems like a lot but it's really the only seasoning and a tablespoon of pepper it's going to be really spicy but it's going to have wonderful flavor when it bakes so now this is going to go on a roasting pan and it's going to roast at 500 degrees now the key to this is you have to really clean up and otherwise you're going to smoke everybody out of the house 500 degrees for exactly 22 minutes it'll be rare for exactly 25 minutes it'll be medium-rare and it's going to be so good you won't believe it [Music] it doesn't get any easier than this for us to cherry tomatoes I've got a whole boulder from here you can use any kind these are just regular cherry tomatoes sometimes when I can get them great tomatoes are wonderful or yellow cherry tomatoes or pear Tomatoes whatever you can find and mix them it's really colorful if you can drizzle them with olive oil kosher salt freshly ground black pepper and I'm going to roast these in the oven at a high temperature 400 degrees for best 15 to 20 minutes and you won't believe how delicious they are and now for our favorite cake I'm going to cut it in half and fill it with strawberries and whipped cream if they don't come out really easily one of the things I do is just bang it on the board a little bit let's just let it feel whether it's loose enough to turn out turn it out take the parchment off and always lay down on the flat side that one's good pull the paper off tough small Sokka the vanilla in the zest so now the cakes are nicely cooled and the first thing I do is put one of the cakes in the freezer okay and now for our favorite cake then we're going to have tonight I'm going to cut it in half and fill it with strawberries and whipped cream they'll show you check I'm feeling shaky I'll take to fix and just put them halfway through and then I'll cut just above the toothpicks and I know my knife will cut it exactly in half and now it's perfectly sliced in half so it smells so good now the first thing is we have to do whipped cream that a cup of heavy cream and then while that's looking on the flavor is vanilla but it have to be spoon and some sugar so this is really see okay perfect so this is when the whipped cream is whipped it can go too far you end up with butter but it's really soft peaks and it's just gorgeous just like that and the next thing strawberries it's really like a strawberry shortcake but it's got cake instead of a biscuit place a little bit of cream on the cake big thick slices of strawberries place them with a point tipping out so you can see them peeking out inside the cake all the way around I'm going to find one gorgeous one for the top maybe two to save these guys for later now the top goes on big dollop of whipped cream on the top I love about this is sort of a country kind of dessert but it's still very elegant at the end of the day it's a simplest things that are really the most elegant it's a big strawberries on the top select only the stems on because it look more strawberry like [Music] the best relation is just ready gorgeous so good pitch looks so fabulous I'm going to put it on the board and let this rest so important to let me read it's going to reabsorb all the juices and cover it in foil keep it nice and warm and be perfect I'm already for dinner oh this looks great this is a heavy cream that I've reduced for the gorgonzola sauce and just silky and smooth and just sort of coats the wooden spoon just wonderful and now I'm going to add all the wonderful flavor so this is that gorgeous Italian gorgonzola that I had it's a mountain gorgonzola it's not Dolce it's a really pungent flavorful gorgonzola and I'm going to put about 4 ounces of gorgonzola right into the sauce sort of break it up a little bit and it's going to just melt into it it's gonna be really creamy oh so good and then I found another 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese really gives it a good flavor this is Parmesan that I already graded you don't want to use the stuff from the box in the grocery store get really good parmesan and grade it yourself it's so much better it was just left in refrigerator for weeks and weeks and then just 3/4 of teaspoon of salt a victory Cruz a teaspoon of pepper stir that up and see it all just melts together and the last thing on a Duke is playing a little chopped parsley which will give a really fresh flavor I actually think parsley is really under used as an herb so that's gonna be wonderful with roasted Salafis those big wedges of baked potatoes and the roasted tomatoes really good [Music] and now I have a minute to get ready before everybody gets here [Music] okay we're good we clicked xane right it all day right usual Thursday 90 the garden hello guys my food I know I usually have dipped all the way up the alders really my food and everything up if you don't know anything and here to play bridge [Music] [Music] six charge emitter perfectly cook and the potatoes nope look at the great garlic and rosemary little one here was not so little with my name on sole delivers so hot stays on the tomatoes if you have a patience to do this in julienne strips do it but I don't it's going to just delicious and the last thing is the gorgonzola sauce and dinner's ready [Music] my help so good because they're really firm to the register wonderful right now Thank You friendship and filet a baseless cortisol stuff right the paste and gorgonzola particularly so Gianna details are cut over here midwinter change perfect perfect spring cake when you're having a bad day [Music]
[Music] I love Italian food simple its earthy and it's so delicious my friend Rolando is coming to visit he has a company that imports the most amazing Italian products pasta wine olive oil I thought I'd make him a nice Italian dinner in the garden and I know he's going to bring some new products for us to taste we was have such a good time together my friend where London better Monday is coming for dinner since he's obviously Italian I want to make a really Italian dinner for him so we're gonna start out with a white bean soup that's pureed it's really good and then a leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic on the top and it's cooked over potato so it absorbs all that great flavor and then for dessert I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit with a mascarpone cream on the top so for the soup first thing I did was I soaked the beans overnight there are a lot of reasons why you do it but the best one is that the beans actually cook better if you do that so I'm going to drain them it's a pound of white beans okay now I have some onions cooking it's about 4 cups of onions that have been cooked in olive oil for about 10 to 15 minutes until they're sort of translucent and that's when I have the most flavor for soup and then because everything Italian that's garlic in it I'm gonna put two garlic cloves in this is the way to peel garlic really easily just / tuning up on it and hit it and the peel comes right off and you know since we're pureeing the soup I'm just gonna throw it in home and it just cook it for about 2 minutes until it gets a little softened it's beginning to smell good it doesn't even have white beans in it yet okay so next I'm going to do is just put the white jeans in just put them right in and then two quarts of chicken stock via KHOU many chicken stock it's always better but if you need it in hurry good canned chicken stocks just fine and then lots of seasoning two teaspoons of salt a lot depends on how salty the chicken stock is and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and then fresh rosemary and this is secret when you're doing soup just put the whole stock in and then at the end I'm just gonna fish the stem out and the rosemary will be right in the soup and Bailey's if you can get good fresh bay leaves they're wonderful so then I'm just going to raise the heat bring it to a simmer and I'm gonna let it cook for about 30 minutes until the beans are really tender and everything's very flavorful and then I'm going to put it through a food mill which will make it a puree but not like baby food it gives it lots of great tech certain can be delicious and I think Rolando is bringing some good olive oil so we're going to drizzle it on top before we serve it I'm very good but now I need more rosemary [Music] fresh rosemary love it it's gonna be great with the lamb rosemary actually doesn't last the winter in East Hampton so I always plant one plant and then what I like to do is dig it up in the winter and bring it into the house so it makes the kitchen smell great old winter this is actually very cool dish because what you do is you marinate the lamb with rosemary and garlic and then you roast it over a bed of potatoes so all those juices from the lamb and the rosemary and the garlic get into the potatoes it's so good so first thing I'm gonna do is get my lamb big lamb so what I did was I asked the butcher to bone a leg of lamb but just to leave the end of the sort of the shank end in and it just gives it a little better form this is one big like lamb really and it's trimmed and tied okay now for the marinade so the first thing I'm going to do is have a better tablespoon of fresh rosemary and again you just want to slide your fingers right down the stalk and just take any tough stems out that should be that that should be bad enough remember rosemary is really strong with flavored you don't want too much and about six cloves of garlic that's gonna go into it so usually I do this in a food processor I'm not big on specialized equipment but this little mini food processor is so useful for tasks like this so I'm going to put the rosemary and the garlic and tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper and about two tablespoons of melted butter right into this little processor this is gonna puree it it's gonna make a lot of noise too how's that pretty easy okay now I'm just going to put this rub it right onto the lamb and it's just going to infuse the lamb with great flavor and then when it's roasted over the potatoes the flavor the potatoes - Oh smell that garlic and rosemary I know it seems like a lot of salt and pepper but it has to season the entire lamb and the potatoes so that's just gonna rest on the meat for about 30 minutes while the flavors really get into the lamb I'm really good I'm gonna let that sit while I wash my hands [Music] and after the potatoes the herb roast is like a pound this is going to be so good all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay best potatoes and Italy is a little unusual I'm going to put in six cloves of unpeeled garlic so right in with potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes brown nicely and then right on top this gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic now I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot it's gonna be great and it'll be about an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half and then I'll take the lamb at later and let it rest for about 20 minutes it's gonna be really good for dinner so well that's cooking that's gonna be good understand sinister rosemary white bean soup I do have a rosemary thing going here don't I that's okay we like rosemary so the soups been cooking away for about 30 minutes and I think the beans look like they're just done just pick up one bean and squeeze it and if it's soft its soft and hot it's done I take out the stem from the rosemary that's all that's left and the bay leaf nobody needs to eat that and then I'm gonna put it all through a food mill and it's gonna come out really coarse and delicious and a lot of texture that way right from the pan if you don't have a food mill you can always use a food processor or even a blender but they end up much more pureed and unlike the texture of this and a food Mills not really very expensive so this is really a low-tech food processor okay the last you have to do this in a few batches with a food mill the handle always goes in one direction and then you turn it the other way to clean the blade and then start again and you don't have to go to the gym that day okay I think that's it so when I do is I'm gonna heat it up later and when I serve it a little bit of drizzle of olive oil always helps so this is actually pretty thick almost sort of like a vegetable puree so when I heat it up I'm gonna add a little chicken stock before I serve it okay I'm gonna let that sit while I go get the table ready it's really not a party until the table set I bet I can find something in the garden to put the middle the table what about choice [Music] that's pretty cool [Music] now is plenty honey I made dinner in the kitchen but you know I looked outside and the orchard was in bloom I thought why not just drag the table outside so here I am I'm always dragging this table everywhere wherever it's pretty that's where I want to be simple country plates simple glasses everyday silverware what to mix it up and it's my trick about how to put a napkin in a basket so at the end stay up so you take the napkin and then fold it in the middle and in the middle of the other way and then you have the really pretty edges to standing up for the bread oh and the flowers [Music] cuz I'm [Music] so I thought it's a leg of lamb and be nice have an unusual vegetable roasted fennel roast doors actually carry this now and it's an anise flavored vegetable which I'm not that crazy about when it's raw but when it's cooked it's really delicious it's one of those vegetables that I'd like to cook it a really high heat so it gets sort of brown and caramelized on the outside and it's just moist and really tender on the inside and then after I've roasted it I'm just gonna hit it with some Parmesan cheese and it gives it really good spiciness just be sure you cut it right through the course of the wedges stay together okay that looks good just going to olive oil salt pepper put it in the oven it's going to roast about 400 degrees for about an hour until it's really crusty and brown strip meant great flavor salt and pepper toss it together clean hands most useful kitchen tools how fast is that and into the evidence would be really good for the lamb [Music] so since we're having an Italian dinner I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit for dessert but of course you know I have to make it a little richer than math so I'm going to make a little sauce for it with mascarpone which is like an Italian cream cheese it's very thick and very rich I'm gonna flavor it maybe a little honey to give it a little sweetness just a bit of tablespoon tablespoon and a half oh it's good and messy I'm about quarter teaspoon of vanilla just a little drop of it and then since I love when something looks like what it is and a little bit of vanilla seed in it so you take a vanilla bean a great flavor and just run your knife right down the middle of it and you'll see there are these black seeds inside and if you just take the tip of your knife and just run it right along the middle of it those little black seeds come out I'm just going to put it right into the honey vanilla mascarpone I'm just smashing around so a little too thick I think I'm gonna need a little heavy cream for it I think a few tablespoons of heavy cream will make it thin enough so it's a thick sauce okay it's really sick mmm this looks really good and you can really see the vanilla staging that's gonna be perfect for dessert with fresh fruit so I think the land might be done so what I'm going to do is take it out put it on a platter and just let it rest for about 20 minutes some big way we're just going to cover it with foil to keep it warm and this allows the juices to get back into the land it's gonna be good [Music] I think the fennel might be ready to turn also yeah that's a little brown on one side and I think my friend Rolando is bring some really good parmesan so we put it on top okay back of the oven until it's nicely from [Music] yeah Rolando perfect timing nice sweetie I'm so so happy to see you listen I always come with incredible gifts do you think that's enough bread spread for the two of us I don't know it's a cheap barter about that okay tobacco your three different types of olive oil that hopefully you can use three different ways in your kitchen oh I think I have an olive oil tasting what do you think right okay cool now the reason why were you three different types of olive oil is because I thought that you could use them in three different ways in your kitchen one is for cooking yeah it would be nice cooking this one might be a lighter one but it would be not too powerful and too spicy so that you could taste your food when you're cooking it and the other one it would be a much more delicate one for like cooking or making pesto or making you know a roasted fish yeah the other one the last one is an unfiltered olive oil which would be really good for you to use only as a condiment as what we call in Tuscany attest a Tuscan ketchup is like we only use it like on the table oh so you would like to present your bread or use it in your salads all right I'm gonna pour a little bit in each one this is the one that you can use and every sort of like in when you make one nice hearty tomato sauce or you know something then which the olive oil will be just an emulsifier okay and this other one is a little bit more flavorful as well that comes from Liguria where near the Italian Riviera so there the olives are harvested in January so it's a little bit milder okay and this one and this one as we will see it alert green almost and this one is another filter olive oil so it's a very rich flavorful way to taste this now when you taste olive oil you always wanted one of the things that always you know we can talk about in Italy is that the most important thing is color is a very sign of quality and it's very important that when you have olive oil you should have them in dark green bottles light is a very bad enemy of olive oil really taste the olives in that it should be like an olive oil McClarty and all just being negative olives it's intense it's incredible and that's lighter one that's amazing okay now this one is a very nice flavor for you know grilled fish or making pesto this is the one day it's actually a little rounder in a funny way isn't it it's a little sort of softer more aggressive yeah so good so this is the really good one and this is the last one that I value that it's an unfiltered olive oil and because it's unfiltered you will taste more of a network's type of more the olives so we'll be tasting more like artichokes or just like artichoke it's wonderful it's a really good flavor and it's sort of um it's actually a little bit earthy err mm-hmm it's wonderful you know we have I'm making a white bean soup for you and I don't think a drizzle of this olive oil motherfucker I can't wait ha when we [Music] limbs been resting for about 20 minutes so it's perfect and I've taken the strings off and now all I need to do is carve it nice thing about this is it's boneless so you can really slice it anyway and be really good I'm just going to serve our big platter with all the vegetables together so it's a little bit of fennel so don't we need some parmesan on this Sun fennel fantastic okay so how much can white bean soup [Music] and maybe a drizzle of olive oil on the top I'd say well apartment so I'm gonna take this out you want to take the soup you like my chive plan what a perfect so what do you say in Italian buon appetito one uppity no you say much better than I do though so how long have we known each other I think it's already 10 years at least 10 years right please no Rolando has this incredible company manicotti that imports fabulous Italian products like pasta and all the olive oils in parmesan and just incredible and we had an incredible time it took us on a tour of Sicily that was way too much fun so much fun hmm I hope you like the suit it's really good the combination of the earthiness of the beans for the grassiness of the olive oil well I used olive oil on the potatoes and the garlic and the fennel a little bit on the lamb it's a very olive oil night so what did you use as a rap well it's absolutely garlic and rosemary it's a very simple thing but it really seasons it she looks delicious and really tastes great okay so you can make some ribs I mean tomorrow yeah I think we're gonna have lamb for a long time are you ready for a nice Italian dessert whatever nice I've made fresh fruit with a mascarpone sauce well that sounds perfect stay right here and I'll be right back okay into the bowls big dollop of mascarpone cream which has honey and vanilla in it and dessert is ready the most important thing to me about fruit salad is that each fruit tastes really good and the mascarpone is really delicious because sort of like bites and all together yeah well I mean it's kind of like olive oil anything with mascarpone others better right for next to tell you an adventure it's gonna really good let that sit well I wash my hands [Music] and after the potatoes the herb roast is like a pound this is going to be so good all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay that's the potatoes the next things a little unusual I'm going to name six cloves of unpeeled garlic so right in with the potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes brown glynn nicely and then right on top this gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot it's gonna be great and it'll be hour and a quarter to an hour and a half and then I'll take the lamb at later and let it rest for about 20 minutes and be really good for doing so well that's cooking that's gonna be good I'm taking the rosemary white bean soup I do have a rosemary thing going here don't I that's okay we like rosemary so the soups been cooking away for it's gonna roast about 400 degrees for about an hour until it's really crusty and brown it's got that great flavor salt and pepper toss it together clean hands most useful kitchen tools how fast is that and into the oven it's gonna be really good with the lamb [Music] so since we're having an Italian dinner I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit for dessert but of course you know I have to make it a little richer than math so I'm gonna make a little sauce for it with mascarpone which is like an Italian cream cheese it's very thick and very rich I'm gonna flavor it maybe a little honey to give a little sweetness just a bit of tablespoon tablespoon and a half oh it's good and messy I'm about quarter teaspoon of vanilla just a little drop of it and then since I love when something looks like what it is and then put a little bit of vanilla seed in it so you take a vanilla bean like a great flavor and just run your knife right down the middle of it and you'll see there are these black seeds inside and if you just take the tip of your knife and just run it right along it's gonna be great with the lamb rosemary actually doesn't last the winter in Easthampton so I always plant one plant and then what I like to do is dig it up in the winter and bring it into the house so it makes the kitchen smell great all winter [Music] this is actually very cool dish because what you do is you marinate the lamb with rosemary and garlic and then you roast it over a bed of potatoes so all those juices from the lamb and the rosemary and the garlic get into the potatoes so good so first thing I'm gonna do is get my lamb big lamb so what I did was I asked the butcher to bone a leg of lamb but just to leave the end of the sort of the shank and in and it just gives it a little better form this is one big leg of lamb really nice and it's trimmed and tied okay now for the marinade so the first thing I'm going to do is have a better tablespoon of fresh rosemary and again you just want to slide your fingers right down the stalk and just take any tough stems out that should be that that should be bad enough remember Rosemary's really strongly flavored you don't want to into it so usually I do this in a food processor I'm not big on specialized equipment but this little mini food processor is so useful for little tasks like this someone put the rosemary and the garlic and tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper and about two tablespoons of melted butter right into this little processor this is gonna puree it it's gonna make a lot of noise too how's that pretty easy okay now I'm just going to put this rub it right onto the lamb and it's just going to infuse the lamb with great flavor and then when it's roasted over the potatoes the flavor the potatoes - mmm smell that garlic and rosemary I know it seems like a lot of salt and pepper but it has to season the entire lamb and the potatoes so that's just gonna rest on the meat for about 30 minutes while the flavors really get into the lamb it's a really good gonna let that sit while I wash my hands [Music] and after the potatoes the herbal and then right on top this gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic now I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot it's gonna be great and it'll be about an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half and then I'll take the lamb at later and let it rest for about 20 minutes it's gonna be really good for dinner so well that's cooking that's gonna be good I'm just whipping stir rosemary white bean soup I do have a rosemary thing going here don't I that's okay we like rosemary so the soups been cooking away for about 30 minutes and I think the beans look like they're just done just pick up one bean and squeeze it and if it's soft its soft and hot it's done and I take out the stem from the rosemary that's all that's left and the bay leaf nobody needs to eat that and then I'm gonna put it all through food mill and it's gonna come out really coarse and delicious have a lot of texture that way right from the pan if you don't have a food mill you can always use a food processor or even a blender but they end up much more pureed and unlike the texture of this and a food nails not really very expensive so this is really a low-tech food processor a lot depends on how salty the chicken stock is and a half teaspoon of pepper and then fresh rosemary and this is secret when you're doing soup just put the whole stalk in and then at the end I'm just gonna fish the stem out and the rosemary will be right in the soup and Bailey's if you can get good fresh bay leaves they're wonderful so then I'm just gonna raise the heat bring it to a simmer and I'm gonna let it cook for about 30 minutes until the beans are really tender and everything's very flavorful and then I'm gonna put it through a food mill which will make it a puree but not like baby food it gives it lots of great texture Tain's could be delicious and I think Rolando's bringing some good olive oil so we're gonna drizzle it on top before we serve it I'm very good but now I need more rosemary [Music] fresh rosemary it's gonna be great with the lamb rosemary actually doesn't last the winter in East Hampton so I always plant one plant and then what I like to do is dig it up in the winter and bring it into the house so it makes the kitchen smell great all winter down the stalk and just take any tough stems out that should be that that should be bad enough remember rosemary is really strong with flavored you don't want too much and about six cloves of garlic that's gonna go into it so usually I do this in a food processor I'm not big on specialized equipment but this little mini food processor is so useful for little tasks like this so I'm going to put the rosemary and the garlic and tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper and about two tablespoons of melted butter right into this little processor this is gonna puree it it's gonna make a lot of noise too how's that pretty easy okay now I'm just gonna put this rub it right onto the lamb and it's just going to infuse the lamb with great flavor and then when it's roasted over the potatoes the flavor the potatoes - OH smell that garlic and rosemary I know it seems like a lot of salt and pepper but it has to season the entire lamb and the potatoes so that's just gonna rest on the meat for about 30 minutes while the flavors really get into the lamb it's a really good gonna let that sit while I wash my hands [Music] and after the potatoes the herb roast is like a brown this is going to be so good all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay best potatoes and Italy is a little unusual I'm going to put in six cloves of unpeeled garlic so right in with the potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes Brown Illinois side and then right on top this gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot it's gonna be great and it'll be about an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half and then I'll take the lamb at later and let it rest for about 20 minutes it's gonna be really good for dinner so well that's cooking that's gonna be good I'm just gonna stir rosemary white bean soup I do have a rosemary thing going here don't I that's okay we like rosemary so the soups been cooking away for about 30 minutes and I think the beans look like they're just done just pick up one bean and squeeze it and if it's soft its soft and hot it's done and I take out the stem from the rosemary that's all that's

if you don't have a food mill you can always use a food processor or even a blender but they end up much more pureed and I like the texture of this and a food nails not really very expensive so this is really a low-tech food processor ok the last you have to do this in a few batches with a food mill the handle always goes in one direction and then you turn it the other way to clean the blade and then start again and you don't have to go to the gym that day okay I think that's it so when I do is I'm gonna heat it up later and when I serve it a little bit of little drizzle of olive oil always helps so this is actually pretty thick almost sort of like a vegetable puree so when I heat it up I'm gonna add a little chicken stock before I serve it okay I'm gonna let that sit while I go get the table ready it's really not a party until the table set [Music] you ready to turn also yeah that's a little brown on one side and I think my friend Rolando is bring some really good parmesan so I'm gonna sit on top okay back in the oven until it's nicely brown [Music] yeah Rolando perfect timing nice sweetie I'm so so happy to see you listen I always come with incredible gifts do you think that's enough bread spread for the two of us I don't know what is it it's a chia barter about okay tobacco you're three different types of olive oil that hopefully you can use three different ways in

grassiness of the olive oil I bet I can find something in the garden to put the middle of the table worth a shot [Music] that's pretty cool [Music] I was planning on having dinner in the kitchen but you know I looked outside and the orchard was in bloom I thought why not just drag the table outside so here I am I'm always dragging this table everywhere wherever it's pretty that's where I want to be simple types of plates simple glasses everyday silverware let them mix it up and it's my trick about how to put a napkin in a basket so at the end stay up so you take the napkin and then fold it in the middle and in the middle of the other way and then you have the really pretty edges too standing up for the bread oh and the flowers [Music] how's Emma [Music] so I thought with a leg of lamb and be nice have an unusual vegetable roasted fennel most stores actually carry this now and it's an anise flavored vegetable which I'm not that crazy that one it's raw but when it's cooked it's really delicious it's one of those vegetables that I'd like to cook it a really high heat so it gets sort of brown and caramelized on the outside and it's just moist and really tender on the inside and then after I've roasted it I'm just gonna hit it with some Parmesan cheese and it gives it really good spiciness just be sure you cut it right through the course of the wedges stay together okay that looks good she's gonna olive oil salt pepper put it in the oven it's gonna roast about 400 degrees for about an hour until it's really crusty and brown it's got great flavor salt and pepper toss it together clean hands most useful kitchen tools how fast is that and into the oven s can be really good for the lamb [Music] so since we're having an Italian dinner I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit for dessert but of course you know I have to make it a little richer than math so I'm gonna make a little sauce for it with mascarpone which is like an Italian cream cheese it's very thick and very rich then I'm gonna flavor it maybe a little honey to give a little sweetness just a bit of tablespoon tablespoon and a half oh it's good and messy I'm about quarter teaspoon of vanilla just a little drop of it and then since I love when something looks like what it is and then put a little bit of vanilla seed in it so you take a vanilla bean like a great flavor and just run your knife right down the middle of it and you'll see there are these black seeds inside and if you just take the tip of your knife and just run it right along the middle of it those little black seeds coming out I'm just going to put it right into the honey vanilla mascarpone I'm just smoosh it around so a little too thick I think I'm a little heavy cream for it I think a few tablespoons of heavy cream will make it thin enough so it's a thick sauce okay it's really sick mmm this looks really good and you can really see the vanilla safety that's gonna be perfect for dessert with a fresh fruit so I think the land might be down so what I'm gonna do is take it out put it on a platter and just let it rest for about 20 minutes some big wing we're just going to cover it with foil to keep it warm and this allows the juices to get back into the land there's gonna be good I think the fennel might be [Music] I love Italian food simple it's earthy and it's so delicious my friend Rolando is coming to visit he has a company that imports the most amazing Italian products pasta wine olive oil I thought I'd make him a nice Italian dinner in the garden and I know he's going to bring some new products for us to taste it wasn't such a good time together my friend where London better Monday is coming for dinner since he's obviously Italian I want to make a really Italian dinner for him so we're gonna start out with a white bean soup that's pureed it's really good and then a leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic on the top and it's cooked over potato so it absorbs all that great flavor and then for dessert I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit with a mascarpone cream on the top so for the soup first thing I did was I soaked the beans overnight there are a lot of reasons why you do it but the best one is that the beans actually cook better if you do that so I'm gonna drain them it's a pound of white beans okay now I have some onions cooking it's about four cups of onions that have been cooked in olive oil for about 10 to 15 minutes until they're sort of translucent and that's when they have the most flavor for soup and then because everything Italian that's garlic in it I'm gonna put two garlic cloves in this is the way to peel garlic really easily just Petunia leaf on it and hit it and the peel comes right off and you know since we're pureeing the soup I'm just gonna throw it in home and it just cook it for about two minutes until it gets a little softened it's beginning to smell good it doesn't even have white beans in it yet okay so next I'm going to do is just put the white jeans in just put them right in and then two quarts of chicken stock get homemade chicken stock it's always better but if you need it very good canned chicken stocks just fine and then lots of seasoning two teaspoons of salt a lot depends on how salty the chicken stock is and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and then fresh rosemary and this is a secret when you're doing soup just put the whole stock in and then at the end I'm just gonna fish the stem out in the rosemary oh be right in the soup and Bailey's if you can get good fresh bay leaves they're wonderful so then I'm just going to raise the heat bring it to a simmer and I'm gonna let it cook for about 30 minutes until the beans are really tender and everything's very flavorful and then I'm going to put it through a food mill which will make it a puree but not like baby food it gives it lots of great textures could be delicious and I think Rolando is bringing some good olive oil so we're going to drizzle it on top before we serve it it's very good but now I need more rosemary [Music] fresh rosemary love it it's gonna be great with the lamb rosemary actually doesn't last the winter in East Hampton so I always plant one plant and then what I like to do is dig it up in the winter and bring it into the house so it makes the kitchen smell great all winter this is actually very cool dish because what you do is you marinate the lamb with rosemary and garlic and then you roast it over a bed of potatoes so all those juices from the lamb and the rosemary and the garlic get into the potatoes it's so good so first thing I'm gonna do is get my lamb big lamb so what I did was I asked the butcher to bone a leg of lamb but just to leave the end of the sword of the shank end in and it just gives it a little better form this is one big like lamb really and it's trimmed and tied okay now for the marinade so the first thing I'm going to do is have a better tablespoon of fresh rosemary and again you just want to slide your fingers right before I used olive oil on the potatoes and the garlic and the fennel a little bit on the lamb it's a very olive oil night so what did you use as a rub well it's actually garlic and rosemary it's a very simple thing but it really seasons it looks delicious really tastes great okay so you can make some British anaemia tomorrow yeah I think we're gonna have lamb for a long time are you ready for a nice Italian dessert whatever night I've made fresh fruit with a mascarpone sauce well that sounds perfect stay right here and I'll be right back okay and to the boys big dollop of mascarpone cream which has honey and vanilla in it and dessert is ready the most important thing to me about fruit salmon is that each fruit tastes really good and the mascarpone is really delicious because sort of like binds them all together yeah well I mean it's kind of like olive oil anything with mascarpone honors better right we're next to tallien adventure it's gonna really good let that sit while I wash my hands [Music] and after the potatoes the herb-roasted like a pound this is going to be so good all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay that's the potatoes and it seems a little unusual I'm going to put in six cloves of unpeeled garlic so right in with the potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes brown glynn iceland and then right on top this gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic now I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot it's gonna be great and it'll be about hour and a quarter to an hour and a half and then I'll take the land met later and let it rest for about 20 minutes it's gonna be really good for dinner so well that's cooking that's gonna be good I'm taking the rosemary white bean soup I do have a rosemary thing going here don't I that's okay we like rosemary so the soups been cooking away for it's gonna roast about 400 degrees for about an hour until it's really crusty and brown it's got that great flavor salt and pepper toss it together clean hands most useful kitchen tools how fast is that and into the oven s can be

[Music] 25 years ago when I used to work an energy policy in the White House I used to dream of a job where all I had to do was cook all day long I've got a really busy day today and everything involves cooking how great is that first I'm making toasted coconut marshmallows for a friend who's having a bake sale then two women in my office are coming for a lunch meeting and I'm making delicious croque monsieur and a really refreshing french drink ice-cold cassis with water I have a brand new recipe to test fresh tuna salad that I think will have avocados red onion and a blend of Asian spices and then at the end of the day I'm gonna use some leftover roasted vegetable and make a delicious soup for myself for dinner sure is a different kind of day than when I used to write energy issue papers for the president I've such a busy dinner today but the first thing is I've promised to make something for a bake sale I'm sure they've got lots of cookies and cakes so I've decided I'm gonna make toasted coconut marshmallows so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of cold water and three packages of gelatin I'm just gonna let them stand until the gelatin dissolves and in the meantime I'm gonna make a sugar syrup 1/2 a cup of water one and a half cups of sugar make sure to serve with that sugar one cup of corn syrup corn syrup is like a concentrated sugar syrup it's gonna be really intense quarter teaspoon of salt [Music] I'm just going to cook this on high temperature until it gets to 240 degrees and the way to tell is a candy thermometer just stick it right in at the bottom of the thermometer right in the bottom of the pot and just cook this on high heat until that's right up to 240 degrees [Music] 240 degrees exactly so watch what I'm going to pour the sugar syrup into the gelatin slowly and swimming marshmallows [Music] be careful pouring this it's incredibly hot turn this on high speed for 15 minutes while I get some other flavors here's the coconut it's sweet inflate coconut I'm gonna toast it and then it's really great on the toasted coconut marshmallows toasted coconut all you need is coconut and a dry pan and you have to pay attention because it burns really fast I'm cooking it gets hot really smells wonderful just keep it moving around until it's looking like a nice light brown color these marshmallows are so good just by themselves just vanilla but toasted coconut really adds a great flavor you can see it's just starting to brown and it smells fabulous that looks perfect it's just a golden brown okay now I need to add a tablespoon of vanilla this marshmallow mix what you see that's amazing what went in was gelatin and sugar and what came out is marshmallow that great so I'm gonna take half the coconut and put it in the bottom of this pan 8 by 12 inch pan but whatever size pan that's closest on lightly the marshmallow mixture I just think it's like magic and with wet fingers just smooth out the top dirty marshmallows now I'm going to take the rest of the coconut and just sprinkle it lightly on top all over [Music] so I'm just going to let this sit unwrapped at room temperature until it dries out enough so I can cut it in squares [Music] my lunch meeting I'm gonna make croque monsieur which is a french ham and cheese sandwich it's so good I thought as long as I'm having a French theme why not continue it then we make SC solo for drinks which is cassis which is a black currant liqueur with water it's not too alcoholic but enough [Music] [Music] in about a tablespoon of kippis the same liquor that's French use for kir Royale with champagne but today we're just gonna do it with water I don't want any drunken meetings it's so refreshing and I know it is it's gonna be so good with Christmas here so one help yourself to a pussy solo Oh Cheers she did good times in the office okay done that's for you Shanae thank you I'm gonna don't have any fun till I get back [Music] first one into business I made a rule for myself that I would never hire somebody I didn't want to have dinner with and the end result is I love the people I work with so I'm gonna make them really nice lunch so I think I'm gonna make crook miss cheer which is like a French ham and cheese sandwich so the first thing I need to do is make a roux which is a white sauce I need two tablespoons of butter melt that three tablespoons of flour and you just dump the flour in all at once cook it over low heat just for about a minute or two until the flour is a little bit cooked white sauce is a really convenient thing to know how to make it's great for thickening things like chicken pot pie it's great in grams now what I'm gonna do is add two cups of scalded milk let's make the food just below the boiling point I'll just cook that until it thickens just stir it the whole time so it doesn't burn okay it's thick just below the boiling point so now I'm going to add teaspoon salt half a teaspoon of pepper and a pinch of nutmeg it's classic and white sauce 1/2 a cup of Parmesan cheese and half a cup of grated Gruyere and it's all just gonna melt together in the sauce so it's really nice cheese sauce the lots of flavor because the parmesan in Korea tastes very different it gives her a real depth of flavor it looks good okay now I'm going to assemble them so what I've done is I've toasted the bread taken off the crust and I bake them at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes turn them in baking another two minutes and they're ready to go now what I'm gonna do is put a little mustard on one side [Music] purpose here is a classic French lunch and any good cafe and friend has croque monsieur or crook madame which has it's exactly the same thing with a fried egg on top so get it thinly sliced a really good either baked Virginia ham or a black forest ham something like that and then sprinkle some Gruyere right on top [Music] and put the other slice on top of that little bit of a cheese sauce really cheesy brie on top so to bake these at 400 degrees for five minutes and then I'm going to broil it for three to five minutes it'll be nice and brown and crusty on the top hide from the broiler I don't what bad do they lunch is ready this is my idea of what a business meeting should be this year just a French ham and cheese sandwich after this I'm gonna test a tuna salad recipe fresh tuna so if it's any good I'll bring it to the office for you so why don't we do this every day we'll need to Siesta that's why we don't do this every day I'm trying to figure out a new recipe sometimes I start with an old favorite and update it in some way so I wanted to make a fresh tuna salad and I thought I would start with tuna tartare which is raw tuna but I think I'm gonna grill it and add some vegetables like avocados and red onions we'll see how it goes Deanna people ask me all the time how do I develop a recipe I'm gonna do one right now what I generally do is take an idea of something that's very familiar in this case I'm going to do tuna salad but I make it better than you can imagine by taking fresh tuna instead of that canned stuff so I'm gonna make a fresh tuna salad I've got Center cut fresh tuna from the loin just brush it with olive oil salt and pepper meanwhile the pans gonna get very very hot we leave it on high heat for about a minute so I can really sear the tuna into the pan [Music] oh it's smoky but that's the right way to me about two minutes on one side two minutes on the other side and then don't let it cool slightly these are gonna cook really fast looks like it's ready to turn yeah that was actually faster than I thought it's done in one minute on the second side Wow okay I'm just gonna let it cool slightly [Music] perfect I don't know that on the recipe too great okay now for the vinaigrette so four tablespoons of olive oil two and a half teaspoons of kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper the great festival I'd 1 teaspoon of wasabi powder wasabi is like a Japanese horseradish it's really hot six tablespoons of lime juice which is a little more than a third of a cup and a little soy sauce give it an Asian flavor let's see two teaspoons of soy sauce a lot of flavor something though check in the pantry and see if I'm inspired let's see I've got crushed chillies Chinese chili paste but I think Tabasco is gonna be perfect for this that's it [Music] I'm quite enough I think it's the right ingredient though think of that Tabasco is you can always add it but you can't take it out so I do it slowly perfect I'm always looking for that know when it goes but ten dashes of Tabasco it is wow that's good okay no that's it the tunas perfectly cooked see how it's raw in the middle or very very rare and cooked on the outside it's great yeah I think dicing is gonna be the way I'm gonna go big chunks this is not your mother's tuna salad I just put them on the plate good thing about this salad I think it's gonna get better as it sits as the flavors get into the tuna gonna add some red onion diced and some chuck scallions I use the white and the light green parts it has lots of color and also flavor and avocado with avocado you want to put it in something acidic like the vinaigrette so doesn't turn brown so I'm just gonna put it right into the vinaigrette and then pour the vinaigrette and the avocado one over the salad I think that should do it it's really good I'm gonna write this up on the computer before I forget it I was actually really interesting I always learned something when I'm testing a recipe I thought it was so interesting that the tuna cooked much faster than I expected and the other one is that one ingredient can make such a difference and I think the ten drops of Tabasco sauce really brought out the flavor and the other ingredients I'm gonna test this many more times before I'm done but first start I thought it was pretty good [Music] so the next thing I want to do I'm gonna take out these toasted coconut marshmallows great they're a little gooey but they dry enough to cut so it's perfect I can actually sit at room temperature for a day or two when a dust that the sides with confectioners sugar pack them in bags with ribbon another thing on the mega mole soup leftover vegetables for my supper just packing up the last of the toasted coconut marshmallows for the bake sale tomorrow I hope they're a hit you can find these bags sometimes at party stores craft stores or online nice piece of ribbon you just hold the bag open so it flares at the top pull it tight and they're all ready for the morning well I've had a really hard day I can see myself on the sofa good movie and a really easy dinner and the secret to a really quick meal is leftover vegetables I'm gonna make a vegetable soup from vegetables that are leftover from last night's dinner parsnip carrots potatoes go right into the blender they were all rested at a high temperature a little olive oil salt and pepper very simple and this is the other secret leftover salad with garlic vinaigrette who would put that in soup but it's all the ingredients you would have anyway oil garlic a little vinegar and greens just get them all in there and then I'm gonna put hot chicken stock that I had in the freezer in its pour some in we're gonna puree it and then see how thick it is no more chicken stock you can really do this with any kind of vegetables you want to have in soup [Applause] and not too pureed I like a lot of texture I'm just gonna reheat it and I'm gonna have soup for dinner perfect a friend of mine says this is a great way to get vegetables into our kids they don't even know they're vegetables and I think it's a great way to clean out the refrigerator but for right now that's a great quick dinner and good for it [Music] it's a good crusty bread and that's a really busy day there's nothing like a nice quiet night at home [Music] [Music]
[Music] even though my professional life is about cooking the truth is I hate cooking non-stop it's just too exhausting I've invited friends for dinner two nights in a row so I'm making a plan and to make the first dinner in advance I'm making a loin of pork with fennel stuffing it's so delicious and for every one of the things they don't like vegetables a cauliflower gratin that's surprisingly out-of-this-world and crisp green green vegetables sauteed with lots of shallots and for decadent finish pumpkin mousse parfaits creamy layers of pumpkin and whipped cream with spicy ginger cookies in between it's a party that's a holiday celebration but it's great for a celebration any time of the year but I'm entertaining I'm a few really important rings one of them has always served cocktails but the second one is I always try and make things that I can make an advance so I can prepare them refrigerate them and then just throw them in the oven before dinner not easy to find vegetables that you can make in advance but gratins are terrific potato gratin like to make zucchini great an for this dinner when I call a flower Gretchen so I've got a three pound cauliflower I'm just gonna cut it up into florets now okay big pot of boiling salted water that's a slow boil for about five or six minutes until the cauliflower is just tender in the meantime I'm gonna make a delicious white sauce first thing I do is I'm gonna heat up two cups of milk in the meantime grate some cheese I need about 3/4 of a cup of green air about half of the cup is gonna go into the sauce and then I'm gonna put some on top it's all brown and delicious okay so about two tablespoons of butter okay three tablespoons of flour all at once so I'm just cook the flour and the butter together it actually becomes like a paste just gonna pour the milk right in whoa really hot and then just stay this and you see it really thickens up so it's a really good white sauce no it's really nice and smooth now actually you can see it really coats the back of the spoon nicely okay it's thick enough I'm just going to turn it off the heat and add some great flavor first this salt and a teaspoon of kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper and the next thing is really classic French spice so quarter of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then lots of delicious Gruyere cheese about a half a cup and I had parmesan it's not so classic for French Greta knows but it gives it a nice nutty flavor better half a cup of grated Parmesan and then just stir together smells so good you can really smell the nuttiness of the gray air and the spicy parmesan and even nutmeg okay that's done I think cauliflower is ready [Music] and I steam bath this is the Grattan dish I'm gonna use it's about an 8 by 11 but it doesn't have to be exact so the first thing I do is put about a third of the sauce in the bottom it even looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't and then the cauliflower and then the rest of the sauce that actually looks good already but I'm gonna make a nice crumb topping so it gets brown and crusty it'll be so good okay so I need a little bit of butter so it's a quarter cup of breadcrumbs quarter of a cup of Greer just gonna mix this together I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top and then just drizzle it with a little bit of butter never hurt anything I'm just gonna leave that to room temperature and refrigerate it and bake it just before the party [Music] okay so the next vegetable I'm gonna make it's also great to make an advance I call its green green spring vegetables so first I'm going to do is cut off the ends of the asparagus and just cut them on a diagonal the ends are pretty hard so you don't eat those and then put it in the boiling water and blanch them really quickly you want them crisp tender next thing I'm going to do was french stream beans these are called Eriko vert what I do maybe quarter a half a pound of each vegetable it doesn't really matter it's just cut off the ends of the string beans and by now the asparagus should be done this is a great thing it's a Chinese strainer and it's great for lifting vegetables out of hot water I'm just gonna put them in ice water to set the color and stop the cooking you want them a little tender but not completely done okay then the stream beans go in same water and the next thing I have is broccolini I find it really tender and delicious now okay string beans are done happens fast right into the same ice water and then the broccolini and the last vegetable is sugar snap peas the good news is they already come with the end snap so you don't have to do it yourself now get broccoli nice really fast it's done right into the same ice water I'm gonna go the sugar snap peas just about 60 seconds perfect I'm gonna drain these I'm gonna put them in the refrigerator and they'll be ready to saute with showers but enough of the vegetables it's time for pumpkin mousse parfait [Music] this is so wonderful it's a parfait and a tall glass and it's got pumpkin mousse and layers of whipped cream and crumbled cookies it's just delicious the first thing you need though it's quarter of a cup of good dark rum I love this it just smells like the Caribbean to me and we're gonna do is dissolve one packet of gelatin right into the rum just gonna let that soak for a minute and then I'm gonna heat it up and add it back in so first thing I need is one can of pumpkin you can make it from a real pumpkin or you can use this this actually tastes better pumpkin can be really stringy and right out of the can it's just delicious so it's a 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree and I need 1/2 a cup of regular sugar half a cup of light brown sugar just lightly packed is the way its measured okay that's it half a cup of light brown sugar I need two egg yolks and now to get lots of good flavor I'm gonna put in 2 teaspoons of orange zest right in I need half a teaspoon of cinnamon half a teaspoon of salt quarter of a teaspoon of nutmeg I'm just gonna stir it all together mmm this already smells good I love the orange and cinnamon together that looks gorgeous color okay gotta make a mousse out of it I'm gonna take the gelatin I'm gonna heat it up and then add it back in so you'll see that it's a little lumpy when it's softened but when it's dissolved with heat it's really liquidy so that's perfect okay so I'm just gonna pour this right into the pumpkin mixture such a great it may smell the room when it gets hot and what this is gonna do is when it's refrigerated the pumpkin mousse is gonna set just mix it in okay so I need 1/2 cups of heavy cream we want it to be cold before you start because it'll whip so be careful at the end perfect so I'm just gonna take this whipped cream and fold it in for the pumpkin mixture and that's gonna really lighten it and make it sort of like moosie okay now the best way to fold something is to put your spatula through the middle and then fold it over and then turn the bowl and fold it over and that way you don't deflate the cream and you get really light mousse so now what I want to do is I'm gonna layer the pumpkin mousse whipped cream and cookies ginger cookies so the next thing I need to do is make more whipped cream but this time I want to make sweetened whipped cream so I'm gonna have one cup of cream doesn't have to be exact one tablespoon of sugar and one teaspoon of vanilla loves good vanilla I'm just gonna whip that up [Music] so this is what I'm going to put the new thing don't over with it otherwise I mean liquid butter I've actually found if you use a pastry bag it's clear sweeter so I put the muesli bag if you have a pastry bag with a round tip just a plain round tip or even any kind of a big tip I'll show you how quickly it goes just put about a third in the bottom okay so that's the first layer of mousse a little layer of whipped cream now because I love things that have different textures so the most creamy the whipped cream sweet I'm gonna have some crumbled ginger cookies so when you bite into it you get something that's creamy something that's smooth and something that's crunchy it looks great too doesn't that one on the layer of pumpkin [Music] now another layer of whipped cream a little bit top of each one more ginger the last layer of pumpkin well that worked out perfectly [Music] and just so everybody knows we stock it what's in it little ginger cookie decoration on the top and doesn't that look like the party just fridge right that and then I'm gonna make quad of pork with smell stuffing it's gonna be really good [Music] so I want to make a special meal but it doesn't mean it has to be complicated so for the main course I'm gonna make loin of pork and stuff it with fennel show you how to make it so I've cut up about 2 cups of onions just rough chop okay now I need 2 cups of sliced fennel I'm just gonna take out the core I love the anise flavor of this can already smell it it's wonderful and then just slice it thinly so that should be about 2 cups just gonna let this cook for about 15 minutes until the onions and fennel attender and then the fennel gets really sweet wonderful flavor in the meantime let me get some garlic ready and fresh thyme give it lots of flavor some chop the garlic no the thing about garlic is I don't want to put it in too early because it burns really quickly so just let the onions and fennel cook and then put the garlic and at the last minute just a rough chop and then fresh thyme I really prefer to use fresh herbs when you can alright let's see how the onions and fennel just toss them we don't want them to brown too much oh this is beginning to look good I just want to add the garlic add the fresh thyme just chop it up a smidge just release all the oil from the time teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper okay now I'm just gonna add a little bit of wine and what that's gonna do is to glaze the pan it's gonna scrape up all those brown bits that lots of flavor hmm this looks great smells even better okay I'm just gonna turn the heat off and let that sit it'll cool off while I make fresh breadcrumbs so fresh breadcrumbs I'm just going to take white bread cut off the crusts I'm just gonna dice it it's gonna be nice fluffy bread crumbs crumbs [Music] okay now I'm gonna unroll the pork so what I've asked the butcher to do is to butterfly it like a letter so it's in three parts and it's gonna open like that so just see let's see yeah that's perfect okay in a salt and pepper it season it well because you want to make sure it has lots of flavor fresh pepper so now I want to put the bread crumbs into the stuffing so about three cups of fresh breadcrumbs into the cooled fennel and onions and that's gonna really bind it and hold it together so when the loin of pork is sliced the stuff and won't fall out them okay so it's nice and cool now I'm just gonna put it right on top of a loin of pork if I'm gonna bake this right away it doesn't matter whether the filling is cooled but since I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator and bake it another day I want to be sure kind of like the Thanksgiving turkey but the stuffing is really cool and I'm gonna roll it up like a jelly roll just like that and you want to end fat side up like that doesn't have to be perfect okay now just gonna tie it up with butchers string you can find this in any cookware store there are all kinds of fancy ways to tie this but just not at the top is totally fine because I'm gonna take it off before I serve it anyway and what this is gonna do is keep the wanted work in a really nice shape they'll keep it nice and round and keep the stuffing in and that way also it cooks evenly and okay now I'm just gonna rub the top of this with a little olive oil oops I put a lot of olive oil salt pepper okay into the fridge and it's gonna be all ready to go into the oven for my dinner party [Music] what a day lots of shopping the good news is dinner's ready it's in the fridge I'm going to put it in the oven saute three vegetables and dinner's done okay that's gonna roast 425 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes and then we're gonna lower the temperature to 350 and it's gonna go for about twenty to thirty minutes until it's exactly one hundred thirty seven degrees [Music] the cauliflower got tan I'm gonna bake at 375 for about 25 to 30 minutes and you know great ends aren't that sensitive if you leave one of them put it in with the loin of pork so I'm just gonna chop up three shallots how you doing over there the string is done but I need to just show me how you had a car do that yeah so I'll show you I'll do one or two how's that that's perfect so the knife should be pretty sure what you want to do is use the blade back and forth see the family do it too soon because I want the filling to fall out easy okay back to the vegetables inside the oil and the butter all melted I'm gonna put in three shower sort of chopped up it's a great way to make vegetables when you have company because all I'm doing it's gonna reheat them with a shower [Music] [Applause] okay I'm done are you doing over there I am done that's it a dish of the time it doesn't it can really smell the fennel can check looks great a little parsley always helps right okay are you in charge of this I am thank you and can you take this - absolutely I'll be very much calls like four at ten it smells so good it's a party [Music] [Laughter] you know there are people do you think [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
and he thinks we'll have fun together so I'm doing the food and Michael's hosting the party I'm making a delicious roasted sea bass with shrimp and mussels with couscous and pine nuts on the side and for dessert crisp meringue shells filled with stewed berries and whipped cream [Music] like that I made a deal that I would do dinner and he's gonna do the table setting so we each get to do exactly what we want to do so the first thing I'm making is meringues and make meringue shanty which is meringues with fresh berries and whipped cream how bad can that be so I need six egg whites just the whites okay into the mixer then turn it on and whip it up quarter to teaspoon of cream of tartar which gives them volume big pinch of salt for flavor one cup of sugar at it slowly okay those go on high-speed and while those with I'm gonna put the pants ready so I'm gonna make individual meringues for each person so even take a measure I'm using three and a half inch measure I'm gonna draw circles a piece of parchment paper and a half she can and then what I'll do is I'll pipe each of the meringue disks inside the circle so I know that they're all three and a half inches so just to make sure that the meringue doesn't end up with pencil marks on it I'm turn this piece of paper over and just pack them on the top okay let's see how the minds doing I they look great they're very high volume they're whipped their firm need a little bit of vanilla half a teaspoon just to give it lots of flavor okay well the only thing I've put in now is a half a cup of sugar I put some sugar in the beginning but I'm gonna put this in the end it makes a much tenderer meringue if you fold the last half a cup of sugar in okay half a cup of sugar just bring it on I'm just gonna fold it in with a spatula it's actually surprising what a difference this makes I actually love meringues after a big dinner it's a really nice sort of light dessert I like to make them individual meringues like this filled with berries I like to make pavlovas their big disks filled with whipped cream and fruit or chocolate okay I'm just gonna fill a piping bag the biggest bag you have with a big star tip is great and guess what if you don't have a piping bag you can just do it with a spoon and just form those little shells but I'll show you how to do it with a piping bag Akili great it's a really messy job let's start on the edge make a circle around the edge and then come straight inside so I'm making a flat disc and then I'm gonna make an edge around the outside that's it actually maybe I'm gonna start from the center and go around the outside that's even better and then just keep building up the edge so you end up with a nice shell and the good news is if you do one that you don't like and just put it right back in the bag you turn over the ends so that when you turn them back it's nice and clean right Han this is something you really don't want to do on a rainy day the meringues end up you find that everybody's had meringues that are sort of chewy it's cuz they they it was too much humidity in the air really makes a huge difference surprising but it's true but you can store them for a really long time in an airtight container so find a really nice day and you can make them in advance okay I'm gonna be covered in meringue by the time I'm done with this okay just start the circle I'm going to fill these with whipped cream and berries at the party so they don't get soggy okay into the oven 200 degrees for two hours it's a cool oven so they get nice and crisp but not browned and I can't wait to see what Michaels doing the table is such a fabulous florist so instead of doing a flower centerpiece I decided to just do a big mass of green grapes and this way if the girls get hungry which I doubt they will they can just steal a grape which I think I'll do hmm and then just to make the centerpiece a little more special so it doesn't look like a big bowl of grapes I just went and picked some vines out in the garden and just tuck them around meringues are only as good as what you put in them so I'm gonna make stewed berries and some whipped cream so in order to make the stew berries I'm gonna take a half a pint of fresh blueberries have your kind of fresh raspberries third of a cup of water six tablespoons of sugar what's a quarter of a cup it's four tablespoons so I need one and a half I think I'm gonna do some orange zest because they'll give the raspberries and blueberries a little depth of flavor about a quarter of a teaspoon a freshly grated orange zest I like when something has a little extra flavor sort of like an under flavor that it doesn't overpower it just to sort of hit you quietly so quarter teaspoon of freshly grated orange zest I'm just going to turn this on so this just needs to come to a boil and then I'm gonna lower the heat and cook it for about eight to ten minutes until a little syrupy and I'm gonna add some more fresh fruit I think it might need a little hit at the end to something like cognac or liqueur little bit that's gonna be I think I'll just check out the pantry lower thee so I'm always looking for that one thing that like brings out the essence of a dish you don't really know it's there but it just tastes incredible so for the stup berries black currant liqueur cassis a little too bitter oh I know front woz it's raspberry liqueur and it's really gonna make the berries come alive so this looks done it's been simmering a little bit it's a little syrupy a little Framboise about two teaspoons just enough to give it a hit again just a little flavor but not to overpower it and now off the heat I'm gonna add two pints of fresh raspberries so it's gonna be mostly fruit with a little bit of sauce on it and I'm gonna fill those wonderful meringue shells with it it's really more fruit than it is sauce but just enough to sort of make it wet and delicious okay I'm just gonna pour it into a little bowl and then I'll have the meringues and the berries and I'll make whipped cream at Michael's house and now I need to just turn them ranks off I'm gonna leave them in the oven and they're gonna get really crisp [Music] an X for the main course going to make roasted striped bass with shrimp and mussels so delicious [Music] roasted striped bass it's a really easy thing to make and it actually looks fantastic so know what Michael's friends are like I wouldn't worry about friends of friends but I don't know they're good cooks oh I'll bet they're fun first I'm gonna make a sauce with lots of Mediterranean flavors saffron garlic tomatoes and then we're gonna bake the striped bass in the sauce so first for the sauce I need two tablespoons of olive oil add a cup of chopped onion two ounces of pancetta give it a little smoky flavor just dice it you can use bacon if you can't find pancetta but an Italian deli would have pinched at it you want to ask them slice it really thick Lee for you but a half an inch thick okay so the pancetta just goes in and we've cooked the pincette and onions together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent when the pancetta is cooked it's actually great sauce for any kind of like a thick meaty fish like swordfish or halibut but I particularly like with striped bass I can't wait to see the table Michael's doing he does amazing table settings so as an icebreaker I decided to put the girl's favorite flowers in front of their place setting and these orange tulips are for you-know-who boom the onions for the striped bass are looking good it's the beginning of the sauce pancetta and onions and now I think we need a little garlic give it a little spunk so just about a tablespoon of chopped garlic it's about three large cloves of garlic right in just cook it for a minute just until the garlic starts to cook okay now I need some Tomatoes one can of chopped tomatoes I want to drain that tomatoes I'm just gonna take them out with a slotted spoon right into the sauce just like that okay just stir them in okay give it even more flavor a little saffron very Mediterranean teaspoon teaspoon of salt please use kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper and some wine about a half cup of white wine always use a good wine that you would drink and just to give it even more flavor about a quarter cup of Pernod which is a fennel flavored look her just enough that's a real Provencal flavor so the sauce is gonna simmer for about five minutes I'm gonna get the fish ready so the first thing I need is the bass and I'm one bass fillet an incredibly large bass fillet which I want to cut in half so it'll fit in the dish just cut it right in half turn around okay that looks good just like that I have about 24 mussels that it's that have been clean put them right on top and a pound of shrimp but actually peeled and deveined but I just left the tails on because I think it looks great just like that it's pretty lit with salt and pepper I love it's a whole seafood dish and the sauce looks like it's perfect it smells wonderful can actually smell the fennel from the Perrineau and the garlic tomatoes hmm it's gonna be good okay right on the top okay I'm gonna bake at 350 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes until the fish is just cooked and the mussels are open and next I'm gonna make a delicious couscous with pine nuts to go with it I'm almost ready to go to my friend Michaels to meet some friends of his that he's got over I'm bringing dinner so I'm making striped sea bass which is done and all I have to do now is make some couscous so I'm just gonna heat some butter chopped up some shallots so it's four tablespoons of butter and about 3/4 of a cup of shallots couscous is about as easy as it gets basically make a broth that's got lots of flavor in it and just let the couscous steam in it about 3 large shallot should do it got to do it quickly before they make you cry huh okay 3/4 of a cup of chopped shallots right in cook them for a few minutes until they're translucent I actually love to do this kind of party with France where Michael's doing the table setting I'm doing the food it's really a shared effort and it's much more fun I can add 3 cups of chicken stock I really prefer especially for this homemade chicken stock but if you don't have it a can would be okay right into the shallots and

of good vanilla nothing really special this is class two degrees for two hours it's a cool oven so they get nice and crisp but not browned and I can't wait to see what Michaels doing the table is such a fabulous florist so instead of doing a flower centerpiece I decided to just do a big mass of green grapes and this way if the girls get hungry which I doubt they will they can just steal a grape which I think I'll do it hmm and then just to make the centerpiece it a little more special so it doesn't look like a big bowl of grapes I just went and picked some vines out in the garden and just tuck them around meringues are only as good as what you put in them so I'm gonna make stewed berries and some whipped cream so in order to make the stew berries I'm gonna take a half a pint of fresh blueberries have your kind of fresh raspberries third of a cup of water six tablespoons of sugar what's a quarter of a cup it's four tablespoons so I need one and a half I think I'm gonna do some orange zest because they'll give the raspberries and blueberries a little depth of flavor okay give it even more flavor a little saffron very Mediterranean teaspoon teaspoon of salt I always use kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper and some wine about a half a cup of white wine always use a good wine that you drink and just to give it even more flavor about a quarter cup of Pernod which is a fennel flavored liqueur just enough that's a real Provencal flavor so the sauce is gonna simmer for about five minutes I'm gonna get the fish ready so the first thing I need is the bass and I'm one bass fillet an incredibly large bass fillet which I want to cut in half so it'll fit in the dish let's cut it right in half turn around okay that looks good just like that I've about 24 mussels that it's that have been cleaned put them right on top and a pound of shrimp I actually peeled and deveined but I just left the tails on because I think what's great just like that sprinkle it with salt and pepper things and the berries and I'll make whipped cream at Michael's house and now I need to just turn the meringues off I'm gonna leave them in the oven and they're gonna get really crisp [Music] an X for the main course I'm gonna make roasted striped bass with shrimp and mussels so delicious [Music] roasted striped bass is a really easy thing to make and it actually looks fantastic so know what Michael's friends are like I wouldn't worry about friends of friends but I don't know they're good cooks oh I'll bet they're from first I'm gonna make a sauce with lots of Mediterranean flavors saffron garlic tomatoes and then we're gonna bake the striped bass in the sauce so first for the sauce I need 2 tablespoons of olive oil got a cup of chopped onion two ounces of pancetta give it a little smoky flavor just dice it you can use bacon if you can't find pancetta but an Italian deli would have pinched out it you want to ask them slice it really sickly for you about a half an inch thick okay so the pancetta just goes in I'm gonna cook the pinch and onions together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent it isn't we all know missed the orange juice ah did you do too but it's interesting she goes back and forth sometimes it hurts tulips thank you I love my orange tulips everybody enjoyed striped bass with shrimp and mussels and and there's couscous will you

great is this okay everybody boomerang whipped cream and stewed berries and then come straight inside so I'm making a flat disc and then I'm gonna make an edge around the outside that's it actually maybe I'm gonna start from the center and go around the outside that's even better and then just keep building up the edge so you end up with a nice shell then the good news is if you do one that you don't like and just put it right back in the bag we turn over the ends so that when you turn them back it's nice and clean right Han this is something you really don't want to do on a rainy day the meringues end up you find that everybody's had meringues that are sort of chewy it's cuz they they it was too much humidity in the air really makes a huge difference surprising but it's true but you can store them for a really long time in an airtight container so find a really nice day and you can make them in advance okay I'm gonna be covered in meringue by the time I'm done with this okay just start the circle when I fill these with whipped cream and berries at the party so they don't get soggy okay into the oven 200 degrees for two hours it's a cool oven so they get nice and crisp but not

his that he's got over I'm bringing dinner so I'm making striped sea bass which is done and all I have to do now is make some couscous so I'm just gonna heat some butter chopped up some shallots so it's four tablespoons of butter and about 3/4 of a cup of shallots couscous is about as easy as it gets basically make a broth that's got lots of flavor in it and just let the couscous steam in it

doing oh they're perfect nice and brown and toasted evenly perfect okay let's see how the couscous is doing it should be nice and fluffy absorb all the liquid it's fantastic and you just fluff it with a fork you don't want to do anything else that would compact it and he thinks we'll have fun together so I'm doing the food and Michaels hosting the party I'm making a delicious roasted sea bass with shrimp and mussels with couscous and pine nuts on the side and for dessert crisp meringue shells filled with stewed berries and whipped cream [Music] like that I made a deal that I would do dinner and he's gonna do the table setting so we each get to do exactly what we want to do so the first thing I'm making is meringues and make meringue shanty which is meringues with fresh berries and whipped cream how bad can that be so I need six egg whites just the whites okay into the mixer and turn it on and whip it up quarter to teaspoon of cream of tartar which gives them volume big pinch of salt for flavor one cup of sugar edit slowly okay those go in house B and while those with I'm gonna get the pants ready so I'm gonna make individual meringues for each person so him take a measure I'm using three and a half inch measure I'm gonna draw circles I've been supporting paper on a half sheep in and then what I'll do is I'll pipe each of the meringue disks inside the circle so I know that they're all three and a half inches so just to make sure that the meringue doesn't end up with pencil marks on it I'm turn this piece of paper over and just pipe it on the top okay let's see how the mines doing I they look great they're very high volume they're whip their firm need a little bit of vanilla half a teaspoon just to give it lots of flavor well the only thing I've put in now is a half a cup of sugar I put some sugar in the beginning but I'm gonna put this in the end it makes it much tender or meringue if you fold the last half a cup of sugar in okay half a cup of sugar just sprinkle it on I'm just gonna fold it in with a spatula it's actually surprising what a difference this makes I actually love meringues after a big dinner it's a really nice sort of light dessert I like to make them individual meringues like this we're filled with berries I like to make pavlovas their big disks filled with whipped cream and fruit or chocolate okay I'm just gonna fill a piping bag the biggest bag you have with a big star tip is great and guess what if you don't have a piping bag you can just do it with a spoon and just form those little shells but I'll show you how to do it with a piping bag Akili great it's a really messy job let's start on the edge make a circle around the edge and then come straight inside so I'm making a flat disc and then I'm gonna make an edge around the outside that's it actually maybe I'm gonna start from the center and go around the outside that's even better and then just keep building up the edge so you end up with a nice shell and the good news is if you do one that you don't like and just put it right back in the bag we turn over the ends so that when you turn them back it's nice and clean right hand this is something you really don't want to do on a rainy day the meringues end up you find that everybody's had meringues that are sort of chewy it's cuz they was too much humidity in the air really makes a huge difference surprising but it's true but you can store them for a really long time in an airtight container so find a really nice day and you can make them in advance okay I'm gonna be covered in meringue by the time I'm done with this okay just start the circle I'm going to fill these with whipped cream and berries at the party so they don't get soggy okay into the oven 200 degrees for two hours it's a cool oven so they get nice and crisp but not browned and I can't wait to see what Michaels doing with the table is such a fabulous florist so instead of doing a flower centerpiece I decided to just do a big mass of green grapes and this way if the girls get hungry which I doubt they will they can just steal a grape which I think I'll do hmmm and then just to make the centerpiece a little more special so it doesn't look like a big bowl of grapes I just went and picked some vines out in the garden and just tuck them around my eyes are only as good as what you put in them so I'm gonna make stewed berries and some whipped cream so in order to make the stew berries I'm gonna take a half a pint of fresh blueberries have your kind of fresh raspberries third of a cup of water six tablespoons of sugar what's the quarter of a pep it's four tablespoons so I need one and a half I think I'm gonna do some orange zest because they'll give the raspberries and blueberries a little depth of flavor about a quarter of a teaspoon a freshly grated orange zest I like when something has a little extra flavor sort of like an under flavor that it doesn't overpower it just to sort of hit you quietly so quarter teaspoon freshly grated orange zest I'm just gonna turn this on so this just needs to come to a boil and then I'm gonna lower the heat and cook it for about eight to ten minutes until a little syrupy and I'm gonna add some more fresh fruit I think it might need a little hit at the end to something like cognac or liqueur but that's gonna be anything on this check out the pantry lower thee bitch so I'm always looking for that one thing that like brings out the essence of a dish you don't really know it's there but it just tastes incredible so for the stew parries black currant liqueur cassis a little too bitter oh I know front woz it's raspberry liqueur and it's really gonna make the berries come alive so this looks done it's been simmering a little bit it's a little syrupy a little friend waz about two teaspoons just enough to give it a hit again just a little flavor but not to overpower it and now off the heat I'm gonna add two pints of fresh raspberries so it's gonna be mostly fruit with a little bit of sauce on it and I'm gonna fill those wonderful meringue shells with it it's really more fruit than it is sauce but just enough to sort of make it wet and delicious okay I'm just gonna pour it into a little bowl and then I'll have the meringues and the berries and I'll make whipped cream at Michael's house and now I need to just turn the meringues off I'm gonna leave them in the oven and they're gonna get really crisp [Music] and next for the main course I'm gonna make roasted striped bass with shrimp and mussels so delicious [Music] roasted striped bass it's a really easy thing to make and it actually looks fantastic so know what Michael's friends are like I wouldn't worry about friends of friends but I don't know they're good cooks oh I'll bet they're fun first I'm gonna make a sauce with lots of Mediterranean flavors saffron garlic tomatoes and then we're gonna bake the striped bass in the sauce so first for the sauce I need two tablespoons of olive oil got a cup of chopped onion 2 ounces of pancetta give it a little smoky flavor just dice it you can use bacon if you can't find pancetta but an Italian deli would have pinched out it you want to ask me to slice it really sickly for you but a half an inch thick okay so the pancetta just goes in and we've cooked the pancetta and onions together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent when it pancetta is cooked this actually great sauce for any kind of like a thick meaty fish like swordfish or halibut but I particularly like let's strike that can't wait to see the table Michael's doing he does amazing table settings so as an icebreaker I decided to put the girl's favorite flowers in front of their place setting and these orange tulips are for you-know-who mmm the onions for the striped bass are looking good the beginning of the sauce pancetta and onions and then I think we need a little garlic give it a little spunk so just about a tablespoon of chopped garlic it's about three large cloves of garlic right in just cook it for a minute just until the garlic starts to cook okay now I need some Tomatoes one can of chopped tomatoes I want to drain that tomatoes I'm just gonna take them out with a slotted spoon right into the sauce [Music] I'm just gonna cover the sea bass it looks gorgeous all the mussels have opened shrimp perfectly cooked gonna be such a good riddance okay into the cooler just fits rings on top and I'm ready to go to Michael's [Music] great that's gonna be so much fun huh look at this I've got meringues and dinner you take two you get it off I got sure yep I got it fantastic just a few things to do before the girls arrive I'm just gonna make whipped cream for the meringues and stewed berries and then everything's gonna be done so very cold heavy cream about two cups two tablespoons of sugar three spoons of good vanilla nothing really special your degrees for two hours it's a cool

roasted striped bass is a really easy thing to make and it actually looks fantastic so know what Michael's friends are like I wouldn't worry about friends of friends but I don't know they're good cooks so I'll bet they're fun first I'm gonna make a sauce with lots of Mediterranean flavors saffron garlic tomatoes and then we
[Music] sometimes the best ideas happen by chance one day my bridge friends and I were just sitting around saying we needed to have more fun so I suggested we have a potluck dinner where everybody brings a different course it all started two weeks ago [Music] you know I just have this feeling that all my friends think I live out in the Hamptons all I ever do is party but bridge is about it don't we need to have a party or something real party so what should we do no come on we got to be able to think of something I guess we could are you down then I had a great idea how about this how about if we do a potluck party and we'll all draw straws to see who makes what and I'll be the host okay everybody choose a course and that's how the cards were dealt so who got what hi I'm Jack and I can't cook a thing but the good news is I got antipasto for the potluck dinner and as ina says if you can't cook you buy it and assemble it and that's what I'm gonna do hi I'm mark and I'm gonna be doing dessert that's what I chose I think what I'll do is I'm his peach and raspberry Chris she made it for me quite a while ago and I've been cooking it ever since it's delicious and it's very easy to do I'm Patti I've got the wine and it's a great excuse to try a few bottles and me I'm making the main course and since it was all my idea I get to be the host - I can't wait to see what everybody else is bringing I thought it'd make vegetable pot pie and since the party's tonight I better get started so a lot of parts to this recipe but the first one is I'm gonna make the sauce and what I've done is I've put one and a half sticks of butter in a pot I know it looks like a lot of butter and it makes lots of vegetable pot pies I'm just gonna chop up these onions actually I think I'm gonna just slice them we use some unusual ingredients in this recipe we use fennel which has sort of Anna nice flavour and saffron which gives a great spice they're sort of Provence all flavors so the next thing is fennel which is actually a licorice flavored vegetable it's very sharp when it's fresh you can eat it fresh but I like it much better cooked it has a very delicate flavor and when it's cooked in butter and it's it's just so delicate and flavorful I love it so one head of fennel should do it so that's gonna cook for about ten minutes until the onions are translucent and the fennel has a really sweet flavor so the vegetable pot pie has all different kinds of vegetables in it and the first one is potatoes which are cut up in a dice and I've been cooking for about 10 minutes has a lot of vegetables most of them I'm just gonna blanch for a few minutes so they get some liquid in them before I actually bake the potpie so I've got carrots but one and a half cups butternut squash and he was blanch them all together just fine and then asparagus tips about one and a half cups right into the pot of boiling water so these vegetables are gonna blanch for about five minutes and they all cook together which is great and then time I can smell the onions and fennel are done okay and now I'm gonna make this sauce so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of flour we're just gonna thicken the sauce and then it's gonna cook for about two minutes you get rid of that sort of raw flour taste okay it's time to take the vegetables out I just think they needs a little bit of moisture that you get when they blanch before they go into the pot pie tastes so much better it's something really good in the pot pie and any goes chicken stock and of course if you want to make this vegetarian you can always use vegetable stock that's gonna start to thicken really quickly but a few more ingredients to add this is Pernod what you buy in the liquor store and it's actually got a fennel flavor and I think it just mmm love the way it smells just gonna add about a tablespoon to enhance the fennel flavor in this might have been a little more than a tablespoon it'll be good and then saffron saffron is actually the stamens of crocuses can you imagine collecting those it's why it's so expensive and a big pinch of it really adds an enormous flavor and spice to this epic teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper a lot of this depends on how salty or peppery your chicken stock is so you want to taste it and look how thick and gorgeous this sauce is now I wonder what my friends are up to what kind of trouble they're getting into hey Brian Jack how are you good I need a nice platter of antipasto sure and I think I'll start with 4 artichokes but Hank maybe some octopus salad all right and is there any type of cheese that you make here that's sort of impressive or oh well we make the fresh mozzarella every day okay so I definitely want one of those I'll put that in the water for you I'll stay fresh that way okay so here we go and I think that's it all right we wrap yeah perfect to paraphrase Gloria Vanderbilt the sauce can never be too rich or too delicious so I'm gonna add a little bit of heavy cream but you really don't have to just makes it taste all that much better like three tablespoons it just gives it a smoothness that's wonderful and now the vegetables so I've got all these blanch vegetables I'm just going to put them right in those that looked great I love the colors and the textures flavors it's gonna be good okay and then my little secret frozen small whole onions nobody needs to peel all these onions and you can throw them in frozen because I'm gonna defrost in the sauce and the last thing is for parsley and the sauce is done and the next thing I want to do is make the case Brook for the really important things about making pastry like the one I'm gonna make for the vegetable pot pie it's really cold ingredients like ice water and very cold butter and the other thing is to make sure the ingredients like the butter isn't chopped up too fun I'll show you how to do it I think a lot of people find pastry really don't think once you get the hang of the principles it's not so hard okay first thing is flour and I make pastry and a food processor it's really fast three cups of flour I use all-purpose flour 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of salt 1 teaspoon of baking powder you want to make sure it's fresh you know what baking powder it's been sitting in your pantry for two years okay and then I'm gonna add butter okay what butter it's nice and cold really big chunks okay right into it food processor 1/2 a cup of vegetable shortening I actually like to combine the flavor of butter with the flakiness that vegetable shortening gives right into the food processor so this is the next important step in addition to cold ingredients is I'm going to process this in the food processor but I want bits of butter all through the dough I don't want it pureed maybe ten pulses and then I'm just gonna check it and you want the butter like the size of peas so that's perfect just all through it and now I'm gonna put the ice water in about two-thirds of a cup with the motor running just pour it in just until it forms a ball of dough perfect so I'm gonna flour the board this is stone so I can do it directly on the stone you can use a wooden board anything like that it's gonna dump the dough right on top carefully take out the blade I've been known to cut myself we roll this in a ball this is just great it's soft it's got a nice feeling about it and I can see little bits of butter throughout the dough so I know I've done it right okay that's perfect the wrap in plastic wrap I'm gonna refrigerate it for about 30 minutes and that allows the gluten in the flour to relax it makes a really flaky pastry hey I'm going to a potluck party tonight and I don't know what they're serving could be fish could be meat can you help me find something I've got just a knife great thanks so educators of California Pinot Grigio okay it's gonna be light crisp very intense in flavor clothes s it's gonna go well with pasta salads okay do they make a good read as well they also make a nice Cabernet goes very well with things like if I don't barbecue very light very smooth great why don't it take one light and one red and party all happen by [Music] and finally we get to make vegetable pot pies I'm gonna make individual ones I think they'll be really nice so I'm gonna fill each bowl with a filling all the vegetables and sauce with fennel and pear no okay now I'm going to cover each one with pastry so this is the pastry than it chilled for about 30 minutes so it's firm enough and it has time for the gluten to relax it's perfect don't be nervous about having too much flour on the board just you want to be sure the pastry is always moving more like having flour all over me I'm gonna roll it out big enough so that I can cut out for large rounds to go on top of these balls they always want to roll from the center to the outside and you can see little bits of butter throughout the dough so I know it's gonna be really flaky so I'm gonna get another bowl and use it as a template to cut out the circles so upside-down Bowl we wanted about an inch bigger than the actual bowl so you can fold it over the edge of the bowl okay now I'm gonna use egg wash it's actually just an egg beaten with water or cream or milk whatever you have around but a tablespoon it's gonna become like a little bit of a glue and then the pastry top goes on top just like that so I'm just gonna press this to the edge make sure it stays so all the filling stays inside before you put these in the oven be sure you have oven proof dishes okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to brush the top with egg wash just because that'll make it nice and brown when it comes out of the oven the pastry will be gorgeous and then I think it looks great to have salt and pepper on the top so I'm gonna just put a little bit of salt on each one did that look like it has lots of flavor and then some pepper want to do it after the egg wash so it sticks and then with my knife I'm just gonna cut a few slits in the top of each one so some of the steam escapes you don't want these things exploding in the oven okay 375 degrees for an hour and I'm gonna have absolutely delicious vegetable pot pies for my friends so Jack hinted that he was bringing onto posture I thought I'd surprise them and do roasted red peppers to add to it these red peppers are really sweet I find green peppers a little bitter I really want to get the core and those little white ribs out okay olive oil salt and pepper it's gonna drizzle it on this is the messy job I just want to drizzle each one with olive oil just she would sit around lots of salt and pepper really important okay I'm gonna roast them at 500 degrees which is really hot for about 20 minutes and then I'll show you how to take the skins off and later I'm gonna do them in basil oil it'd be really good inés recipe for peach raspberry crisp is so easy I know it by heart all I do is blanch the peaches add some orange zest a little granulated sugar some brown sugar and some flour tossing the raspberries I know everybody's gonna enjoy it pour it into an oval baking dish and let it sit for about five minutes just all the flavors sort of come together and then we'll add the topping later this pepper smell ready and they are cut gorgeous they are they're all sort of blackened and charred on the outside and they're gonna be really sweet on the inside this is the trick for peeling them really easily I put them in a big bowl and I'm gonna cover them with plastic wrap and let them sit for about 10 minutes [Music] the plastic graph is gonna keep the steam in and it's the steam that's gonna make it really easy to get the skins off so I understand Mart's making an old favorite I wonder what he's up to okay the fruits ready and now it's time for the crisp part of the recipe got flour [Music] some brown sugar some granulated sugar oatmeal a little bit of salt the butter which has been diced and it's nice and cold what we're gonna do is turn on the mixer low and just let it all mix up in the chill it becomes sort of pea-sized we're getting that okay this is done now all you do is put the topping on you gotta lay it on nice and thick because when it cooks it gets nice and bubbly and it so good it goes into the oven for an hour until the top is crispy and juices are bubbling always looking for new ways to give things flavor so I thought it'd be great on the red peppers to make like a basil oil watch how easy this is it's like a big handful of basil leaves and clove of garlic so we've got the flavors of pesto but much lighter much more like an oil you can use it in salad dressings just really wonderful to have around garlic I'm just gonna puree until the garlic is really chopped up fine and now I'm just going to pour oil and while it's go that smells great salt pepper and then just a taste to be sure it's really good it smells good Spray that's gonna be really good on the red peppers so I promise to be really easy to take the skins off these roasted peppers we'll see they've been steaming away and just all you have to do is just peel the skin off it's incredibly easy see it works and you didn't believe me later on I'm going to slice them and then drizzle them with basil oil so those are already [Music] [Music] perfect that's a great antipasto okay if it's a pretty delicious look for the base of all it just throws it on top like this so people know it's basil oil I would like to put a big bunch of basil right on the plate [Music] [Music] let's just put it right down on the table take your usual bridge seats Jax and Acosta looks fabulous it's a work of architecture work and I have roasted peppers of anybody nice Sauvignon with them we should test our poster oh thank you thank what a great idea who wants vegetable pot pie so it's got potatoes and butternut squash carrots asparagus and little onions I'll tell you the secret of a flaky crust I'm listening oh you're really cold ingredients and Mark made my favorite peach raspberry crisp I can't believe you know it was my favorite I love it marks the creator the first one great wine choose [Music]
[Music] my friend did weena is coming for dinner tonight well she's not just any friend she's my incredibly talented friend who designed my garden and I thought after a chilly stroll through the orchard it'd be really wonderful to have a warm dinner by the fireplace just us girls [Music] it's that time of year when there's a little snap in the air and I'd love to make a really cozy dinner by the fire so I thought I'd make in Wien a roast loin of pork with roasted vegetables and maybe for dessert rum raisin rice pudding I actually use those big Spanish onions there's so much easier to slice and dice okay and next I think I'm going to do some potatoes I'd love to use these Yukon Gold potatoes you'll see the inside they're just this gorgeous yellow color and I just find them the flavor sort of buttery and really great but you can use red new potatoes or you can use white ones whatever you can find just like that so easy I've got a whole bunch right here and I've been cutting they go right on top of the onion some of them missed the pan I love this just because it's really one pot meal all the vegetables are in the bottom the earth loin of pork on the top they cook together it's not bad so the next thing I think I'm gonna do is carrots when carrots cook they really cook down they get smaller so just be sure you use really big chunks okay into the pan with the carrots I can really use any vegetables you like to roast but I think these are really delicious and colorful together and now for my favorite vegetable the fennel this is what fennel looks like when it's in the bulb sometimes it has big tops on it but you usually buy it like this and you can really find in the grocery store pretty frequently now I want to cut the top off like that these are really sort of tough so you don't want to eat them but interesting thing is when it's raw it has a very strong anise flavor which is good but I'm not that crazy about it but when it's cooked it's sweet and delicious and believe me it's wonderful and then just slice the whole thing in half you'll see there's a core here which is just fine to eat so I'm just gonna cut right through the core it will keep the fennel together when it roasts just cut it in big wedges just like that you can really do all of this chopping either early in the day or even the day before and just keep it wrapped in the refrigerator and then you can just roast the whole thing together the next day so sandal goes into the pan looks like a lot of vegetables so it's gonna cook down a little bit okay everything's in the pan together and now I'm just gonna season it a little bit of butter a little bit of olive oil lots of salt you'd be surprised how much you need for a big pot of vegetables like this lots of freshly ground black pepper ready and then clean hands just toss them all together you can really smell the liquors in the fennel so what I'm going to do is later I'm gonna roast it and then I'm gonna put a loin of pork on top to cook with it I'm really good but first I need some fresh thyme for my garden [Music] there are lots of different kinds of time like lemon time but I'm a traditionalist I like the old-fashioned English time I put it in Jeffrey's rose checking every Friday night but today I'm gonna use it with mustard and garlic for a loin of pork it's really really good got a really beautiful loin of pork from the butcher you know it used to be that pork was sort of dry it had to cook it forever and I think it had no flavor I didn't actually eat it when I was growing up so I've been experimenting with it and it turns out it's really flavorful and moist and I think it's changed dramatically over the past 10 years so I really recommend it when I asked the butcher to prepare this I asked him to leave a little bit of fat on the top so it keeps the meat really nice and moist so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a marinade that's gonna go on the top of the pork and it's all the flavors are gonna get into it it'll sit for a little while while I worse the vegetables it's gonna be really moist and delicious so two cloves of garlic just smash it and you take the peel off really easily just like that lose chop it up grab your phone okay man I need tablespoon of salt tablespoon of fresh thyme so this takes a little time but time takes time but it's really worth it so what you do is just run your fingers backwards along the stem and those little leaves really come off I made a better table in the fresh thyme okay into the food processor and I'm just going to mix it all up so much easier than all that chopping and the last thing I need is a quarter of a cup of mustard good Dijon mustard mix it all up and that's it for a marinade so I'm just gonna rub it on the outside of the pork my friend on a pump who owns loaves and fish isn't right - wonderful cookbooks does this a lot with pork and beef and things like that it's really like a rub that you put on top and let it just soak in so I learned that from her okay so I'm just gonna put this aside for about 30 minutes and let this gorgeous marinade get into the meat and in the meantime I'm gonna roast the vegetables so the vegetables rose at 425 which is pretty high temperature about 30 minutes and then I'm going to take the pork and put it on top and cook them all together it's gonna be really good I'm making a fireside dinner for my friend Audrina and me and when he's very special because she designed my garden and I thought what would be cozier on a chilly night than having rum raisin rice pudding for dessert so that's what I'm making so the first thing for rice pudding is you need rice and I've cooked about 3/4 of a cup of basmati rice I actually love to use basmati rice it's sort of got a nuttier flavor and it's like a whole grain rice so it's wonderful and rice pudding so that's cooked for about 8 or 9 minutes with a little bit of salt and now I'm gonna add 4 cups of half-and-half if you want to be good you can use milk but I want this to be delicious I'm gonna turn up the heat and then have a cup of sugar and just let that cook for about 25 minutes I'm gonna bring up the heat until it boils and then lower it and let it simmer for about 25 minutes until the rice is perfectly cooked and then I'm gonna add all these great flavors like rum raisin so I'm gonna take about 3/4 of a cup of raisins and 2 tablespoons of really good rum I love good dark room it's got such great flavor just pour it over I'm just gonna mix them up a little bit so the raisins soaked in all that rum these are just gonna sit here and get better and better wonderful so I'm just gonna turn this down to simmer and let it cook for 25 minutes can you tell I love to out yes and I thought since it weaned is coming for dinner I do something from the garden at the table so these white dahlias would be great you know the thing about flowers is it looks like a white Dahlia but if we really look in the center of it that lime green is such a great color on the table and when I'm doing an arrangement let's try and do it the wave grows so one of the buds in there is really nice gonna do something on the table some on the fireplace [Music] values are great because that is huge long stance and you can make an enormous arrangements out of them but for a small intimate table I just think it's nice that the proportion is really small and tight so I'm gonna cut the stems really short that's why do the centerpiece the flowers and the candles particularly the light from the candles is to focus your attention inward so if you have a nice small table for two people it just makes it much more intimate candle sort of represents the hearth or the fireplace that's the fireside dinner it's particularly appropriate [Music] I'd be nice and warm and cozy for dinner [Music] well I think the rice is ready looks just gorgeous creamy but I just want to make sure the rice grains are done this is not the place for al dente no that's great it's creamy and wonderful so I'm gonna add one more cup of half-and-half I know it sounds like a lotta half and a half but most rice pudding is actually made with milk and then you had heavy cream at the end so I thought why not just make it easier and make it all half and a half just stir that in so now I'm just gonna add an egg to thicken it mmm good and messy I'm just gonna add one egg and just stir it in slowly I'm just gonna give the rice pudding a really good texture okay and while that's cooking for a minute I'm gonna add one and a half teaspoons of vanilla I love the smell of that and the rum and raisins that I've really been soaking for about a half hour mmm they're so good and then just put it right in turn off the heat yikes stir it up mmm this looks so good I love when the rum hits the heat and you just get that whiff of rum it's sort of like rum raisin ice cream so I'm just gonna put it in a bowl and chill it and then it'll be ready for dessert and it's gonna be wonderful in front of the fire the loin of pork and sautéed cabbage I'm just gonna put a little bit of film right over the top so it doesn't form a skin and I think that's gonna be really nice dessert on a chilly winter night in front of the fireplace so that vegetables are about half done I'm gonna put the pork right on top they smell so good all the fennel and carrots and potatoes it's really starting to get brown you oh this smells so good Wow who even gets that pork with it yeah I'm gonna take this whole loin of pork I'll just put it right on top just like that and they're all gonna cook together so it's gonna cook at the same temperature 425 for about 30 minutes if the one of pork is this size sometimes they're much bigger something might take about 50 minutes but for this one it's 30 minutes at 425 until the loin of pork is exactly 138 degrees in the middle and it will be perfect now I can't wait for it winter to come for dinner hey Charlie just a moment I'm going over to Ines house for dinner tonight and we're gonna get her a plant [Music] oh these echinacea czar tempting but it's an orange and purple garden must stick to the color scheme this is great perfect padeen blooms in the fall just the right color I'll take this [Music] come on Charlie now it's time for you to go home get changed just a few things left to do for dinner that's so good so the loin of pork is cooked and the vegetables look fabulous so this is a secret to really good meat take it out of the oven and let it rest for about 20 minutes and it'll get really moist and juicy and delicious it just reabsorbs all those juices you surprised what a big difference it makes and then these vegetables the fennel and the carrots and onions and potatoes that all absorb all the juices not just from the pork but also from each other and back in the oven for another 20 minutes so they get even ground or they stay nice and hot for the pork Edwina what fabulous thing of your breath besides yourself lespedeza I like the name of it half-bad I can't wait to show you the garden it looks incredible and you taught me about things like our geranium such a silly little flower just grouped in a huge mass it's one it's just great yeah if we put it behind the fence it will come through oh and support it yeah it's just wonderful good and weena brings the best gifts I can't wait to see what this is oh they're garden gloves and they're off the lane that's wonderful but the idea that you don't lose you can see them from my mile away right but they look wonderful with my and are you in charge of planting plants I like that so with the one of porking roasted vegetables that it'll be really nice to have sautéed cabbage I know it's a really odd vegetable but it's really good I think we're used to having cabbage like it's coleslaw or boiled cabbage or just forget I don't like it all but when you saute it with a little butter and salt and pepper it's so good it gets really sweet and tender and you'd really be surprised and I happen to know why do we know was it so I'm gonna cut up this cabbage I'm gonna keep your hands out of the way find the smallest cabbage you possibly can and don't throw away the green leaves I love the way they look when you saute them and just shred it the way to shred coleslaw just long thin shreds just like that was design I know this looks like a lot of cabbage but it's kind of like spinach it cooks down to very little okay I'm going to show you what to do with the green leaves it's so much easier to do it this way roll them up like that and then this is called chiffonade or Juliette okay so ready to cook [Music] okay lots of salt and pepper so that's great that's gonna cook for about 15 minutes well I slice the lunar pork and get the vegetables out [Music] so good so I'll have to just get the cabbage ready and dinner sir [Music] so I put salt in the recipe I just think it makes such a difference to have a little bit of salt on the top and a great finishing salt is sea salt I actually have French fleur de sel but doesn't have to be that fancy just on the top you'd be surprised what a difference it makes and dinner's ready and I think it Wayne is on the way in from the garden hello hi Edwina hi isn't the light gorgeous in the garden when the Sun Goes Down oh it's just fabulous I got the plant in the ground oh great are you ready for dinner oh yeah I have loin of pork with roast vegetables and sautéed cabbage because I know you love it so will you take the flowers and put in the back and I think there might be a nice chill bottle of white wine for us oh that's perfect you want to pour and I'll serve and some sautéed cabbage absolutely oh it's beautiful I doing it to you and my gorgeous going thank you you're welcome it's such a mean it's just as such a total pleasure I hope you enjoy dinner and for the grand finale Oh raisin rice pudding Wow it's like rum raisin ice cream but it's rice pudding oh good sounds good little fireside dinner a little loin of pork a little rice pudding it's cozy and good friendship and good friendship that's what it's all about [Music]
I think just about every one of us has dreamed one time or another about owning a business well my friend Ina Garten turned her dream into a reality when she left her job in Washington DC in 1978 exactly and she opened a specialty food shop called the Barefoot Contessa how many of us always want to have a restaurant or a food store right I think a lot of people dream of it so you may area of the Barefoot Contessa she now has 50 employees a best-selling cookbook athle named the Barefoot Contessa cookbook and legions of devoted customers I do then how are you we spent some time with her any Hampton New York to learn the secret of her success I think a name really is important when you're getting started I actually inherited the name Barefoot Contessa and I think it's perfect because it comes from a movie with Hebert Gardner and Humphrey Bogart and what it's about is about being elegant and mercy and I think that's what we are the Barefoot Contessa is a 3,000 square foot Emporium of epicurean excellence delighting both the eye and the palate but this piece for the senses was created not by a gourmand but by a desk-bound bureaucrat who wanted to change when I was in my 20s and I was trying to figure out what to do with my life I was working in a group in the White House called office of management and budget working on nuclear energy policy what was I doing there so I decided that it was time to look for something new and I saw an ad for a business for sale in The New York Times there was a specialty food store in a town I'd never been in before and I thought I don't want to go investigate this starting your own business is a challenging and harrowing experience but choosing what to do according to ina is easy what a friend had told me is when you're thinking about what you want to do with your life think about what you used to do when you were 10 when you did things naturally with that thing about what should I be doing should I be a lawyer should I be a doctor what did you really enjoy doing and what I loved to do was cook so I went up to the town in the Hamptons to investigate this specialty food store and I thought this is excessive what I want to do so I made her a very low offer thinking well look home I'll think about it we'll negotiate and I went back to Washington and the next day she called me in my office and said thank you very much I accept your offer and I went oh my god what have I done the first thing she did was to negotiate a sensible financial arrangement we structured the deal so that first of all I could pay half of its money up front and then half of it out of the proceeds of the business so that I wasn't burdened with an enormous amount of expenses up front second she arranged to have the owner briefly stay on she stayed with me for months to teach me what I needed to know I didn't know how to hire somebody I knew how to make brownies for 12 people but I had no idea how to make 5,000 brownies and that's what I needed she know how to do you want to sit down right here five minutes register she'll take care of you there and the second day I was overwhelmed I had no idea what I was getting into I took over the store on Thursday before Memorial Day weekend and I thought at the end of the day the woman who sold me the store was telling me how to cash out the register we had eighty-five dollars in the drawer and I thought I'll never make it here and that next day having no idea what the Hansons was like Friday is Memorial Day weekend we were overrun I closed the store at 10 o'clock at night and everything in the store was gone it wasn't a cupcake that wasn't a salad there wasn't a brownie there wasn't a piece of cheese and we looked at each other and horror and I thought this is going to be the worst experience of my life now when I first met Larry he actually came to me and said he wanted to come work here and I said what do you like to make and he said cookies and I said you're hired and boy was I right so you make lie turned out to be ammonia's rewarding experiences of her life and it made her determined to learn every aspect of the business how's it going it was really important for me to know everybody's job so the first six months when I took over the store I decided I would not change anything I would just work with each person in the store and figure out exactly what they do so I knew I could do that job that's important for me for several reasons one if somebody's sick I can take over their job and second I think it commands more respective if I know how to do their job at least as well as they do and then as I built the business I knew how to train somebody because I had already done that job as the bread Rises instead of cracking in random places it will rise incidence catering was virgin territory to einen and in those early days elbow grease innovation and mom prevented a disaster we talked about the menu this was 20 years ago and I said well how about if we do a poached salmon and she said perfect and I thought poached salmon I've never made a poached salmon in my life so I got on the phone mom how do you poach a salmon so my mother talked to me about how to poach a salmon in the oven and I took it to this woman's house to do the salmon where you roll it up in foil and you put the court bullion in and you put the whole thing in the oven and I got there and realized the oven was too small for the Sam and I thought oh my god what am I going to do so I cut the head off I cut the tail off I put them all in pieces I put them in the oven and then we took it out and I reconstructed that salmon so nobody ever knew I had to cut it up it was fine and it was delicious creative solutions like these helps her become an expert in her field if I didn't know how to make what it is that I needed to be solved I'd go home by myself and I'd spend a week making scones and at the end of the process I know more about scones and anybody who worked for me and then I would bring them the recipes and say I think it'd be really interesting to make scones this way let's try it and that's how I really got knowledgeable about doing it and I'm not going to learn that in busy school I had to learn it by doing it myself [Music]
so the first thing I want to make my working lunch it's chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting so I need one and a half sticks is 12 tablespoons of unsalted butter at room temperature and then I use two kinds of sugar brown sugar because it has a little bit of a molasses flavor I need 2/3 of a cup like that and I hope to use granulated sugar because it makes it lighter and a cream moves together okay two eggs extra large eggs and you want them at room temperature that way they mix in that just until they gets completely incorporated two teaspoons of vanilla okay now for some wet ingredients I need a cup of buttermilk actually I would like to shake it a little because sometimes separates this is really good for baking it's actually low-fat there I say it's half a cup of sour cream it actually makes the batter really thick and keeps the cake very moist and two tablespoons of coffee you don't really notice the coffee share but it really makes the chocolate taste delicious just stir that together going to combine this until smooth okay after the dry ingredients once recorded cups of flour I use unbleached all-purpose flour one cup of cocoa powder this is what gives it all that chocolate flavor and now you see why I sift everything because the cocoa powder has lumps in it one and a half teaspoons of baking soda and half a teaspoon of salt myself is really surprisingly important when you're baking really brings out the coffee and the chocolate and the peanut butter flavor okay just sift those all together I'm mostly going to add the dry ingredients now for some wet ingredients smells amazing really chocolatey and then just finish it up with a spatula to make sure it's really well mixed okay into the muffin cups okay into the oven 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes and then I'm going to work on the icing mmm so I need one cup of confectioner's sugar one cup of peanut butter smooth or creamy okay five tablespoons of unsalted butter at room temperature it's really important so it blends in really well it's going to start mixing that on low speed so you don't have confectioner sugar everywhere three-quarters of a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and lashing is 1/3 of a cup of cream to make it nice and creamy just want to mix it I don't want to with it because I want to do like a fluffy ones have great flavor okay that's it that's the frosting and the last one [Music] and then when I sprinkle it with chopped peanuts because make it even better it's actually wonderful because it gives it texture but you also know that it's subpoena from the peanuts on time
[Music] chicken salad Veronique it's like chicken salad but elevated to party food I thought Michael and Jim would really like it so the first thing I did was I roasted chicken breasts olive oil salt and pepper for 35 minutes at 350 degrees and it really makes the chicken so much moisture than poaching it let it cool a little bit take the skin off I'm just going to cube this kind of one or two small but I want sort of bite-sized pieces imperfect I'm going to just right into the bowl chicken still a little warm which is a great way to make the salad and then it really absorbs the flavor once it's cold it's firmer and it doesn't absorb the flavor so much so chicken salad Veronique I think comes from probably so Veronique which is classically made with grapes chicken there's so much more flavor when it's roasted than it does when it's poached there's something about the water that just takes all the flavor out of it and there's so many about the olive oil salt and pepper that gives it flavor so I think for tonight I'm going to do four chicken breasts okay now for the sauce so first have a cup of mayonnaise put it right into the bowl and toss it all together okay now some green things so first our gun which is a really delicate herb when I have tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves this really is a place for fresh herbs just going to chop it up it smells wonderful I think you've really under used herb tarragon okay the next thing is celery in the category of lots of green things I'm going to run my knife right down the middle leave it attached on the top and just shut up okay right in shelter two stalks of celery it's about one cup of celery [Music] but the good news is you can do as much as you like okay that should be just about one cup and now comes the veronique part green grapes so I need about one cup of green grapes cut in half or make sure use in this grapes nobody wants to be crunching their chickens oh and the salads it farewell to because all the flavors the tarragon will really get into the chicken and the sweetness of the grapes okay that's it for the grade a little salt and pepper just where and a half teaspoons of salt and it sounds odd to have salt and grapes together but really brings out the flavor of them one teaspoon pepper toss it all together and that's chicken salad any
[Music] I live in East Hampton New York and one of the local treasures is the symptom Historical Society they oversee five separate museums some of which take back to 1640 which in the United States is really old by friends Frank no bald Valerie Smith and I decided to do a lunch to celebrate the staff and volunteers I hope they love it so I'm grilling some swordfish which is going to be served with a very flavorful tomato caper basil sauce plus zucchini couscous that's flavored with saffron and cumin and for dessert double trouble chocolate pudding with two kinds of chocolate to make the ultimate comfort food really special so while I do the cooking Frank and Valerie is setting the table in one of the historic barns that date back to 1640 right at the end of my street [Music] I love old-fashioned comfort food I mean who doesn't and I thought it'd be really nice for the folks of the Historical Society if I made an old-fashioned comfort dessert so I'm gonna make chocolate pudding I'm gonna start with six egg yolks right into the mixer make sure you get all the good ingredients in half a cup of sugar and I'm gonna beat this until it's really thick and pale yellow and a ribbon falls back on itself I'll show you what it looks like in the meantime and then heat some milk two cups of whole milk what I'm gonna do it's like making a custard I'm gonna heat the milk pour it into the egg mixture and then pour it back in stir it for a little while until it's really nice and thick so we're there and you'll see there's a long ribbon that falls right back on itself so now I'm gonna add some more things cornstarch to make it nice and thick I need a quarter of a cup of cornstarch three tablespoons of ground sweet chocolate he's really good chocolate because that's a huge difference and then I'm gonna add more chocolate later and a pinch of salt because even baked goods need salt and just mix those together on low speed in a cloud of chocolate and then you check and see if the milks ready and it's perfect and I'm gonna pour it very slowly into this mixture just like making a custard [Music] now I'm gonna pour the chocolate mixture back into the pan and just cook it for a few minutes and it gets really thick right back in looks pretty chocolatey already but it's gonna get even more when I melt chocolate into it so I'm gonna cook it and I'm gonna add chocolate and vanilla okay there are low heat it's one of those things that you really just have to keep stirring if you leave it you know you'll have chocolate scrambled eggs move I 5 people coming for lunch their staff and volunteers and they do an incredible job keeping East Hampton historically beautiful place so I just thought it'd be nice thing to do my dear friend Frank new bald has volunteered to organize his full thing and to open this door at Mulford barn for us to and my friend Valerie has agreed to raid her store and do a gorgeous table setting as she always does the farmer who built it was so proud of his barn he put the date in it 1721 carved right in the name Frank Valerie and I are great team I'm sure it's gonna be a great party okay just as this starts to come together it starts to come together a little too much so you just switch to a whisk and just whisk it and turn the heat off and you see it's really nice and thick and gorgeous but it still needs more flavor so I'm gonna add a few other things more chocolate it's like bittersweet chocolate just about 1 ounce I'm just going to chop it up and it'll just melt into the chocolate pudding 1 ounce of chocolate 2 tablespoons of butter unsalted butter right and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of good vanilla just a dash of heavy cream 2 tablespoons you can't have dessert with that a little bit of richness and just stir those in see that wasn't much more effort than making instant pudding mix wasn't and believe me it tastes so much better now all I have to do is put it in dishes this can go into any kind of dish because I'm not baking it but these little ramekins are perfect and I'm going to pour the mixture into a measuring cup because it's so much easier to pour into ramekins from that does that look like good thick chocolate pudding oh my god this makes exactly six we need five for the lunch mmm I wonder what's going to happen in the sixth I'm just gonna cover the top with plastic wrap and let this chill I'm gonna most delicious chocolate pudding for dessert next I'm gonna make zucchini couscous it's gonna be really good [Music] so the next thing I'll make for the lunch is zucchini couscous for two reasons one it's the easiest thing in the world to make and the second is it's best eaten at room temperature so it'll be perfect for the party in the barn so first I make a flavored broth with chicken stock that's gonna flavor the couscous one and a half cups with good chicken stock if you have homemade chicken stock it really makes a difference but it's not good canned chicken stock from the grocery store is fine and then I'm gonna flavor it with one teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper quarter of a teaspoon of cumin sort of Moroccan spices since couscous is most usually associated with Morocco it's half a teaspoon of saffron which I adore it's these red filaments it's incredibly expensive but it's really worth it a little bit goes a long way and what they are as stamens of crocuses particular kind of crocus it's very spicy and sweet at the same time and then two tablespoons of butter it sure will make like making pasta and a little bit of butter to make it stick and have lots of flavor I'm just gonna heat this right up sometimes couscous is a main course usually with lamb lots of vegetables but today I'm gonna make it as a side dish with zucchini it's gonna be wonderful with a swordfish mmm it's just boiling now so I'm gonna turn off the heat and just let it steep for about 15 minutes you can smell the chicken stock and cumin and the spicy saffron it's gonna be really good winter have Valerie and Frank are doing [Music] so I better get going setting up for our lunch today I'm just gonna saute some zucchini so two zucchini good news about zucchini is you can get it all year round and it's just delicious just tap it up roughly in the summer I like to use tomatoes and zucchini and the winter I use roasted butternut squash whatever's good so just dice the zucchini roughly and sometimes even leftover vegetables are great for this so I want to heat up a few tablespoons of olive oil I just want the zucchini cooked remember it's not gonna cook once it's in this couscous all its gonna do is steep in the stock until it's a little browned on the outside and cook through and one more zucchini this is salted a little bit this is definitely the category if you salt it as you go along it takes perfectly seasoned if you salted at the end it just tastes salty just cook it for about five minutes until it's sort of browned on the outside and it's fully cooked inside so it's tender zucchini kind of has a chocolate flavor but it's not cooked not good put right on top of the couscous with a stock over it mmm look how gorgeous that stock looks you can really see the saffron and smell boom and I'm just mix it all together and you'll see I'm gonna cover it with plastic wrap and it's gonna get puffed and gorgeous and I'll be ready whenever I want to serve it it's gonna steep for about 15 minutes and meanwhile when we chop up some fresh herbs the zucchini and basil look great together so I very often use them so just some fresh basil II just take them right off the stem yeah that's Mel's good okay just shut these guys up make sure the leaves are really dry so they don't turn brown and then fresh parsley no parsley is definitely an underrated herb very often it's used as a garnish I can't figure out why but it's really delicious and so just take your knife and run along the stems we're gonna put a lot in at a really season it's very peppery I find flat leaf parsley a little more flavor than curly parsley so when I'm using it as an ingredient I try and find flat leaf but if all you have is curly it's just fine okay now into the couscous so the steamed couscous all the liquids been absorbed all the flavours gotten into it I'm just gonna add all this parsley and basil mr. the trick with couscous you want to fluff it with a fork it's amazing how it pops up and it makes a lot of couscous zucchini couscous is gonna be so good with the swordfish with tomatoes and capers and I'm gonna make next next thing I want to make for the Historical Society it's actually one of my longest standing dishes it's swordfish with tomatoes and basil and capers the first thing I'm going to do is make the sauce a lot of the reasons why this is a great dish that used to do it for catering all the time it's because you can make the sauce in advance and just grill the swordfish and then the whole thing served at room temperature so whenever you're ready to serve dinner it's ready in this case lunch so the first thing I do is a few tablespoons of olive oil about a cup of chopped fennel and about a cup of chopped onion yellow onion fennel actually had sort of an anise flavor but it gets very sweet when it's cooked and I like it that way ok so about a teaspoon of chopped garlic I always put the garlic in last cuz you don't want it to burn and just stir it around and cook it for about 10 minutes maybe a little more oil you can always add a little bit of water if it's starting to burn medium low heat and just let that get really sweet and caramelized in the meantime I'm gonna work on the tomatoes so you can use fresh tomatoes but it's so easy to use canned tomatoes if you find a good quality one they're really delicious they plump tomatoes and they're already peeled already which is really a benefit and I'm just going to drain them a little bit okay that's done some soup for this is with the sauteed onions and fennel teaspoon of salt three quarters the teaspoon of pepper and just stir it all together so this is just gonna simmer for about 15 minutes and later I'm gonna add some wine and some stock and make a gorgeous sauce out of it I know salary has great style I'm sure she's doing something gorgeous for the tables in the barn little more flavor for the sauce the swordfish and tomatoes and capers can add a little bit of wine about two tablespoons two tablespoons of chicken stock and just turn up the heat and just let the liquid reduce a little bit maybe about ten minutes and then when that's done I'm gonna add a little bit of butter capers and basil he'll have gorgeous sauce the grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers [Music] there we go I just hope this all lives up to the wonders of - food the last three things I want to add to this sauce for the swordfish our capers fresh basil and a little bit of butter first thing to do is drain the capers capers are a great flavor of tomatoes sauce can just be too sweet because the tomatoes are sweet you want a little something vinegary so two tablespoons of capers right into the sauce about a 1/2 a cup of chopped basil you need to chop it or julienne it which is long thin strips I think maybe optimally in it but a lot of flavors going on in this sauce tomatoes fennel onions garlic capers fresh basil so just stack the leaves up neatly roll them up like in a cigar and then just do thin strips of it that's about a half a cup and just put right in and then just add a little bit of richness right at the end I'm gonna put in a tablespoon of butter and that's the sauce for grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers you know it's really just a good basic tomato sauce and I can imagine maybe with a little tomato paste putting it on pasta or serve it with any kind of fish that has enough flavor to stand up to it which the swordfish really does I'm just going to simmer that for a minute and then just turn it off and it's ready when I found my server and then I'm gonna grill the swordfish I think I'll grill it inside you can do it outside too but I'll show you how to do it inside and then serve it later the party at mustard farm really perfect [Music] grilled swordfish with swordfish with tomatoes and capers I love swordfish I had the fish store cut these about 1 inch thick I'm just gonna brush it with a little bit of olive oil it'll make a nice sear for it salt want to make sure you see isn't it really well pepper I'm gonna put them on a grill pan I've left it on high heat really high heat for about 3 to 4 minutes until it got really hot it's just you can see it's just starting to smoke I'm just gonna put the fish you want to put it on and just leave it otherwise you wanted to put grill marks if you keep moving it around seasoning side down then cook for about three minutes the meantime I'm going to oil the other side more salt and pepper you know we do this on the charcoal grill too it's delicious little pepper I'm just gonna let that cook on the grill for about three or four minutes while I get everything else ready for Frank so the sauce is ready put it right in the bottom of the platter [Music] then put the swordfish right on top of the stall this book I say these are gonna be very happy people at this Historical Society and it's this week great room temperature that's absolutely perfect you may be fresh basil on top actually I even prefer a big bunch of fresh basil so it says this is swordfish with tomatoes and basil and capers hi oh you're so good to do oh this is so kind of couscous and chocolate pudding and a grilled swordfish underneath I'm coming bad unless that's so kind of you to do that they're gonna appreciate this so much we like appreciate hey thank you [Music] whatever it is up water this is solving into the phone and makes it different Cheers yeah thanks again tonight over what the it seems to be going really well great [Music] good sharpener and at the end of the long day of cooking I have a nice to course dinner waiting for me chocolate pudding in a spoon [Music] and it's so chocolatey [Music]
everybody always says they don't want to have dessert but I don't remember anybody turning it down in my house one of the reasons I think is because I really make traditional deserves sometimes I'll make them in a different way like this time I'm going to make apple turnovers which are apples hearts for them doing them in puff pastry so the first thing I'm going to start with is three apples so I usually pick a fairly tart apple it's granny smith apples so if you want to mix them sometimes that's nice during apple season you can get something like a McCune or a Empire Apple so three greatest examples chopped up and then right away I want to put something aesthetic on this and they don't turn brown suzumiya-san orange does he sort of grated orange zest and three tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice that has an overage 3 tablespoons of sugar [Music] she's a tart apple so a little food whatever sort of flour [Music] teaspoon of cinnamon agency motive limit you can toss that together and then I'm going to use dried cherries to be really good for the tartness of the cherry and the apple it's a really good balance for each other about three tablespoons okay so it's a pinch of salt I know it's surprising but it makes a big difference it's actually a good idea at this point to just taste it and just be short it tastes just like apple pie okay that's the filling and now I'm going to make the pastry at times I feel like make my own pie crust and tons I just don't this is one of those times and the good news is it doesn't make any difference it's going to be really delicious so I'm going to use this frozen puff pastry this is layers and layers of layers ago and butter and when you put it in the oven it puffs up and it's really nice and money so it's going to roll out lightly till it's 12 by 12 make sure 12 I so wanted to make to the board you want be sure it stays really cold the trim piece making pie crust doesn't it okay 12 by 12 we're there so we cut this in quarters and one for the filling in each one [Music] so a little egg wash on all the edges and then when I crimp it it will feel it show you how this works just fold it right over take a fork and just crimp the edges the way you would with the pie crust he's going to get nice and brown sort of a golden brown color and there'll be just gorgeous right on the pan like that okay consistent out best thing is I can make this early in the day and just bake them before I'm serving them so we have nice hot apple turnovers looks pretty good and a little sprinkling of sugar and a little flick to let that steam when they big okay into the fridge I'm going to bake them off on my guests are here we'll have some silk apple pie thank you and this is cream if anybody would like some before
[Music] these days when I'm doing a menu for a party I find that a lot of my friends have things that they can to eat one doesn't like fish somebody's allergic to nuts but what I find is everybody loves pasta so when I'm entertaining while it's not all pasta all the time at my house it's very often on the menu this wouldn't be list of my favorite pasta so that was zhonya it's a ball time party classic and this one has a healthy twist and pasta pesto and peas salad sprinkled with toasted pignoli it's great on its own or with chicken as a side dish penne with five cheese's is on the list it's comforting and delicious that's incredibly easy to make and shrimp linguini fabulous flavor and ready in 15 minutes it works as well for small elegant dinner as for a big casual Sunday supper last but not least pasta with sun-dried tomatoes a summery dish filled with the flavors of tomato mozzarella and basil so that's what's on the menu I've got some pasta lasagna it's one of the great make-ahead meals you can make the lasagna bake it freeze it and it's always ready when friends come over [Music] so what I have in this pot is I've sautéed some onions and garlic and then broken up some sausage that I got at the store this is turkey sausage you can get hot you can get sweet but I actually like to combine the two so it's half and half it's about a pound and a half of sausage and it's well cooked in a little bit of a olive oil then I'm gonna add tomatoes a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes in puree if you use whole Tomatoes you can just put it in the food processor and crush them up yourself and a six ounce can of tomato paste the whole can I'm gonna glass of flavoring some fresh basil just pick up some leaves and chop it of course it's all gonna cook together anyway we love basil just so good with tomato some turkey sausage doesn't have to be perfect okay so right into the tomato and turkey sausage and then I think some fresh parsley you can use flat leaf parsley like this or you can use curly parsley I think this has a little more flavor but really depends on the parsley right into the pot I think we need salt and pepper 1/2 teaspoons of salt a lot of this depends on how salty and peppery the sausages so you want to taste it half a teaspoon of pepper and then just stir it up who's gonna like it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes over low heat until all the flavors blend together and the tomato and the basil and the turkey sausage all taste like one okay now I'm gonna get some cheese's ready I need 15 ounces of ricotta cheese which is usually one package and then I'm gonna put lots of flavors in it first thing is goat cheese I know it's unusual in a lasagna but I think it really gives a great flavor so this is the 4 ounce package we have a four and a half ounce package a five ounce package just too casual about it it's just fine just crumble it right up into the ricotta it's sort of a little more punch and kind of flavor it's good one cup of grated Parmesan just mix that in and then one egg you know when you're putting an egg into a mixture I always put it into another glass bowl because you never know when you get a bad egg so one egg extra large egg just mix that in and then just gonna add a little bit of flavor with some chopped parsley that two tablespoons and of course salt and pepper you don't need too much because the parmesan is pretty salty a quarter of a teaspoon of pepper and now what I'm gonna do is show you how he did the noodles and then I'm gonna layer the whole thing together with mozzarella it's gonna be fabulous what I do with the noodles is instead of boiling them I pour a really really really hot tap water into a ball and let the noodles soak for about 20 minutes and they soften up just enough to go into the baked lasagna okay now I'm just going to drain it I don't have to be perfect just cutting the fit please take about half the mozzarella and layer it on top and then the next layer is this cheese 2 rakaat about half the cheese with the ricotta and goat cheese and parmesan more sausage Oh another layer of noodles one mozzarella rest of the cheese it's amazing how fast this built up and there's nothing more strenuous to do than grate some parmesan home for it put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and I had a dinner party okay a little turkey lasagna it's the night as a feather because it's made with turkey sausage oh why ina this is so good how did you get this time to do this today I did it last week actually dirty little secret as I made everything last week was put in the freezer absolutely this is one of my favorite pastas but I have to say it has arrived that's pasta pesto and peas see how easy it is to make [Music] must've missed open please the first trick is frozen piece because I think they're actually delicious and when they're picked they're blanched and then frozen so they're just as good as shelling them yourself which could take forever I'm gonna pour them into a colander just run them on our hot water I just let them sit in the sink for a minute so I cook the pasta ready I actually made two different kinds bowties little bow ties and fusilli these but you can use any kind of dried pasta so the first thing I'm gonna do is make pesto just wonderful it's this basil and garlic really old-fashioned Italian thing I need a little bit of walnuts and the food processor at a quarter of a cup tablespoon pignoli so it's your pine nuts this is usually made with one of the other but I like the flavor when you make make it with both next ingredients garlic like three big pieces of garlic and salt and pepper salt lots of pepper I like it really spicy that's a pepper and then one and a half cups of basil dump it right in and I'm gonna puree this and then while that's going on a pour in about a third of a cup of olive oil [Music] so that's a basic pesto and then I'm going to add a few more ingredients to make a sauce for some Parmesan cheese I actually add spinach it's frozen chopped spinach that's been defrosted but a half a package and about three quarters of a cup of mayonnaise and just a squeeze of fresh lemon this is a really great sauce on pasta because it's spicy and it's flavorful and they were nice and lemon the lemon and the spinach are going to keep the pesto from turning brown [Music] just taste it to make sure it's perfect remember the sauce has to be really flavorful because the pasta doesn't have much flavor hmm it's garlic and spicy a little more salt it's also important for pesto really bring out the basil flavor so that's my sauce I toss it with the pasta and add some final ingredients let's see so that's the pasta and the pesto you toss it this together so you can really smell the garlic and you see the spinach has kept the pesto really green so now we have pasta pesto we need peas so I have the frozen peas that I've defrosted I'm just gonna add some maybe half a package and for lots of flavor I'm gonna add more Parmesan cheese it's a little more salt and pepper and the last ingredient is pignoli nuts I think these really add just a great flavor to the salad and they look great so it's creamy white so let's make sure these tastes all right it's been so much flavor parmesan but all I have to do is pack the salad and Chinese takeout containers and get the tea so everybody tell me would you like pasta pesto pasta pesto thank you we all say another thing I love about pasta is it can be a really romantic dinner for two or a huge pasta dinner for a family and I always have lots of ingredients that I can put together with a pasta so I'm gonna make pasta with five cheese's I don't know anybody who doesn't [Music] penny with five cheese's one of my favorite things to make for a party it actually comes from friends of mine who want a fabulous restaurant in Providence Rhode Island called Al Forno you won't believe how easy it is to make so the first thing I'm going to do is grate some fontina there are lots of different kinds of fontina but I really think that good Italian fontina is really the best okay that's the grated fontina so I'm gonna make the sauce now let's start with two cups of cream a cup of tomatoes that are actually crushed in tomato juice and then we're gonna add all kinds of cheeses half a cup of pecorino which is like Parmesan but it's really stronger and has lots of flavor half a cup of the fontina which I graded and this is the good stuff this is a gorgonzola it's Mountain gorgonzola and it's got lots of flavor and it's creamy and it's gonna really be good in the pasta this a wonderful dish because it's really a great way to use up leftover you get a chicken just put it in if you have salmon leftover just chuck it in and it all tastes wonderful together two tablespoons of ricotta and a little bit of fresh mozzarella maybe about a quarter of a pound this is good homemade mozzarella you can use buffalo mozzarella which is really soft and delicious just be sure it's good mozzarella this is looking good and fresh basil leaves this just gives it a really good flavor and sort of add something fresh to it which I love so that's everything for the sauce and I'm just gonna add the pasta I've cooked a pound of penne Rigate honey we've got this actually got it's this shape and its got ridges on it it really holds the sauce well I cooked it for about four minutes which is not long enough to cook it it's very al dente but it's gonna cook more when I bake the pasta just gonna dump this whole thing in toss it all together this actually doesn't even require salt or pepper because the pasta is really well salted in the water that I boiled it in and the cheese is like the Romano and the gorgonzola they have a lot of salt in them so I'm going to fill these dishes individual Breton dishes for the pasta and then each person will get their own serving of pasta when it's baked this way I just find that it's really creamy inside and crusty and brown on the top it's a great combination we're just gonna take a little bit of butter and dot it on the top so the top gets really nicely browned in ten minutes in a really hot 500 degree oven and the pening is done I just had to warm it up when we got home and went to the movies calm relaxed [Music] pasta salad will be really boring but not my pasta with sun-dried tomatoes it's got big flavors and lots of sauce and we start with cooked pasta about a half a pound pound of chopped tomatoes just diced up good tomatoes 3/4 of a cup of good chopped olives the olives that have pizza they'll always have better flavor so pick them yourself six sun-dried tomatoes chopped up these are sun-dried tomatoes in oil and a pound of good mozzarella don't buy the stuff in the grocery store that tastes like rubber tires buy good mozzarella makes all the difference in the world Luttrell is great for pasta salads when it's cold but it's also wonderful hot and hot pasta dishes so I'm gonna make the sauce 5 sun-dried tomatoes 2 tablespoons of good red wine vinegar [Music] six tablespoons of olive oil it's like making a vinaigrette with lots of flavor one teaspoon of papers two teaspoons of salt so it's really important your pasta flavor that's because of a teaspoon of black pepper just period [Music] it's gonna give all the bridges of a constant lots of flavor almost done with this recipe I just want to show you another recipe I love shrimp fufu unique it's really easy it's really delicious [Music] two more great ingredients to put into the pasta sun-dried tomatoes fresh basil lots of it and about a cup of grated Parmesan they all the difference in the world Parmesan I think we're just gonna pack it up in court containers and I can have all week for dinner I love really fast pasta recipes one of my favorites is shrimp linguini which I remember making my friend Michael when he came over he just said the scene the pasta was already cooked and I was ready to go with the shrimp [Music] okay then three tablespoons of olive oil and about three tablespoons of butter I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce of the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than flavor of garlic so one minute well I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is peeled and deveined from the fish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein yourself I'm gonna add a pound of the shrimp you just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor of the garlic is going to get into the shrimp so first thing I do is salt and pepper this shrimp want to have lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also it's a really strongly flavor just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides sounds good all that garlic and butter and oil have back to that take two spoons just toss them together essentially a great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and the sauce together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredient lemon zest lemon juice I like a little bit of heat so just a sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and you have two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to you can't really see them lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people are gonna eat them but though they'll see that it's women shrim that's got so much garlic in it we have to both eat it all this cooking pasta some really fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did but it's lunchtime but I'm having pasta with sun-dried tomatoes [Music] [Music] these days when I'm doing a menu for a party I find that a lot of my friends have things that they can't eat one doesn't like fish somebody's allergic to nuts but what I find is everybody loves pasta so when I'm entertaining while it's not all pasta all the time at my house it's very often on the menu this wouldn't be list of my favorite pastas without lasagna it's a ball Time party classic and this one has a healthy twist and pasta pesto and pea salad sprinkled with toasted pignoli it's great on its own but with the chicken as a side dish penne with five cheese's is on the list it's comforting and delicious that's incredibly easy to make and shrimp linguini fabulous

and then broken up some sausage that I got at the store this is turkey sausage you can get hot you can get sweet but I actually like to combine the two so it's half in here it's about a pound and a half of sausage and it's all cooked in a little bit of a olive oil and then I'm gonna add tomatoes a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes in puree if you use whole tomatoes you can just put it in the food processor and crush them up yourself and a six ounce can of tomato paste the whole can I'm gonna have lots of flavoring some fresh basil just pick up some leaves and chop it up of course it's all gonna cook together anyway we love basil and tastes so good with tomato some turkey sausage doesn't have to be perfect okay so right into the tomato and turkey sausage and then I think some fresh parsley you can use flat leaf parsley like this or you can use curly parsley I think this has a little more flavor but really depends on the parsley right into the pot I think we need salt and pepper and a half teaspoons of salt a lot of this depends on how salty and peppery the sausage is so you want to taste it half a teaspoon of pepper and then just stir it up I'm just gonna let this simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes over low heat until all the flavors blend together and the tomato and the basil and the turkey sausage all taste like one okay now I'm gonna get some cheese's ready I need 15 ounces of ricotta cheese which is usually 1 package and then good put lots of flavors in it first thing is goat cheese I know it's unusual and lasagna but I think it really gives a great flavor so this is the 4 ounce package we've have a four and a half ounce package or 5 ounce package just too casual about it it's just fine just crumble it right up into the ricotta it's there's a little more punch and kind of flavor it's good 1 cup of grated Parmesan just mix that in and then one egg you know when you're putting an egg into a mixture I always put it into another glass ball because you never know when you get a bad egg so one egg extra large it I can just mix that in and then just gonna add a little bit of flavor with some chopped parsley that two tablespoons and of course salt and pepper you don't need too much because the parmesan is pretty salty quarter of a teaspoon pepper and now what I'm gonna do is show you how he did the noodles and then I'm gonna layer the whole thing together with mozzarella it's going to be fabulous what I do with the noodles is instead of boiling them I pour really really really hot tap water into a ball and let the noodles soak for about 20 minutes and they soften up just enough to go into the baked lasagna okay now I'm just going to drain it just spread it up mush it around when did one layer of pasta I don't want to be perfect just cut me to fit please take about half mozzarella and layer it on top and then the next layer is this cheese to work on about half the cheese with the ricotta and goat cheese and Parmesan more sausage out another layer of noodles mozzarella rest of the cheese it's amazing how fast this builds up and there's nothing more strenuous to do than grate some parmesan whole bread I put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and I had a dinner party okay a little turkey lasagna it's the night as a feather because maybe with turkey sausage so it's that cheesy or Y ina this is so good how did you get the time to do this today I did it last week actually dirty little secret as I made everything last week was put in the freezer absolutely this is one of my favorite pastas but I have to say it has arrived that's pasta pesto and peas which mean how easy it is to make [Music] pasta pesto in peace my first trick is frozen peas because I think they're actually delicious and when they're picked they're blanched and then frozen so they're just as good as shelling them yourself which could take forever I'm gonna pour them into a colander just run them on our hot water I just let them sit in the sink for a minute so I cook the pasta ready I actually made two different kinds bow ties all the bow ties and fusilli these but you can use any kind of dried pasta so the first thing I'm gonna do is make a pesto just wonderful it's this basil and garlic really old-fashioned Italian thing I need a little bit of walnuts in the food processor got a quarter of a cup tablespoon pignoli such a pine nuts this is usually made with one of the other but I like to flavor when you make make it with both the next ingredient are like three big pieces of garlic and salt and pepper salt lots of pepper I like it really spicy that's a pepper and then one and a half cups of basil down right in
my friends are coming for an anniversary dinner and what I thought would be really great with the rack of lamb is orzo with roasted vegetables what it is is like roast all these vegetables a very high temperature and they get really sweet and delicious and then mix them with orzo which is a rice shaped pasta lemon vinaigrette feta fresh basil can be really delicious yellow pepper you can use anything you want to get orange peppers it's great and then the last thing is olive oil salt and pepper give it lots of flavor toss it all together and I'm going to roast this at a high temperature 425 for about 40 minutes until it's brown and crusty it's colorful it's delicious and it's good for you so now I'm going to do the final assembly on the orzo with roasted vegetables vegetables are all cooked in their crusty and brown just wonderful all the juices and it goes into the orzo which remembers the pasta that shaped like rice like I left to get all the juices and the bits of vegetables and in the bowl all the flavor next I'm going to do is make a vinaigrette which is this is a really simple lemon vinaigrette the third of a cup of lemon juice got to be fresh an equal amount of olive oil lots of salt really makes a difference in this remember the orzo doesn't have any salt in it at all so you want to make sure that it really has flavor whisk it together it's a wonderful vinaigrette for like a ruble and Parmesan or the both green salad so pour it over all the orzo and the vegetables just enough so it absorbs it it's really best to do this when the or goes hot because then it absorbs all that lemon vinaigrette and I'm going to add lots of really delicious fresh things like scallions lots of chopped scallions fresh basil leaves lots of feta he's really good said it makes a difference and toss it all together all the flavors of the basil and scallions and feta and sweet roasted vegetables and the last thing we put on toasted pignoli what I've done is heat them in the pan and a dry pan until they just browned I'm going to put them right on top fresh it's good for you

strenuous to do than grate some parmesan over it put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and I had a dinner party okay a little turkey lasagna it's light as a feather because it's made with turkey sausage so is that who is that cheesy or why ina this is so good how did you get the time to do this today last week a dirty little secret as I made everything less we can put in the freezer that tastes absolutely fresh this is one of my favorite pastas but I have to say it has arrival that's pasta pesto and peas I'll show you how easy it is to make [Music] pasta pesto and please my first trick is frozen peas because I think they're actually delicious and when they're picked they're blanched and then frozen so they're just as good as shelling them yourself which could take forever I'm gonna pour them into a colander just run them under hot water and just let me sit and think for a minute so I cook the pasta already I actually made two different kinds bowties little bow ties and fusilli these but you can use any kind of dried pasta so the first thing I'm gonna do is make pesto just wonderful it's this basil and garlic really old-fashioned Italian thing I need a little bit of walnuts and a food processor got a quarter of a cup tablespoons of pignoli switch our pine nuts pesto is usually made with one of the other but I like the flavor when you make make it with both next ingredient like three big pieces of garlic and salt and pepper salt lots of pepper I like it really spicy that's a pepper and then one and a half cups of basil just dump it right in then I'm gonna puree this and then while that's going on a pour in about a third of a cup of olive oil [Music] so that's basic pesto and then I'm gonna add a few more ingredients to make a sauce for some Parmesan cheese I actually add spinach it's frozen chopped spinach that's been defrosted about 1/2 a package and about 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise and just a squeeze of fresh lemon this is a really great sauce on pasta cuz it's spicy and it's flavorful there we go nice and lemon the lemon and the spinach are gonna keep the pesto from turning brown [Applause] just tasted to make sure it's perfect remember the sauce has to be really flavorful because the pasta doesn't have much flavor hmm it's garlicky and spicy a little more salt salt so important for pesto really bring out the basil flavor so that's my sauce I toss it with the pasta and add some final ingredients that's so that's the pasta and the pesto we've toasted this together so you can really smell the garlic and you see the spinach has kept the pesto really green so now we have pasta pesto we need peas so I have the frozen peas that I've defrosted I'm just gonna add some maybe half a package and for lots of flavor we're gonna add more Parmesan cheese it's a little more salt and pepper and the last ingredient is pignoli nuts I think these really add just a great flavor to the salad and they look great so it's green and white so let's make sure these tastes all right well it's been so much flavor parmesan and basil and garlic and all I had to do was pack the salad and Chinese takeout containers and hit the beach so everybody tell me what you like Oh God pasta pesto who would like pasta pesto is it good this is the perfect amphitheater in the beginning of the summer we all say another thing a little about pasta is it can be a really romantic dinner for two or a huge pasta dinner for a family and I always have lots of ingredients that I can put together with a pasta so I'm gonna make pasta with five cheese's I don't know anybody who doesn't anyway five cheese is one of my favorite things to make for a party it actually comes from friends of mine who want a fabulous restaurant in Providence Rhode Island called Al Forno you won't believe how easy it is to make so the first thing I'm going to do is grate some fontina there are lots of different kinds of fontina but I really think that good Italian fontina is really the best okay that's the grated fontina so I'm gonna make the sauce now let's start with two cups of cream a cup of tomatoes that are actually crushed and tomato juice and then we're gonna add all kinds of cheeses cap a cup of pecorino which is like parmesan but it's really stronger and has lots of flavor half a cup of the fontina which I graded and this is the good stuff this is gorgonzola it's Mountain gorgonzola and it's got lots of flavor and it's creamy and it's gonna really be good in the pasta this a wonderful dish because it's really a great way to use up leftovers if you have chicken just put it in if you have salmon leftover just chuck it in and it all tastes wonderful together two tablespoons of ricotta and a little bit of fresh mozzarella maybe about a quarter of a pound this is good homemade mozzarella you can use buffalo mozzarella which is really soft and delicious just be sure it's good mozzarella this is looking good and fresh basil leaves this just gives it a really good flavor and sort of add something fresh to it which I love so that's everything for the sauce and now I'm just gonna add the pasta I've cooked a pound of penne Rigate penne Rigate actually got it's this shape and its got ridges on it really holds the sauce well I cooked it for about four minutes which is not long enough to cook it it's very al dente but it's gonna cook more when I bake the pasta just gonna dump this whole thing in toss it all together this actually doesn't even require salt or pepper because the pasta is really well salted in the water that I boiled it in and the cheese is like the Romano and the gorgonzola they have a lot of salt in them so I'm going to fill these dishes individual gratin dishes for the pasta and then each person will get their own serving of pasta and when it's baked this way I just find that it's really creamy inside and crusty and browned on the top it's a great combination we're just gonna take a little bit of butter and dot it on the top so the top gets really nicely browned ten minutes in a really hot 500 degree oven and the penne is done I just had to warm it up when we got home and went to the movies calm relaxed [Music] pasta salad can be really boring but not my pasta with sun-dried tomatoes it's got big flavors and lots of sauce I'm gonna start with cook pasta about a half a pound pound of chopped tomatoes just dice up good tomatoes 3/4 of a cup of good chopped olives the olives that have pits and they'll always have better flavor so pick them yourself six sun-dried tomatoes chopped up these are sun-dried tomatoes in oil and a pound of good mozzarella don't buy the stuff in the grocery store that tastes like rubber tires buy good mozzarella makes all the difference in the world mozzarellas great for pasta salads when it's cold but I saw some wonderful hot and hot pasta dishes so I'm gonna make the sauce five sun-dried tomatoes two tablespoons of good red wine vinegar six tablespoons of olive oil it's like making a vinaigrette with lots of flavor [Music] one clove of garlic chopped 1 tsp of capers 2 teaspoons of salt it's all it's really important give pasta flavor that's recorders of a teaspoon of black pepper I'm just puree [Music] pour it out the salad it's gonna get all the ridges of a pasta lots of flavor almost done with this recipe I just want to show you another recipe I love shrimp with linguine it's really easy it's really delicious how bad is that [Music] two more great ingredients to put into the pasta with sun-dried tomatoes fresh basil lots of it and about a cup of grated Parmesan makes all the difference in the world based on Parmesan that I think I'm just gonna pack it up in court containers and I can happen all week for dinner I love really fast pasta recipes one of my favorites is shrimp linguini which I remember making for my friend Michael when he came over let me just set the scene the pasta was already cooked and I was ready to go with the shrimp okay that's three tablespoons of olive oil and about three tablespoons of butter I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce for the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than the flavor of garlic so one minute while I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is a peeled and deveined shrimp fish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein it yourself I'm gonna add a pound of shrimp you just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor of the garlic is gonna get into the shrimp so first thing I gonna do is salt and pepper the shrimp won't have lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also since we really strongly flavored just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides it's so good all that garlic and butter and oil how bad can that be two spoons just toss it all together essentially great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and the sauce together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredients a lemon zest lemon juice they're like a little bit of heat so just it's sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and then have two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to you can't really see the lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people are gonna eat them but they'll they'll see that it's lemon [Music] linguini with shrimp that's got so much garlic in it we have to both eat it all this cooking pasta some really fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did but it's lunchtime but I'm having pasta with sun-dried tomatoes [Music] you
[Music] when I'm having a party I almost never actually make something to serve with drinks so when some things is easy and delicious as tuna tapenade I make an exception tapenades actually an olive paste from South of France and I'm going to turn up the volume and add tuna to it okay that's 12 ounces of Italian tuna most good already next ingredient is very Provencal anchovy paste and put in 2 teaspoons basically anchovies pureed with some spices love it 1 teaspoon of thyme give it a big rough chop that should be about a teaspoon fresh thyme is really important and 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley just give it a big rough chop remember it's all going to be pureed in the food processor when this is done I'm going to serve on crostini which has thin slices of spread that have been oiled and toasted a little bit so it's crunchy it's going to be delicious with it okay that's about 2 tablespoons next it's to close a garlic chopped give it lots of Provencal flavor and the next is the zest of one lemon okay so best assess of one lemon probably about a tablespoon just right in just go put the lid on and just pulse it I don't want to puree I want it really roughly chopped let's just break up the tuna perfect now for freshly squeezed lemon juice okay three tablespoons well cheap it's never hurt okay next is three tablespoons of olive oil this is like making a vinaigrette lemon juice and olive oil next is the third of a cup of mascarpone what's the point is is incredible Italian creamy cheese it's going to give that quick twist in the blender to puree okay now Alice can't have tough enough without olives quarter of a cup of pitted olives I actually use kalamata olives I think they have a really great sort of whiny flavor not one you like people wine you like wine okay right in table sort of capers this is provençal everything has capers drained capers okay and just to make sure it has great flavor one teaspoon salt a source of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and just get that over you want a two pureed but you want a well mixed I'm gonna let it sit in the fridge first a couple of hours so all the flavors blend together it's actually one of the reasons why this is a great thing to make for hors d'oeuvres you can actually make it a day in advance and just taste better how great is that I love the texture of this especially sort of smooth and creamy but you can still see the olives and you can see the parsley and you can smell the lemon so it's all there this Dishman you actually have a lot of Italian ingredients in it it's actually Mediterranean and it's perfect southern promo style dish to serve with a nice glass of rose a foragers just definitely sure it's good my friends are going to love this one
[Music] I think this any dish I've made more than Parmesan chicken so for a mystery guest I have no idea what they like I'm going to try something really safe everybody loves this so the first thing I want to do is make the crust for the chicken I'm going to do a cup of flour teaspoon of pepper and teaspoon of salt so mix that all together totally flour egg and bread crumbs I need two eggs a tablespoon of water beat this together and then the bread crumbs I need a cup of bread crumbs I use seasoned bread crumbs you don't have to make your home make sure they fresh though that they haven't been sitting in the pantry for a long time and Parmesan cheese which is why it's Parmesan chicken so for the parmesan I'm just going to use actually ground Parmesan and for this it has to be very finely ground so that it distributes itself really well on the crust so I'm just going to chop this up put it in the food processor and I just grind it up [Music] half-assed attack I just need a half a cup right into the breadcrumbs I'm just going to miss out together now for the chicken and they pound it so it's tenderized and it's actually very even so it's time for rolling pin simply pepper really fit okay that's done time to cook the chicken tablespoon of butter tablespoon of olive oil and I'm going to take each chicken breast first dip it in the flour make sure it's completely coated shake it off dip it in the egg and water and then dip it in the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese okay right into the pan let's cook it for bit two to three minutes on each side [Music] okay this is nice and brown on this side just going to turn it over that looks good okay perfect browned on that side you can tell if the chicken bounces back it's perfectly done on to the sheet pan [Music] okay into the oven very low oven 200 degrees and they'll just stay warm until we're ready for dinner well that's a crowd I don't want to leave for too long so I'm glad I did the Parmesan chicken in advance so the first thing I do is make lemon vinaigrette I need a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice half a cup of olive oil just salt half a teaspoon of pepper just whiz it nicely watch letters that I washed it in advance take for the vinaigrette on and that's going to go on the chicken so the hot chicken and the cold salad the great combination all I have to do is plate up the chicken cold salad on the top shaving a parmesan and I'm back to the fun
so we're off to the beach of the dogs and since we're having hot dogs or chicken sausages I thought what would be more perfect with its and really good potato salad so the potatoes are done I'm going to drain them so I took them for about 10 minutes and then I let them steam for another 10 minutes so that's three pounds of new potatoes for small ones you can use red ones or white ones whichever you likes and I'm just going to let them steam and the steam really gets into the potatoes and cooks them beautifully so next I'm going to make the sauce so 1 cup of mayonnaise quarter of a cup of buttermilk or white wine or chicken stock whatever you have just let's get together until it's creamy so adding some kind of liquid to mayonnaise take the whip that sort of gloppy flavor and it makes it more like a sauce now I'm going to lots of flavor two tablespoons of Dijon mustard two tablespoons of coarse mustard it's this grainy mustard really has great flavor and it also looks like mustard so you know exactly what's in it and then lots of fresh dill that I have a cup of chopped fresh dill and that should be about a half a cup teaspoon of salt teaspoon of pepper I'm just going to whisk this all together and I've got this off actually in the summer you can make a huge amount of this if you're having potato salad a lot and then just use that you make the potatoes darling leave it in the fridge okay potatoes should be ready so going to clean up a little bit and see how they are perfect and they look beautiful so let me cut up the potatoes and she's going to quarter these guys if they're really big you can cut them in smaller pieces but quarters are just about right I use small round potatoes so you use the skins they're very thin skin and actually the skins have a lot of nutrition in them so that's it for the potatoes and then I let them cool a little bit while I chop up some celery and red onion for it one of the things that's really important for me when I'm making salads it's not just the flavor and the color but also the texture and with this salads really nice to have a little bit of a crunch with the celery and red onions so I need maybe about a half a cup of celery and red onion in this nice rough chop remember this the homemade salad supposed to look like a homemade shell don't obsess about having perfect size pieces that's crazy [Music] when you're cutting red onions leave the back part attached keep your fingers out of the way just do slices like that and then cut straight down really let the blade do the work by moving it rather than pushing it move the blade that's a couple red onion that's going to give a nice flavor okay thank you is it cool enough so we put the dressing on [Music] toss it all together this is great salad because if it's it's a little bit really absorbs into the flavor of the potatoes this looks good and then toss in all the red onion and celery give it lots of crunch and flavor it's really correct I'm actually not going to check it for seasonings right now because it's warm and it's going to be served cold better to check the seasonings when it's the temperature you're going to eat it so I want to put in the refrigerator and pack it up later and take it to the beach
&gt;&gt;Marissa: Good morning. Thank you guys, all, for coming. We are very excited today to be welcoming the Barefoot Contessa, Ina Garten, here to San Francisco. [applause] &gt;&gt;Ina: Not nearly as excited as I am to be here. &gt;&gt;Marissa: And Ina's here for the Fancy Food Show, but we were lucky to snag her for a visit here today. And so, by the way, we also have-- she has a new cookbook out called "How Easy Is That?" And so, there's a hundred of those available if you wanna snag one. Ina will sign cookbooks afterwards and you can come up and meet her and ask her your questions. We also have the questions on the Dory Page, but we're really, really excited to have you. So, I'm gonna go ahead and go through a little bit of your background which I think everyone here is probably already familiar with, but I think there's some really great parts to it. So, Ina and I met last April at a women's event and we got to hear a little bit about our stories, each other's stories and it was just really fun. And we've met again since, through our friend, Juliet du Baubigny at Kleiner Perkins, one of our original VC firms because Juliet turns out to be Ina's neighbor-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Next door neighbor of all things. &gt;&gt;Marissa: in the Hamptons. [Marissa laughs] And so, I went to see Juliet this summer and we were going to dinner at her neighbors' and it turned out to be Ina, so we met again there. And so, I actually have had dinner and brunch in Ina's famous kitchen. [Marissa laughs] &gt;&gt;Ina: It was one of my-- &gt;&gt;Marissa: And it was really, really amazing. &gt;&gt;Ina: great pleasures. It was one of my great pleasures to say to Juliet, "Oh, I know Marissa." [Ina and Marissa laugh] &gt;&gt;Marissa: I had one of the best coffee cake I've ever had with sugar rolled into the crust; it was amazing. [Ina and Marissa laugh] But Ina's story is really fascinating because she started off working in the White House. &gt;&gt;Ina: I did. Nuclear energy policy. How light is that? &gt;&gt;Marissa: I was gonna say, it's amazing. Budget analyst, writing the nuclear energy budget and policy papers on nuclear centrifuge for Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. [Ina and Marissa laugh] &gt;&gt;Ina: You know, science, cooking; it actually is related. [laughter] Except, instead of hydrochloric acid, you end up with coffee cake. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: I think we can all appreciate that. All of us here like to apply science in unusual ways. &gt;&gt;Ina: It's more fun. &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, and then as she was working there, saw an ad for a specialty food store that was for sale in the Hamptons called "The Barefoot Contessa," and she bought the store and scaled it. And so, much like we've scaled Google, Ina scaled it from a 400 square foot shop to now over three thousand square foot shop. It moved twice and was this very, very successful business. She sold it to two of the employees in 1996, and then wrote a cookbook. And I actually want Ina to tell the story, but I think it was really interesting about how you made the bridge from the store to the cookbook. &gt;&gt;Ina: Actually, Marissa and I were talking about this, I always wanted to-- I'd been doing the store for about 20 years and I thought, "You know, it's really time to do something else." And for a couple of years, I was saying, "Well, what is that? What is that? I've gotta know what it is." And a friend of mine said to me, "Type A people think they can figure out what they're gonna do next while they're doing something, and they can't." [chuckles] She said, "You have to quit. You just have to do nothing for a year." And so, that's when I thought, "OK, I'll sell the store to two employees, the chef and the manager, and then I'll just have nothing to do." [laughter] If you think that's easy, it's not. I built myself an office upstairs in the building that we had, where the store was and I sat there for a year with nothing to do. My husband, Jeffrey, is at Yale, and he would leave on Monday and come back on Friday. And when he left on Monday one week, I said, "I have nothing to do." [laughter] I said, "Wait a minute." I looked at my schedule. I said, "I have a manicure on Wednesday and that's it." [laughter] But it really was out of sheer, total boredom. One day I'd been baking a thousand baguettes and running a store with a hundred employees, and the next day had nothing to do. After about, I think, nine months, out of sheer boredom I thought, "Well, I have to do something." And Jeffrey said, "Stay in the game. You love the food business. Just do something in the food business." And I thought, "Well, I never wanted to write a cookbook" cause I thought it would be boring, but, "OK, maybe I'll write a cookbook just so I have something to do tomorrow." And it never would have happened if I hadn't started and then it turned out cookbook writing is really interesting. &gt;&gt;Marissa: And of course… &gt;&gt;Ina: So, it was very good advice. &gt;&gt;Marissa: … the cookbooks led to the television show-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Television show, yes-- &gt;&gt;Marissa: which I heard that you actually turned down the proposal the first time around. &gt;&gt;Ina: Over and over and over again. [laughter] Food Network was at a moment--and Marissa knows this-- Food Network was at a moment when they had the French chefs with the big toques and everybody, and there was nothing; triple-layer mousses and there was one woman at Food Network who said, "I think it should be of people that do home-cooking, people who really understand how people cook at home." And she went out and found four people. She found Rachel Ray, Paula Dean, Giada and me, and to this day, that really is the basis of Food Network. And I just said, "No, no, no, no, no, I could never do that. Cooking on television? Forget it." So, she went away and came back about six months later with a better offer. [laughter] And I thought, and I said, "No, no, no. I'm not negotiating. I really don't want to do this." She came back six months later with a better offer-- [laughter] and I was like, "No. Go away." [laughter] And in the meantime, a friend of mine who had gone to Australia and seen a TV show, a cooking show, that he thought was interesting and so I went to Food Network and said, "Could you get me a copy of this show so I could see it?" And it was fantastic. And I said, "But I still don't wanna do a TV show." [laughter] And so, the Food Network went to London, found the producer, hired them and called me and said, "They're coming to East Hampton. Now will you do it?" And I was like, "Whoa." So, I agreed to do 13 shows, thinking that would solve that and here we are nine years later. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: And an Emmy. I mean, I will say that actually, the Emmy is as sharp, heavy, and pointy as you'd expect. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Ina: It is. &gt;&gt;Marissa: One of the dinner guests managed to see it tucked deep in the corners amidst some papers in Ina's office. &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, really? &gt;&gt;Marissa: We all went in and held it, so-- &gt;&gt;Ina: It has a twin. It has a twin sister now. [laughter] A second one. &gt;&gt;Marissa: A pair of them. And I will say, I mean, Ina obviously is just phenomenally popular, admired all over. The first day that I met her, as I said, we were at this women's event and it happened, and just by happenstance, Oprah Winfrey happened to be there. And when I first met Ina, Oprah Winfrey, there was a fan of Ina's that was so excited to see Ina; she shoved Oprah out of the way. [laughter] She was like, "Oh my God! Ina Garten!" And I was like, "That was Oprah." [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: And there I was standing on the podium and Oprah's next to me and she didn't speak to me the whole time. I thought, until a few nights ago, I never understood why. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, that's a little bit of background. So, we have some questions. I have some questions, here. We have questions from our group and we also can take questions from the mic. So, if you wanna ask Ina a question, you can come here. We have mics in the center and on the side here if you wanna ask a question. &gt;&gt;Ina: I'll bet there's an algorithm for hearing the most popular question. Where else? [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: And actually, the question I was gonna start with is at the top of the Dory, so I will just go to that, which is, "Well, my question was do you have a favorite dish that you just love to make?" And I know it's hard; it's almost like asking someone to pick a favorite child. &gt;&gt;Ina: Child. No, no no. It's actually, I have a few. I have a few, but my go-to meal when somebody's coming, they've never been there before and I've got a million things going on, is a meal that's in my Parties book, which is rack of lamb and orzo with roasted vegetables and it's so easy and it's absolutely delicious and nobody can believe that you, I mean, everybody thinks you worked all day on it. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, I guess that's the go-to. What do you think makes a good chef? It's hard, but what are the qualities? &gt;&gt;Ina: That's a really interesting question. I just think if people that really, I think what-- I'm not a restaurant chef, I'm not brilliant cook. I just think I really care about flavor and the texture of how things taste. And so, I think if somebody's really interested in that, you're willing to just keep going until it's exactly the way you want it to be, rather than settling. And somebody once said to me, and it's really amazingly true, "There are two ingredients that everybody has in their house that is very often the difference between something that's fairly ordinary and something that's absolutely delicious, and it's salt and pepper." [audience chuckles] It's -- most things aren't seasoned properly and I think that really makes a huge difference and I'm not happy unless it tastes fantastic. So, I think that's really what makes a good chef -- is a real passion for a really satisfying, delicious, and it can be also a very simple meal. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Sure. So, is that what you would say the biggest mistake most chefs make is not seasoning properly? &gt;&gt;Ina: Biggest mistake: salt. It's amazing what a difference it makes. The other day, I was testing a recipe for braised lamb shanks for my next book and I said to my assistant, "Taste it and see what you think." And I hadn't tasted it – the finished -- ; it had just come out of the oven and she said, "Mmm, it's OK. It's not great." And I tasted it and I said, "OK, I'll be right back." Salt, pepper and a splash of white wine and I said, "Taste it now." And she was like, "Oh my God! This is the best thing I ever ate." [laughter] And it was the same dish. It was so amazing what that, so I think that's the biggest mistake. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Very cool. So, let me have a couple of, I think I have a quick question just to pick your brain. [Ina laughs] So-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Let's see, the smartest people on the planet. [Ina laughs] [audience laughs] Just go ask anything. &gt;&gt;Marissa: One was three cooking utensils that are the most important to you. [pause] &gt;&gt;Ina: Good, sharp knives. Critical. Doesn't have to be a hundred knives; it has to be three really, good knives. I love a zester, like those rasps because I usually think that the zest on a lemon or an orange or something has more flavor than the juice itself. And half-sheet pans; I have a stack of them. Everything goes in a half-sheet: brownies, roasted carrots, rack of lamb, everything. I mean, obviously you need more equipment than that, like an oven. [laughter] But, I mean, those are things I literally couldn't live without. &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, another question from the Dory. Say it's your last day. It's kind of morbid, but-- [Ina laughs] What would your meal be? &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, that's interesting because I actually was asked this question. Somebody auctioned off a cocktail party or something for benefit, and these young women came; they were just adorable. And they said-- one of them was British-- and she said, "What's your hangman’s meal?" And I was like, "What's that?" [laughter] It turns out it's the same thing; it's your last dinner. And I said, "I don't know what it would be, but I know it would have really good Chateau de Camp Sauternes with every single course." [laughter] So, the first one might be foie gras. I know it's completely not PC, but it would be foie gras. The second one would probably be a lobster, like a grilled lobster thing, which is great with Chateau de Camp. And the third one would be a very thin French apple tart with Chateau de Camp. So, I think-- [laughter] the prison would be really out of a lot of money if I ordered that as my last meal. &gt;&gt;Marissa: We'll go ahead and take a question from the audience. &gt;&gt;audience #1: Hi. Hello. I'd like to ask about copyright intellectual property issues in writing a cookbook. I've got a wonderful pile of recipes from aunts and Mom and acquaintances and can you use those in a cookbook? &gt;&gt;Ina: As long as they're not copyrighted, yes, absolutely. Sure. &gt;&gt;audience #1: Thanks. &gt;&gt;Ina: That shouldn't be any problem. I would probably ask their permission just to be nice. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #1: Some of them are so old. They're 30 years old and I have no idea where they came from. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, yeah. Absolutely you could-- &gt;&gt;audience #1: Thanks. &gt;&gt;Ina: and that would be wonderful to publish all those old recipes. &gt;&gt;audience #1: Thank you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: And we have a lot of people who are interested in the actual filming of the television show. So, is it actually filmed in your kitchen? &gt;&gt;Ina: It is filmed in my house. It actually is and we've been doing it there, originally in my house and then I built this huge barn, which Marissa knows, next door. So, my commute to work is about 50 yards. [Ina laughs] And yeah, we do film that. I just think it always feels like a set and I love when we do the parties. It's a real party. They're my friends and I tell the director, "Just leave us alone." We just have to have a good time; you can't fake it. If you're not having a good time, it doesn't look like a good time. So, it's really wonderful. I love the people. It's the same producer that originally started and yeah, it's great. And I get to cook in my own kitchen. [Ina and Marissa laugh] &gt;&gt;Marissa: And then a compliment in the form of a question of, "Does Jeffrey know he's the luckiest man in the world?" [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: The dirty little secret is I'm high maintenance. [laughter] He was stopped at a restaurant recently and someone said, "Do you know that you're the best fed man in America?" He didn't take that quite as a compliment. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: And everyone here knows, but we had Ina do our Thanksgiving Doodle and so-- &gt;&gt;Ina: That was so much fun. &gt;&gt;Marissa: The original idea was well; we knew we wanted to maybe have a chef cook the Doodle. And then we thought, "OK. What chef is really popular who would be cooking a Thanksgiving dinner?" And so, we asked Ina to do it. She obliged and so then we were so inspired by it that we realized we didn't just want to run it on Thanksgiving Day; we wanted to do it in the lead-up to Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt;Ina: So people could shop for the ingredients. &gt;&gt;Marissa: So people could shop for the ingredients and do the recipes. And so, our Doodler staff was also in the kitchen and has also done a photo shoot with Ina. And so, one of the questions is, "What was it like being involved in the Google Doodle?" &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I mean, it started out with an email from Marissa and she knows I was walking around all day going, "Oh my God!" [laughter] It was wonderful. It was absolutely wonderful. It was in the middle of my book tour and the only day that we could find to do it was a Sunday. So, I mean, they flew in and it was Preston and Mike Dutton. Preston Hershorn and Mike Dutton if they're here. And, oh, there they are. [laughter] And it was so much fun and you just think, "Oh, we'll just whip something up." And as we all know from the photo shoot, it's never "you just whip something up." We had two turkeys ready; we had two of everything. And it was a real exciting day. It was wonderful. &gt;&gt;Marissa: It was a beautiful day. &gt;&gt;Ina: And it was fun to see the photographs that we were taking. The photographer had the digital image, and then to see Mike and Preston move it into the actual Doodle. So, it was thrilling. It doesn't get any better than that. &gt;&gt;Marissa: We had a great response to that. &gt;&gt;Ina: Did you have a great response? &gt;&gt;Marissa: We had a great response to that. &gt;&gt;Ina: OK, good. &gt;&gt;Marissa: I mean, probably you saw some of that, too, but we were out on NPR, like hundreds of mentions all over the Web-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh how fabulous. &gt;&gt;Marissa: and let alone the tweets, right? The tweets just were I think, probably numbered in the hundreds of thousands. &gt;&gt;Ina: I saw there was a panic somewhere. [laughter] That was good. That was a good description. &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, one of the questions is, "Since you're here in the Bay area, are there any restaurants that you love going out to here?" &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I love being here because the food is amazing. I mean, just from the farmer's market at the Ferry Building, but I have to say secretly, the best meal I've ever had was at Marissa's house and it was the chef at Quince, which is just fantastic. [laughter] It was really stunning; both the food and the wine, it was just incredible. Thank you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: This is Michael Tusk, one of the local chefs. He did a really good job. His pasta is just to die for. That's what he's most known for. &gt;&gt;Ina: It was just fantastic. And last night, we went to Tyler Florence's restaurant, Wayfare Tavern, which was great. Which was great. Everybody, I love, there's something just so democratic about food here. It's just available to everybody and I've always loved Zuni Cafe. And the first time I went there, we took a taxi from the hotel to the cafe and the taxi driver said, "Oh, you've just gotta get the roast chicken and the Caesar salad." And I thought, "How great is that?" [laughter] And here, everybody always telling we're going to Wayfare Tavern and they were like, "Oh, you have to get the fried chicken and you have to put the lemon on it. It's really important." I was like, "That's good." [laughter] So, I just love that it's available to everybody who really cares about good food and it shows. &gt;&gt;Marissa: We've got a live question. &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh. Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #2: Hi Ina, and thanks so much for coming. This is really fun. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you for inviting me. &gt;&gt;audience #2: So, I think it's safe to say that you've been a really big inspiration to a lot of people who either haven't cooked before or who just want to enhance their skills and whatnot and become better chefs. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #2: But what I'm curious to find out is what inspires you and if you could walk us through the process of what it's like to come up with a new recipe and put something together? &gt;&gt;Ina: You know, a friend of mine always said, and I think it's really true, "You can't have ideas sitting home by yourself." You have to get out there, especially in this design world and the world of food; you have to see what's going on. One thing that I learned about having a specialty food store is the food that you eat at home is very different from the food you eat in a restaurant. And so, it's home cooking that I'm really interested in. When I first started, I would do like, veal with morels in the store and nobody would buy it. [laughter] And then I remember putting out a huge platter of chicken that had fresh herbs on the platter. It looked just gorgeous. Nobody bought one of them. So, I took the platter, I went back into the kitchen and I came out with chicken in those little, red paper cups that you get French fries in and lined them up on the counter and they just flew out of the store. So, I thought, "OK, it's about home cooking." And so, what I like to do is go to specialty food stores, but even sometimes I go to Milan and see the colors of the new fashions. And one year, I remember when I was doing my first book, they were doing cantalope and azure blue and raspberry together and I thought, "Oh, that's good for the colors of the book." And that's what I did. So, I think about something that I would wanna eat and I say this-- I'm like an idiot savant about what people want to eat-- nobody wants to eat fish eyeballs in foam. [laughter] You wanna eat roast chicken and rack of lamb. And so, I start with an idea of what I want it to taste like and what I want the texture to be, and if I don't I never get where I'm going. But if I do, it's that little ping in my head that says, "OK, that's exactly what I was looking for." And it could take two tries or it could take 25 tries, but I don't stop until I get there. &gt;&gt;audience #2: And then you've [ ] a lot of books, TV show, what's next for you? &gt;&gt;Ina: I always say this; if it just stays just the way it is right now, I'll be very happy. And then something comes along the screen and I go, "Oh, that might be fun." [laughter] But it's gotta be fun. &gt;&gt;audience #2: Thanks. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #3: Thank you very much for coming. My question is actually very similar to hers. I think that you've all given us a very inspirational story for how you've gotten to where you are now, but I think a lot of us are curious to know what's on the horizon? If there are any things, a direction for your next cookbook, or if there's something aside from writing cookbooks or appearing on TV that you'd like to do with the inspirational journey that you've already gone on? &gt;&gt;Ina: I just always, I keep doing, I get up in the morning, I think, "What would be interesting to do today?" And it's just, for me, just putting one foot in front of another and doing what I think is really interesting and challenging myself. And I always feel like the rest of it follows. &gt;&gt;audience #4: I have two teenage daughters who are 15 and 17 and I'm realizing they're gonna go off to college soon and I haven't done a very good job of teaching them how to cook. [Ina laughs] We normally go to Panda Express, but-- [Ina laughs] I'm working on that. I'm working on that. I was just wondering if you have any tips on teaching our children, our teenagers how to cook so that they like it, so that they don't associate it with a chore-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Work. &gt;&gt;audience #4: and any particular tips or recipes that you have for teenagers. &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I think now it's not the situation where mom's at home all the time and teaching everybody how to cook and enjoying it and transferring that pleasure. I actually think Food Network has been amazing because kids all watch Food Network. And particularly, I like that boys, eight year old boys are cooking because of Bobby Flay and Emeril and all the guys who are. It's fun. They just see that its fun, that it's really exciting and I think the biggest lesson, is that if you cook, everybody shows up. And it's that simple. It really is, so if you enjoy everybody showing up, they'll learn to cook. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #5: Hey. &gt;&gt;Ina: Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #5: Thanks for coming. &gt;&gt;Ina: Sure. &gt;&gt;audience #5: I have a two part question. So, I just read Anthony Bourdain's book, "Medium Raw", and have related to your fish eyes and-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah. Blerg. &gt;&gt;audience #5: First, what's your take on Anthony Bourdain and what's he like in person if you ever met him? [laughter] Just cause I love him, and second-- &gt;&gt;Ina: I love Anthony Bourdain. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #5: Do you think home cooking can be as high culinary as these crazy creations such as making foams and eating eyeballs and other kind of small plate type things where you pay a lot of money? &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, a lot of this really molecular gastronomy requires equipment and I would never have that equipment cause nobody has it. I think home cooking is much more satisfying, more traditional. I think people go out sometimes for a satisfying meal, but also to be challenged. So, I think that-- I went to a restaurant with a friend of mine and she ordered oyster ice cream and I was just like, "Oh God, nobody ever needs to eat oyster ice cream." [laughter] So, this doesn't inspire me to wanna make it at home, but I think you certainly can. But you always have the feeling, I remember when I was first married, I read an article for young brides, which was eons ago, that said if you spend the entire day making dinner for your husband, he can't possibly appreciate it enough. And it’s not his fault, it's your fault. So, if you spend the entire day making dinner for your friends or your family or whatever, they can't possibly appreciate it enough. They're gonna eat it in half an hour no matter what it is. So, I think the simpler it is, the more satisfying it is to them, but also to you. So, I think, and actually I think Anthony Bourdain's fantastic. I love what he does. I actually haven't met him, but I love his work and he's fantastic. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: I think it's interesting because one of the things we do here at Google is we have this thing we call "Dog Food." &gt;&gt;Ina: Dog Food? [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;Marissa: Meaning to eat your own dog food. So, one of the things we do is similar to you having just one oven and trying to put yourself in the space of the users is-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Yes, yes. &gt;&gt;Marissa: we make a point of using all the Google products. &gt;&gt;Ina: That's really nice. Exactly the same thing-- &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, like everything, Google Docs runs on, we do all of our doc work on Google Docs-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah. &gt;&gt;Marissa: and Calendar and Android phones and so-- &gt;&gt;Ina: That's funny; eat your own dog food. &gt;&gt;Marissa: everyone uses the products so they can really be in the place of the user, and in your case, of the viewer, the person trying to cook. &gt;&gt;Ina: I think that's a really important point. And actually, once I figured out a recipe, that's just the beginning of how I test the recipe. I then hand the recipe, once I figured exactly what I want to do, I hand it to my assistant and I say to her-- she's never with nothing else other than a printed page-- I say, "Make this." And I sit there and watch her. And she does the craziest things-- [laughter] that would never occur to me to do. And so then I write the recipe around that because that's what somebody at home is gonna do. And I've been in the food business too long; it would never occur to me to stir the caramel with a spoon. So, you have to swirl it in the pan. And then the next thing I do is what I call "road testing" it, which is, I put it together with a meal and I feed it to my friends and sometimes they're invited for six desserts because I wanna see which one they wanna eat. And that's my road testing the recipes. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Road testing the coffee cake was unbelievable. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: I'm hoping the recipe is in the book. &gt;&gt;Ina: It is. [Ina and Marissa laugh] It's on my email; I'll send it to you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Let's go ahead for another question there. &gt;&gt;audience #6: Would you mind sharing a story of making a dish that went horribly wrong? [Ina and audience #6 laugh] &gt;&gt;Ina: Horribly wrong. I tend not to make something that I haven't made before, literally even for dinner for Jeffrey. I do remember when we first got married, I made some recipe that had ground beef and corn in it that was just dreadful. [laughter] Something that's just gone horribly wrong. I remember a dessert just didn't happen right. I mean, I don't know what happened and it was the genesis. I thought, "Oh my God. People are coming in like, an hour, and I don't have dessert." And I decided, well, I had some creme fraiche and honey and vanilla and I made honey vanilla creme fraiche for the berries that I had in the refrigerator. And it was the genesis of one of the best recipes I've written. It was really simple and it was, it's out of the disastrous that something good comes out of it. [laughter] Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #7: Hi. I have just a quick question related to the last question. How do you handle it when a recipe fails and you have company? Do you apologize? Do you ignore it? What's the best steps of handling and communicating the disaster? &gt;&gt;Ina: I say nobody ever needs to know. [laughter] It's that simple. I remember being at a friend’s house for a dinner party and we're all, it was like, 20 people for dinner and we were all having cocktails and everybody’s having a good time and it got later and later and later. And everybody said, "You go into the kitchen and find out what's going on." So, I went in and it turns out she had set out all the first courses on the table and her two dogs had jumped on the table and gone all the way down the table and eaten everybody's first course. [laughter] And she was trying to make a first course. And I said to her, "You know what? Just forget the first course. Let's just have dinner, we'll sit down and nobody will ever know." So, nobody ever needs to see you sweat. &gt;&gt;audience #7: Great. &gt;&gt;Ina: And if all else fails, there's always take-out pizza. And you can, a friend of mine actually has what she calls her "disaster Christmas party." Every year something horrible happens and they just laugh about it and those are the ones -- the caterer got stuck in traffic and then the sofa caught on fire one time. [laughter] It's always something, and those are the best parties. [laughter] So, you just have a good laugh about it and nobody ever needs to know. &gt;&gt;audience #7: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #8: Hi. As a beginning home cook, out of college where all you cook with is a microwave and whatever you steal from a cafe. [Ina laughs] What are the three basic things that you need for a home cook -- because I think watching TV shows, it can be very overwhelming. They have a Kitchen Aid, a food processor and everything. &gt;&gt;Ina: I'm thinking if there's anything that you can't cook if you have knives and half-sheet pans. You can make roast chicken, you can make roast carrots, and maybe one sauce pan that you can make some pasta in. You really, this is a book I'd really love to write is the only ten recipes you need to know, because if you can make a roast chicken, you can make roast Cornish hens; you can make a roast turkey. It's the same process; it's just slightly different times. If you can make a chicken pot pie, you can make a lobster pot pie; you can make a vegetable pot pie. So, choose one thing, like a roast chicken, which is actually really simple to do; test it when you don't have any guests, so you learn how to do it and just keep making it over and over again. Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #9: Thanks for coming here today and-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Nice to see you again. &gt;&gt;audience #9: my wife is definitely one of your biggest fans. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #9: So, we talked a little bit about how you got into television, but you also made the jump from the White House to the Barefoot Contessa. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what inspired you to do that and what advice you would give to other people who are looking to make that sort of a career jump. &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, you know, when I was in my 20s, my husband was in the White House in the State Department; he worked for Kissinger. And I just thought I was the leading generation of women that were starting to work; it never occurred to me to have a career. And so, in my 20s, I wanted to grow up to be Jeffrey. And when I hit 30, I thought, "He's great, but I don't wanna be him." [laughter] He's like the intellectual in the family. I just wanna have fun. So, what I used to do when I wasn't working was have dinner parties -- every Saturday, I'd have a dinner party and I'd work my way through Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking", Volume I and Volume II, and I thought, "Well, maybe I should be doing that instead." And I was sitting in my office in the White House, trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up and there was an ad for a specialty foods store for sale. And I went home and I said to Jeffrey, "I gotta do something else." And he said, "Well, pick something you think would be really fun. Pick something. Don't worry about making money. Think about what you love to do because if you love it, you'll be really good at it." And I said, "Funny you should mention it." [laughter] I saw this ad and bless his heart, he said, "Let's go look at it tomorrow." So, I really had no idea what I was getting into, but I knew I was going. The White House wasn't an option anymore. Nuclear energy policy wasn't my passion. And I loved, if it's anybody's, I don't know. [laughter] It must be somebody's. &gt;&gt;audience #9: Actually, I do energy policy here at Google and I used to work in the White House doing energy policy. &gt;&gt;Ina: I'm sorry? &gt;&gt;audience #9: I used to work in the White House doing energy policy-- &gt;&gt;Ina: You're kidding. &gt;&gt;audience #9: and I actually do energy work here at Google. &gt;&gt;Ina: Isn't it great? &gt;&gt;audience 9: But it's my passion. &gt;&gt;Ina: Congratulations. [uproarious laughter] What administration did you work in? &gt;&gt;audience #9: Clinton. &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh my goodness. That's fabulous. So you know exactly how I feel. [Ina laughs] &gt;&gt;audience #9: But I'm not looking to make a career change, just so you know. [laughter] Thank you. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. Congratulations, that's a great career move. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, we have time for just a few more questions. Let's, we got, I think, three here. So, yeah. &gt;&gt;audience #10: Hi, Ina. &gt;&gt;Ina: Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #10: Great to see you here at Google. I am not much of a cook, but my wife is a huge fan. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #10: With the tablet computer set to invade kitchens, could you give us an-- &gt;&gt;Ina: I'm so sorry. Can you speak a little louder? I can't quite hear. &gt;&gt;audience #10: With the tablet computers-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Yes. &gt;&gt;audience #10: set to invade kitchens-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt;audience #10: Hopefully, lots of Google-based tablets. &gt;&gt;Ina: Yes. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: Android tablets to invade kitchens. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #10: Could you give us an artist’s perspective on how you see technology helping us become better cooks? &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I think one of the things about tablets that can actually work is, for example, I have my latest book on an e-book through Amazon and I know it’s a thing that you're carrying with you, so I thought, "Well, how can we make this more appropriate for shopping, say?" So, all the recipes are in the— it's the whole book-- but also every ingredient, you can click on the ingredient and it tells you what a Bosque pear looks like and it tells you how to know whether a Bosque pear is ripe when it's brown or green. Or should it be soft or should it be hard when it's ripe? Or, you go to the olive oil section and it says there are a million olive oils. You just can't imagine what to choose. They are the two that I recommend; one's more inexpensive, one's more expensive. So, it can have a lot of information for you and I think it will go towards when you get to, you can tap on the-- when you're cooking--you can tap on the word "whip" and you'll see what it means if you're really a beginning cook, if you need all that help. If you're not a beginning cook, you just cruise right past it. So, I think it can have a lot of depth that just a plain printed recipe can't do. So, hopefully that's where we're going. &gt;&gt;audience #11: I just wanna say, I absolutely adore you and my kids and I have a ritual every night that we have you on in the background while we're making dinner together. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. I love that you're making dinner with your kids. That's great. &gt;&gt;audience #11: So, they're gonna be thrilled that I [ ]. But I just think you're so warm and loving and you're, it just really comes across. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you. &gt;&gt;audience #11: But my question for you is when I read that Barefoot Contessa was sold, I was really wondering why you didn't buy it back at that point and why you let it go? And where is it now? And I've always been curious about that. &gt;&gt;Ina: About the store? &gt;&gt;audience #11: Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, actually, when I made the decision that it was time to sell the store to the employees, and that I was gonna take it off, it never occurred to me. I thought that era of Barefoot Contessa was over and I was gonna do something else. And then when I started writing books, I said to them, "Well, do you want me to write Barefoot Contessa books? Cause they own the store. Or, should I do Ina Garten books?" And they said, "No, no, no. Please, please, do Barefoot Contessa books." So, as time went on and they decided they wanted to go on, one wanted to have a restaurant and the other one had children or didn't want to work anymore, I actually bought the business back. &gt;&gt;audience #11: Oh, OK. &gt;&gt;Ina: So, I do own Barefoot Contessa. Yeah, so it worked. &gt;&gt;audience #11: Oh, good. Now, where does Jeffrey go? I always wonder, where's he going? &gt;&gt;Ina: Yale. &gt;&gt;audience #11: OK. [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: He was the Dean of the, well, he was a lot of things. He was an investment banker; he was in the Clinton Administration-- &gt;&gt;audience #11: OK. &gt;&gt;Ina: and he was the Dean of the business school at Yale. I know he looks like a crazy person. [laughter] Like all he does is just sit there or go shopping for oranges for me on the show. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #11: Right. &gt;&gt;Ina: But he's really a smart guy. &gt;&gt;audience #11: Well, he always comes back for his roasted chicken on Friday night. &gt;&gt;Ina: Right, that's right. On Monday, he goes to New Haven where he now teaches at Yale, among other things, and then comes back on Friday. That's the roast chicken night. [laughter] &gt;&gt;audience #11: [ ] where does he come from? OK. Thank you. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Ina and Jeffrey are the power couple. In fact, I have lots of emails from Googlers who had gotten their Yale MBAs, including Lazlo Bock, who's-- &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, really? Oh. &gt;&gt;Marissa: our head of HR here. &gt;&gt;Ina: Oh, fabulous. &gt;&gt;Marissa: And so he wanted to come and say hello because he was like, "Oh, I know Ina and Jeffrey." [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: Yeah, Jeffrey has his own rep. I was having dinner one night at a restaurant in East Hampton with Susan Stroman, who is the producer, no, the director and choreographer of "The Producers", among other things, and Mel Brooks and Nathan Lane and Jeffrey and me. And somebody from across the restaurant was coming towards us and Susan Stroman, who we call "Stro" said, "Oh my God. I don't know who she's gonna, who this persons gonna come after. Is it Mel? Oh, he's gonna be thrilled. Is it Nathan? He's gonna be really upset." And the person came right over and said, "Oh my God. Jeffrey Garten." [laughter] So, he has his own base of fans. [laughter] It was like, "Get out of the way, Mel Brooks." [laughter] &gt;&gt;Marissa: OK, so we'll take one more question and then we'll have casual questions after. Yeah? &gt;&gt;audience #12: Hi, Ina. &gt;&gt;Ina: Hi. &gt;&gt;audience #12: I was just wondering if you would ever consider being on Iron Chef, and if you were, who would you battle and what would you want the secret ingredient to be? [laughter] &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I'd definitely pick a non-cook. You know, the truth is, I'm not a restaurant chef. I can make something perfectly delicious if I have enough time to do it, but I admire those guys enormously. You really have to be a line cook and a chef to be able to do those. I mean, if somebody gave me oysters and heavy cream and said, "Make something out of this." I'd have a total meltdown. [laughter] So, I actually cook the way you do. I'm really a home cook. I know how to do it, I've had a little more experience, so it's a little easier, but I'm really not in that category at all. I don't consider, I consider myself a business person who cooks, rather than a chef. &gt;&gt;audience #12: Who would you wanna cook aside, though, if you could have a partner. Who would you choose to be your partner? &gt;&gt;Ina: Well, I love Bobby Flay. I love the way he, I love his energy and I love what he does. So, I'd choose him and then I'd just watch him. [laughter] I'd be around going, "What should I do now?" &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, this has been really, really delightful. I know we have lots of people who want autographs and photos and want a chance to chat with you. &gt;&gt;Ina: I'd love to. &gt;&gt;Marissa: Ina's gonna be here for probably about the next half an hour and then she's gonna get to experience a Google lunch. &gt;&gt;Ina: Yay!! &gt;&gt;Marissa: So, you can see how our chefs cook. And this was really wonderful. &gt;&gt;Ina: Thank you so much for inviting me. Thank you, Marissa. Thank you. [applause]
[Music] years ago some dear friends of mine had their wedding right here in my garden and I thought wouldn't it be fun to invite them back for an anniversary dinner with their two children same time same place next a letter since we did lamb for my friend's wedding I thought wouldn't it be nice to have rack of lamb for their anniversary party the good news is it's an incredibly easy dish to make it's a little expensive but it's really wonderful so I've got two racks of lamb here that I got at the butcher and when I did this I asked them to French it which actually means to scrape the meat off the bone and to leave just a little bit of fat on the outside so it keeps it really moist so for the coating and you've one and a half tablespoons of kosher salt lots of fresh rosemary two tablespoons of chopped rosemary what you do is just peel it off the stem rosemary is really traditional for lamb and actually sews garlic and mustard so I've combined all three of them together and this it gives it lots of flavor I'm just going to chop it coarsely because it's going to really get pureed in the food processor so two tablespoons of fresh rosemary and three cloves of garlic right inside we're just gonna puree this first this girl's minced now the last two ingredients are half a cup of Dijon mustard and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar this gives it a little punch we like punch just provide that together [Music] and that's the coding so this is just gonna sit at room temperature until all the flavorings get into the lamb and then I'm gonna cook it a really high temperature 450 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes until it's gorgeous and juicy and rare it's gonna be so good and how easy was that my friend Miguel has come to help me with a table setting for my anniversary party he usually does things totally over-the-top but somehow in this case I think it's really appropriate oh my girl this looks fantastic no you like it oh you've got little lights in there yeah you know for the wedding need some these trees are blooming we put a regular white tablecloth over the table yeah and we're gonna add a few accents do love this is like it's like a veil exactly no actually Janice's dress was like this it was like a ballerina stew - it had sort of a bodice and there's incredible skirt and it looked just like this she's gonna love it I hope so that's what's not to love it's just gorgeous that's fantastic I bet you you can give it to her when her daughter gets her daughter's three and a half now so what's going on the table well I was thinking that everything should be wide yeah yeah so I want to do flowers on your jugs yeah and I'm gonna use your white tulips what you gave those these are French jelly jars oh I get them at flea markets and then we're having also doll candles and I love the way I love the height of all this fantastic Thank You Miguel all right I'm gonna go do my wedding cake otherwise we're not having dessert and I've gone dinner in my table except for my friend's wedding I made them a carrot cake wedding cake and I thought this time since their children are coming wouldn't it be fun to make carrot cake cupcakes so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to start with two cups of sugar one of the third cups of vegetable oil three eggs and it's just one of Anila good vanilla I'm just gonna whisk that together for a while well I get the other ingredients ready so what I have here in the sifter is two cups of flour two teaspoons of baking soda and one and a half teaspoons of salt I'm going to add two teaspoons of ground cinnamon [Applause] this is a great thing to do for entertaining because you can make the cupcakes in advance and the icing in advance and just assemble them before serving and they'll sift all this together perfect and now with the mixer on low speed I'm just gonna put them into the eggs and oil and vanilla mixture those cinnamon smell so good okay everywhere and now I want to do the wet ingredients it's a pound of carrots grated this is the good-for-you part a cup of raisins and a cup of chopped walnuts and what I'm gonna do is just add like a tablespoon of flour to it and that keeps all of these ingredients from sinking the bottom of the cupcakes and now I'm just going to combine the two mixtures I can really smell the cinnamon it's good put these cupcakes on a tiered cake stand so they look like a wedding cake when they're done okay the batter into the carrots it's a great way to get carrots into your children they won't even know the cupcakes are good for them and then after I bake these I'm gonna slather them with cream cheese frosting how bad can that be okay last thing is into the cupcakes my handy dandy ice cream scoop right into the pan one scoop in each and then I'm gonna bake them at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes and then lower the temperature to 350 for about 30 to 35 minutes until they're perfectly done my friends are coming for an anniversary dinner and what I thought would be really great with the rack of lamb is orzo with roasted vegetables what it is is like roast all these vegetables a very high temperature and they get really sweet and delicious and then mix them with orzo which is a rice shaped pasta lemon vinaigrette feta fresh basil it's gonna be really delicious [Music] yellow pepper you can use anything you want to have orange peppers that's great [Music] and then the last thing is olive oil salt and pepper give it lots of flavor toss it all together and I'm gonna roast this at a high temperature 425 for about 40 minutes until it's brown and crusty it's colorful it's delicious and it's good for you carrot cake cupcake icing this is my kind of recipe butter cream cheese sugar and no cooking so I'm gonna start with half a pound of butter [Music] it's really important that this is room temperature and not just leave it out for a few minutes before but like really over I leave it out overnight the cream cheese and the butter so it's really like squishy 3/4 of a pound of cream cheese also room temperature so it's nice and soft and just cream them together lightly til they're combined and then add a teaspoon of vanilla and then the last thing is powdered sugar I actually like to sieve it cuz then it doesn't have any lumps in it nothing worse than icing with lumps in it with it and then just on a low speed just gonna put it right into the mixer just stir it together last stir with a spatula get rid of this clear the decks and this is the fun part I send the cupcakes the last one took a Heather okay it's really up to you but I like lots of icing I see a carrot cake is basically a vehicle for the icing and they're gonna be gorgeous [Music] I'm Miguel this is so lovely I'm glad you like that the dream in the middle of the orchard I brought to your plates and silverware this is actually great I love the way to the fridge that little bit of green really sets off the white perfectly yes not through white it's not too white it just is not a wedding after all I'm also do the main course there so now I'm gonna do the final assembly on the orzo with roasted vegetables vegetables are all cooked and they're crusty and brown just wonderful all the juices and it goes into the orzo which remembers the pasta that's shaped like rice okay left to get all the juices and the bits of vegetables and in the bowl it's all the flavor next thing I'm gonna do is make a vinaigrette which is space of the really simple lemon vinaigrette it's about a third of a cup of lemon juice it's gotta be fresh an equal amount of olive oil lots of salt really makes a difference in this remember the orzo doesn't have any salt in it at all so you want to make sure that it really has flavor just whisk it together it's a wonderful vinaigrette for like a ruble and Parmesan or just a simple green salad so support overall the orzo and the vegetables just enough so it absorbs it it's really best to do this when the orzo is hot because then it absorbs all that lemon vinaigrette and then I'm gonna add lots of really delicious fresh things like scallions just gonna chop up some scallions I like to use the white and the green parts but both have lots of flavor I like when you can really see it and taste it you know exactly what you're eating so lots of chopped scallions fresh basil leaves it's a really good summary dish it goes with so many things chicken and lamb and fish make it in huge quantities and it lasted my frigerator for days chop basil putting all my favorite things in this you chop the feta I think it's really good with this what I like to do with feta is actually die said I don't like when it's all crumbled up and makes a salad look messy so I'm just gonna dice it carefully and then just put it in he's really good fed it makes a difference lots of feta and toss it all together all the flavors of the basil and scallions and feta and sweet roasted vegetables and the last thing I'm gonna put on is toasted pignoli so what I've done is heat them in a pan in a dry pan until they just browned I'm gonna put them right on top how great is that oh ok looks so good mmm a little more salt the words are really absorbs the salt it's fresh it's good for you it would be wonderful with a rack of lamb for the lamb looks great all the mustard and the rosemary and the garlic have really gotten into the meat it's gonna be wonderful I'm gonna roast it at 450 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes and it's a rare and succulent and delicious so for the anniversary dinner I'm doing for my friends I thought with a rack of lamb and orzo with roasted vegetables be really nice to do it very simple first course of asparagus roasted with Parmesan cheese you know the myth about vegetables is the smaller they are the better they are but I really think asparagus that are thick or have so much more flavor and oddly when you roast them I think they're tenderer than those pencil-thin asparagus okay that's done I was gonna put them on the ship down just drizzle them with olive oil toss them around make sure they're nicely coated lots of salt cracked pepper okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 20 minutes until they're just tender well this lamb looks just gorgeous but just to be sure I always have an instant thermometer to make sure it's exactly the right temperature so I want it to be 125 20 and 30 degrees for it to be rare and it's perfect so let thing we're going to do is just cover it for the woman who foil for about 15 minutes and it steams and it gets really cooked a little bit more and it comes out really juicy and rare but you don't want to let it sit 150 minutes otherwise it'll overcook all right oh my god this is great good I like this it's such a good idea yeah we're not using an under cloth so we can see the grain of the wood we're gonna crack a little bit on top yeah gonna use all the things to keep it even more simply because I'm gonna use this for the cupcakes and I thought I'll tear them with flowers coming down and some ivy and I thought we really look like a wedding cake but since it's for children to find out the couple yards there's more babies please yeah it's much more playful okay what's next champagne cuts okay I can do that last think about is this something Beckett you cannot have an anniversary dinner without something can't do it this looks so fabulous they're gonna be so shocked I can't wait till they get here hope you like it okay got one last thing to do for dinner this is really my kind of simple food Parmesan cheese on the roasted asparagus into the oven for another 60 seconds and I think okay everybody asparagus with parmesan will you do great this is a perfect setting and it's just the best it really is when they have that huge tent and everybody was singing and dancing it was really fun it was wonderful [Laughter] I'm glad I never quite understood what asparagus were because when my mother made him so everything's ready for the main course for my anniversary dinner its rack of lamb and orzo with roasted vegetables and the good news is already this is going to be just so great I love what everything's prepared in advance and all we have to do is put it on the plate so this is the orzo which is the rice shaped pasta and it's got all the wonderful roasted vegetables and scallions and basil and feta and pine nuts can be really good I thought it'd be really nice to do some fresh basil on the top right on top maybe a few leaves just to give it that look so and now the best part the rack of lamb pretty hot this looks perfect oh it smells so good and smell all the mustard and rosemary and garlic oh it's just perfect pink and juicy that's a bone doesn't go easily all you have to do is just wiggle your knife and it'll come out perfectly yeah it looks so good I think this is finger work and I get nice and rare like this this is definitely more than enough for six people but I love people to feel the pain of seconds all right a little garnish since there's rosemary in it I thought a little fresh rosemary and we're ready for dinner [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] now I'm going to transform these cupcakes into a wedding cake it's actually looks more complicated than it is so I just take roses and cut them pretty short and then maybe some flowers or leaf something like that and just put it on the top so a little champagne all ready to go and some candles and we've got an anniversary celebration [Music] with your name [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
[Music] who doesn't love fish and chips I do not the saga can you find in most restaurants what really delicious crisp on the outside tender on the inside since my friend TR has a new Shack it's a fishing shack I thought it'd be very appropriate to make fish and chips form so I'm just going to make the batter and then I'm going to cook the fish there so the first thing I need to tap a cup of flour plus one tablespoon at the tablespoon of baking powder half a teaspoon of lemon zest grated a little pinch of cayenne to give it some heat teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper put a whisk in half a cup of water [Music] sometimes that or sounds like it's really complicated but it's not it's just like making pancakes on Sunday morning to make it ahead and just let it sit in the fridge and add one egg just whisk it in and that's it I'm going to TRS out someone's gets a fish in it and fry it up and then make a baked chips delicious here's doing a fabulous job cutting the fish into one and a half by three inch chunks and I'm going to make a chip which instead of being fried chips are big chips they marinated in an oil with rosemary and garlic the moment keeps him and then roast them at 400 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes until they're nice and brown on one side and I'm going to turn them over and brown them on the other and they can be really crisp on the outside and so I fried them okay I'll do the salt you do the pepper that's perfect so this is only going to take about five minutes to cook on detainers anything about 35 minutes so you want to show me the dot core okay so I've got a half an inch of oil on the pan to fry the fish and it needs to get up to 360 degrees and that way the fish will be really crisp on the outside and tender inside it's going to check it with candy thermometer so let's see if the oils 360 degrees perfect okay now take the fish fillets put them in the batter into this like a pancake batter and then the fish goes right in I'm just going to put enough in so it doesn't get crowded it cook pretty quickly about five minutes total so when it's brown on one side just give it a nice turn it look great so nice and brown that is best fabulous know what you just fixed up there's a crate the big chips of rosemary and garlic and the fish wrap it up and suppose it's a newspaper so the parts in a black paper in the phone and then I'm going to fill it with fish and chips [Music] this looks so great and I'm off to see our with fish and chips tartar sauce and dill pickle
[Music] I'm having some friends for dinner next week and I have a really hectic schedule so what I'm gonna do is make everything today stash it in the freezer and then next week all I have to do is heat it up and have party so when my friends come next week the main course is gonna be lasagna with turkey sausage let's see I think I'm gonna make frozen mango daiquiris to start and then maybe with the lasagna I'm gonna serve a pesto peace out like that would be really good and for dessert frozen berries with white hot chocolate it's so good and then maybe afterwards coffee with some pom yeas that sounds like a good menu so what I have in this pot is I've sautéed some onions and garlic and then broken up some sausage that I got at the store and this is turkey sausage you can get hot you can get sweet but I actually like to combine the two so it's half and half it's got a pound and a half of sausage and it's well cooked in a little bit of olive oil then I'm gonna add tomatoes a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes in puree if you use whole tomatoes you can just put it in the food processor and crush them up yourself and a six ounce can of tomato paste the whole can I'm gonna lots of flavoring some fresh basil just pick off some leaves and chop it up of course it's all gonna cook together anyway I love basil tastes so good with tomato some turkey sausage it doesn't have to be perfect okay so right into the tomato and turkey sausage and then I think some fresh parsley you can use flat leaf parsley like this or you can use curly parsley I think this has a little more flavor but really depends on the parsley right into the pot I think we need salt and pepper 1/2 teaspoons of salt why does this depends on how salty and peppery the sausages so you want to taste it half a teaspoon of pepper and then just stir it up I'm just gonna let this simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes over low heat until all the flavors blend together in the tomato and the basil and the turkey sausage all tastes like one ok now I'm gonna get the cheese's ready I need 15 ounces of ricotta cheese which is usually 1 package and then I'm gonna put lots of flavors in it first thing is goat cheese I know it's unusual in a lasagna but I think it really gives a great flavor so this is a 4 ounce package we've have a 4 and a half ounce package or 5 ounce package just too casual about it just fine just crumble it right up into the ricotta it's sort of a little more punch and kind of flavor it's good 1 cup of grated Parmesan just mix that in and then one egg you know when you're putting an egg into a mixture I always put it into another glass bowl because you never know when you get a bad egg so one egg extra large etic just mix that in and I'm just gonna a little bit of flavor with some chopped parsley that 2 tablespoons and of course salt and pepper you don't need too much because the parmesan is pretty salty quarter of a teaspoon of pepper and now what I'm gonna do is show you how I did the noodles and then I'm gonna layer the whole thing together with mozzarella it's gonna be fabulous what I do with the noodles is instead of boiling them I pour a really really really hot tap water into a bowl and let the noodles soak for about 20 minutes and they soften up just enough to go into the baked lasagna okay now I'm just going to drain it by the time they're drained I'm gonna be ready to layer them [Music] just spread it out along the bottom of the dish mush it around just want to do one layer of pasta [Music] I don't have to be perfect just cut me with it just take about half the mozzarella and layer it on top and then the next layer is this cheese so we're cut about half the cheese I'm risk the ricotta and goat cheese and Parmesan more sausage okay another layer of noodles more mozzarella dressing the cheese it's amazing how fast this builds up I'm just going to cover it in foil and then let it sit for a while then we're freezing for my part in XP then I'm gonna make some communes to go with coffee pommie eyes are made with puff pastry and believe me if you had to make it yourself you would never make pommy ice but fortunately they come frozen in the freezer department of your grocery store so I'll show you what it is it's actually layers of dough and butter and it makes really really flaky cookies what you want to do is defrost it in the refrigerator so it stays really cold so I'm gonna combine two cups of sugar and I know this is gonna sound strange but an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and it really makes a difference in how it tastes so just like a big pinch of salt so I'll take a bit half of the sugar and spread them you can do it on a board on a marble whatever you have just like that so you pulled these guys apart it's folded in three I'm gonna sprinkle the top with sugar just like that stick blowing pin and just lightly roll it out just so the sugar adheres to the pastry okay now what I'm gonna do is just fold it it's kind of like folding a letter I'm gonna fold it like that and then fold it to the middle fold this to the middle and then fold it over itself just like that press it lightly and now I'm just gonna slice it what's great is when they bake they're gonna puff out and they're gonna be all kinds of swirled sort of like elephant ears or pom yeas just like that just slice them about a half an inch thick you can really keep these in the freezer and if you want to bake off one or two with a cup of tea in the afternoon it's not half bad so I'm just going to put these in the plastic bag and then they can be in the freezer until I need to bake them off [Music] push the last batch of pong yes [Music] my friends are coming for dinner at night I've got everything done in the freezer and ready to bake off this is seriously easy entertaining so this is the turkey was on me I made last week I defrosted it overnight in the refrigerator I think that's a better way of defrosting something than at room temperature it doesn't change the texture so much so it's nice and defrosted we put some grated Parmesan cheese on the top just give it extra flavor and Parmesan will melt on the top will be delicious and how easy is this into the oven 400 degrees for about 30 minutes until it's bubbly and hot and delicious [Music] I can't wait for dinner so I've got everything my party either defrosting their frigerator or already set up in the freezer and I think a lot of people put things into their freezer but they never actually take them out I really use it for pantry so I've got vodka coffee ice cream cookies pound cake and for dessert tonight berries that I froze last week in the summer when berries are really delicious and inexpensive I freeze them I spread them out on a sheet pan put them in the freezer and when they're frozen a place in the plastic bag Marikina fairies all year round bet you're wondering what this is it's a frozen mango daiquiri in individual servings for party or there's always that personal emergency okay so here goes first make the sugar syrup heat up a cup of sugar and a cup of water over low heat just until it's dissolved [Music] and then set aside to cool I sliced and peeled one mango pouring the juice of two limes a teaspoon of sugar syrup and stickers a cup of white rum turn on the blender until it's really smooth turn it off and pour four servings into freezer bags I've put these into glasses so it's easier to pour plenty for my party and plenty left over for emergencies so I've got them sealed in a bag and stashed in the freezer and in no time we're in a frozen grown-up Slurpees I bet you're wondering what this is it's pesto and I'm gonna use it on the salad tonight but it's wonderful to have a really quick separate pasta pesto and made this several days ago but it'll last for months and the freezing this is what I call a quick recipe these are really good flavors together quarter of a cup of walnuts a quarter of a cup of cannolis [Music] and none close a chop garlic that's a lot of garlic process it for about 30 seconds until they're all combined with the food processor off add five cups of basil and know it seems like a lot of basil butter we really chopped up a teaspoon of salt teaspoon of pepper turn it on for two cups of olive or the feed tube this is when the sauce was really starts to look good keep going until it's finely pureed okay turn it off and now add the parmesan which gives great flavor and texture according to a court [Music] after the pesto's in the container for a little film of olive oil on the top it'll keep the pesto from turning brown actually to vegetables I think you're just fine using a freezer corn for corn pudding small whole liners is there great look for tonight in a mixie set and these are gonna be great that's one full freezer pesto pea salad then at five times quickly and the secret is frozen peas so I'm gonna take boiling salted water just a lot of salt in it really gives it great flavor Turner for the peas in and this happens really fast so keep an eye on it and while that's happening one of the ingredients is cannolis and they're perfectly fine right out of the container but they just don't have great flavor you'll just go put them in a dry saute pan for a few minutes until they get sort of nice brown and incredibly nutty flavor so let's see how the peas are doing it only takes about a minute or two and I think they're fine into ice water stop the cooking fast I think I can smell the pignoli spoon they smell great I think they know we done just let them rest there so main part of the salad is actually the spinach and it's this really gorgeous little sort of baby spinach leaves I'm a really delicious is great with pesto so into the bowl and then I'm gonna put the peas on top just draining drain them really well you don't want wet peas in your salad doesn't sound too appetizing does it and then I'm gonna put pissed on the top is a pesto from the freezer lots of good pesto really keeps so well in the freezer for months but also in the refrigerator for about a week toast fall together okay last thing is but can you only say toast it look great they're really nutty brown right on top [Music] I'm ready to serve with my turkey lasagna [Music] now comes the good part frozen mango daiquiris and I'm gonna make calm yes and I served after dinner with coffee let me show you what I've done is I've made the daiquiris actually an individual serving so I'm gonna pour three into the blender right into the blender and then just blend it up if it's too frozen and it doesn't go around a little more rum always helps it's my solution to everything more rum that should do it that looks pretty good I think I needed taste [Music] it's so thick and gorgeous that's really good really taste the fresh ripe mango and the lime juice and the rum and it's not too icy it's just really creamy this is gonna be really good but first I want to finish the Pommier so it can happen with coffee so these guys came right out of the freezer they can be baked frozen these are all covered in sugar so they'll be beautiful caramelized while they bake so they're only three of us so I don't think we need that many for a few extras okay that's great so into the oven 450 degrees for about eight minutes and I'm going to turn them half way through so they caramelize on both sides I can't wait so what are we having tonight there might be a turkey lasagna involved good but that's outweighed by dessert which is frozen berries with white hot chocolate oh my god okay while we're on the subject of dessert I have one more thing to do so don't have any fun until I get that okay for dessert I'm gonna do this I've got pound of white chocolate chips this is so easy you won't believe it and a cup of heavy cream nice low-fat dessert and I'm gonna melt them together with a little bit of vanilla cuz I love vanilla flavor he's really good vanilla cuz they're only a few ingredients in this just stir this is really like a chocolate ganache that you'd put on a cake except it's white chocolate you know when you see cake with a very shiny glaze it's the same thing we're just gonna use it for a sauce and I'm gonna turn the heat off just before it's melted I'm just going to sit there and that's gonna stay warm so it's ready for dessert [Music] who wouldn't want that for dinner okay everybody dinner is ready okay a little turkey lasagna it's light as a feather because it came with the turkey sausage how's that true is that cheesy or Y and we have pesto pea salad Frank you wanna do the honors so it's fresh spinach baby spinach pine nuts peas and pesto ina this is so good how did you get the time to do this today no I did it last week actually that's the dirty little secret because I made everything once we can put in the freezer and it tastes absolutely forever never knows something something's free Shirley well and some things don't okay I'll be right back I'm a surprise [Music] frozen tears I remember through the berries that I frozen one layer my putting plastic bag so that don't stick together the raspberries blueberries blackberries whatever you like and now the good stuff white hot chocolate just make sure it's well stirred I'm just going to pour some over each so it's hot and it's called and it's sweet and it's tart and I'd say they're gonna be very happy the lovely hot chocolate melts the berries just enough so they're still really cold but not really frozen how gorgeous is that included is there I like the frozen in the warm chocolate is amazing and the white chocolate is delicious but who or what wouldn't taste good with there's just one thing missing from this what is the second so what are you giving up coffee and palm viennese in the garden how many times I have to say that thank you you know the key is really really time to sugar stop otherwise it has it just it's just sweet it doesn't have any serve like a round flavor yeah it's earth business and I helped my secret is safe with you as long as were invited back [Music]
[Music] why don't we leave turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas the order an eight pound bird it's really not any more difficult than roasting a chicken I've invited my entire office for dinner tonight three incredible women I'm sure they're expecting takeout pizza so first I'm gonna roast a turkey for the lemon and herb butter to go with it I'll make a vegetable tea on Ed with zucchini tomatoes and potatoes and some light as a art I'm popovers who would love that and to finish it off a creme brulee with a really creamy custard and a crispy caramel topping [Music] we always think of Turkey as this monster 25 pound bird that we have for Thanksgiving when I'm having a few friends over I'd love to get maybe an 8 to 10 pound turkey it's really just like roasting a big chicken and then you can have it all year round so I've got fresh thyme from my garden it's just wonderful and I'm gonna make an herb butter with it and it's gonna keep the turkey really moist and flavorful so 1/4 cup butter so here's what you do with time you take a stem hold the end of it and then run your fingers backwards along the stem and the leaves will just come right off I'm just gonna roughly chop it doesn't have to be perfect just a rough chop and that should be about a tablespoon of fresh thyme whoo smells so good we thought maybe a little lemon so I've got butter thyme lemon a little bit of salt to give it more flavor because we use unsalted butter and I'm just gonna mash it all together okay that's all done so I've got my fresh turkey try and get a fresh turkey if you can rather than a frozen one I think they're really much better this one's organic which is even better I'm just gonna run my fingers right underneath the skin it's a messy job but it's really worth doing just be sure you don't break the skin okay great one side and then the other side okay ready for the butter so I'll show you I'm gonna do I'm gonna take the butter and just take a glob of it and put it right under the skin and then because it's room temperature you can sort of smush it around it's a cold wet job now okay one more big blob on the other side and just push it around underneath the skin you can actually see the lemon and you can see the time underneath the skin and then I'm just going to take the rest of it and just base the outside so when the turkey cooks the skins gonna get nice and brown and the herb butter flavors the skin it flavors the turkey it's gonna be so good okay I'm just gonna wash up before I finish it [Music] so now I'm gonna give the turkey even more flavor when they do is take the rest of this lemon cut it in quarters and just put it right in the middle of the turkey that's gonna make them meat even more flavorful let's see I think I'll do an onion just cut the ends off cut it in quarters and just put it in the middle anything to give it more flavor and then I have some garlic I'm just gonna take the garlic watch this just cut it straight across be careful keep your fingers out of the way and just mmm that's gonna be good in the turkey right there okay so now I'm gonna trust it up the thing about trusting is just to make sure that everything's tight together if there's a leg flapping out there it's gonna burn so you want to make sure that it's everything's all tight to the body of the bird so I'm going to tie up the legs and then pull its little tail so it'll took us it just want to tie the wing so it's tight to the body of the turkey the simpler it is the easier it's gonna be to get the string off when you're done so I know everybody thinks the turkey cooks all day but eight to ten pound bird 350 degrees don't cook in two hours I mean a chicken cooks in an hour and a half so this is gonna be really good creme brulee is the ultimate guide dessert make it and I'll follow you anywhere but tonight I'm making it for my girlfriend's creme brulee is this incredible creamy custard with a hard caramelized top absolutely delicious so three cups of cream I can't make creme brulee with that crap and I'm gonna scald it which means it's not gonna boil but they're gonna be little bubbles all the way around the outside and it's just under boiling so I need one whole egg into the mixer fitted with a paddle attachment which is what this is and I need four egg yolks [Music] half a cup of sugar I'm just going to turn the mixer on low and mix them just until they're combined you don't want to need frothy whippy stuff just until they're combined just like that and then I'm gonna add the scalded milk so I'm just gonna pour it really slowly into the eggs don't want scrambled eggs beginning to look like creme really just looks like a great custard so I'm just gonna flavor it with two things vanilla 1 teaspoon my love good vanilla my favorite and one tablespoon of Grand Marnier she's really orange flavored liqueur but would ever kind of look her you have around the house don't buy a whole bottle just for one tablespoon perfect then I put it into five ramekins or for my friends and I one extra for Jeffrey when he comes home it's the guy dessert thing [Music] a water bath will ensure that the custards cook evenly pitcher really helps so just bet halfway up the sides of the dishes so into the oven 300 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and then I'm gonna chill the custard and my friends and I are going to blowtorch the caramelized sugar together that's gonna be fun I'm off to get vegetables for the vegetable T on to go with the roast turkey love Jim pikes the best box down man [Music] [Music] vegetable TM I need three vegetables zucchini tomatoes and potatoes and the key is I need them all the same circumference so when I slice them they'll line up perfectly [Music] this punch mate is a perfect just the right circumference we need blossom [Music] potatoes these the red ones and I think I like the white ones and I want potatoes that have same diameter is the zucchini like this I have this vegetable tea on the first time and a friend's house in Provence first I'm gonna start with some onions I'm just gonna cook them for about 8 to 10 minutes until they're sort of starting to brown they're really soft and then I'm gonna add some garlic to it cook it for one more minute mmm I can already smell the garlic then I'm gonna turn off the heat and put the onions right into the bottom of the pan so it's gonna flavor all the vegetables on the top and now I'm gonna layer three vegetables on top so tomato potato zucchini and they can sort of stand up a little bit so it's got some thickness but only one layer so tomato potato zucchini and just keep going all the way around tomato potato zucchini see how important it is that the diameter of each of the vegetables is the same so it really looks gorgeous so that's it so I'm just gonna flavor it with some fresh thyme on the top just sort of sprinkle it around the top got a tablespoon and just so you know there's time on the top I love a few sprigs on the top salt and pepper generously because there are a lot of vegetables in here okay just a drizzle of olive oil and it helps the vegetables cook and the potatoes and the tomatoes and the zucchini all cook together which is just great crank this up to 375 together so I'm gonna bake it for 35 to 40 minutes gonna be tender and delicious I never feel like I'm ready for a party until I have the table set I kind of like having the dress ready pick some hydrangeas would be gorgeous so the place you want to actually cut the hydrangea it's right above where the smooth growth forms cut it just like that and then the new buds will form next year I think this one might be nice too right above that bud that's a good stock so there's three secrets to hydrangeas lasting a long time very hot water I cut right down the middle of the stem so it can drink as much water as possible and then take a knife and just run it down the outside of the edge and that'll help the hydrangea drink lots of water right into the water [Music] just a shock of color always makes it a little special and we're having turkey and vegetable tea on and pop over so pretty simple place setting of a fork a knife a spoon for dessert make sure everything's straight I think that's done oh I'm nice and hot okay half cups now take these sprigs of thyme off nobody needs to eat a stem put some grated Gruyere on the top and this is gonna hold it all together the starch and the potatoes is gonna hold it together but also that a little bit of Gruyere melted into it back into the oven uncovered for about 30 minutes until it all cooks together and it's perfectly tender and it's going to be really delicious little browned on the top with the cheese okay let's see how these creme brulees are I wanted to take them out when they're just set and they're perfect right now I just take them out really carefully [Music] perfect so it's gonna be the cold creamy custard and that hard crust of burnt sugar to be really good [Music] turkey smells like it's done two hours it's amazing isn't it smells looks fabulous so there's all kinds of ways to test whether the turkeys done the first one is to sort of shake its leg like shaking hands and if it moves a little bit it should be done everybody uses a thermometer but with the turkey I never know where to put it it's like 170 in one place 1:30 and another I think the easiest thing is just a little knife right between the leg and the thigh and if the juices run clear and they do it's done you actually want to put it under aluminum foil for about 20 minutes and let it rest really makes a difference in terms of how moist and juicy the turkey is I mean really good that's gonna be great with the tea on which I think I'll serve at room temperature okay the next thing is time popovers and what I've done is grease these popover parents are specifically used for popovers and I'm gonna preheat them for about two minutes in 425 degree oven okay popovers it's really like a pancake batter it's really easy to make and I've wanted to have cups of flour remember fluff it up and then just level it off and a half okay next is a little bit of salt 3/4 teaspoon of salt 3 eggs 1 everything room temperature make that a popovers always crack eggs into another Bowl just in case you get a bad egg you don't have to start all over again okay right in the middle make a little well three eggs why don't have cups of milk and just whisk this all together and then one and a half tablespoons of melted butter seems to be butter and everything doesn't it you don't want to too hot so you don't cook the eggs just a little bit perfect and I did this in a picture so it's easy to pour into the pans and then it's a little bit of fresh thyme like a tablespoon I've tried lots of different flavorings for popovers because I love them parmesan a little rosemary but the time is the one I like the best here okay right in last whisk really hot pans don't fill them more than half-full okay into the oven 425 degrees for exactly 30 minutes and remember no peeking [Music] so the trick is the resting for about 20 minutes and time to cargo [Music] [Music] [Music] that's pretty good so shall I have you have it a little turkey the herb and lemon and thyme butter [Music] little TM I love so which is might have a little career zucchini the only place okay I'm a little T on darling definitely cheesy and now the best part love a time pop over thank you Susannah loving Thank You Ashley so what was the last time you had Turkey what wasn't Thanksgiving it's really I think it's great yeah it's like making a big roast chicken know what's for dessert hmm it's a surprise and you have to make it yourself come with me [Music] boy have I got a treat for you they're vanilla custard but they might have a little Grand Marnier in it how about if we brulee the top so burnt sugar I'll show you how all right so I'm going to take a tablespoon of sugar and just put it right on the top of a cold custard and actually if you take your finger and run it along the top like that just to smooth it out so you get it all the way and this is the fun part so this is a little kitchen torch so you turn it on watch that that's tan am i that dangerous okay one nice and high to keep your hand away and you just hold it right down on the sugar and it'll burn it you don't have to put a blowtorch you can actually do it in the boiler but I just think it comes out much better this way and it's so much more fun and then you just let it chill for a minute and it hardens color like a hard caramel so that's what's it per second is gonna get really hard all right Shanae you're next good job is Ryan she's a pro if you think this looks like fun it is okay that's dessert excellent well done everybody cheers everyone Oh I love the contrast in texture who's the extra one Brian all I thought I might run for charity if it lasted [Music] bet that creme brulee Jeffrey will never know
[Music] I love entertaining on the beach so when my friends Joey and Maureen told me it was their dog Theo's birthday I thought what a great excuse for a party so I've invited lots of friends with their dogs to meet me at the beach the four-legged ones are gonna get these amazing treats and the humans what else hot dogs on the grill well not really hot dogs but grilled sausages in Funds piled high with sauteed onions and peppers plus a classic potato salad well with the volume turned up and what better to serve for drinks at the beach but sea breezes and for dessert a fabulous sheet cake with chocolate frosting and decorated with adorable dog cookies why no the dogs are going to have fun at the beach and with all that good food I bet the humans won't have a bad time either [Music] so we're off to the beach with the dogs and since we're having hot dogs or chicken sausages I thought what would be more perfect with it then really good potato salad so the potatoes are done I'm just gonna drain them so I cook them for about ten minutes and then I let them steam for another ten minutes so that's three pounds of new potatoes it's a small ones you can use red ones or white ones whichever you like and I'm just going to let them steam and the steam really gets into the potatoes and cooks them beautifully so next I'm gonna make the sauce so one cup of mayonnaise quarter of a cup of buttermilk or white wine or chicken stock whatever you have just whisk it together until it's creamy so having some kind of liquid to mayonnaise takes away that sort of gloppy flavor and it makes it more like a sauce now I'm gonna add lots of flavor two tablespoons of Dijon mustard two tablespoons of coarse mustard it's this grainy mustard really has great flavor and it also looks like mustard so you know exactly what's in it and then lots of fresh dill about a half a cup of chopped fresh dill if you don't like tell you can always use parsley or something like that but I really like doing this it gives it lots of flavor so just chop off the leaves chopped it up roughly mmm smells like summer to me and that should be about a half a cup teaspoon of salt teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna whisk this all together and I've got the sauce actually I'm a summer you can make a huge amount of this if you're having a potato salad a lot and then just use it as you make the potatoes don't leave it in the fridge okay potatoes should be ready so it's gonna clean up a little bit and see how they are perfect and they look beautiful so I'm gonna cut up the potatoes and just gonna quarter these guys if they're really big you can cut them in smaller pieces but quarters are just about right I used small round potatoes so you use the skins they're very thin-skinned and actually the skins have a lot of nutrition in them so it's really worth keeping I also love the way it looks I think it's much easier looking it's gonna be great I'm gonna pack it and Chinese containers and everybody have their own little potato salad at the beach okay that's it for the potatoes so I'm gonna let them cool a little bit well I chopped up some celery and red onion for it one of the things that's really important for me when I'm making salads it's not just the flavor and the color but also the texture and with this salads really nice to have a little bit of a crunch with the celery and red onions so I need might be about a half a cup of celery and red onion in this just nice rough chop remember this is a homemade salad it's supposed to look like a homemade salad don't obsess about having perfect sized pieces that's crazy [Music] when you're cutting red onion leave the back part attached keep your fingers out of the way just do slices like that and then straight down really let the blade do the work by moving rather than pushing it move the blade half a cup of red onion that's gonna give a nice flavor okay I think the potatoes are cool enough so I'm gonna put the dressing on toss it all together this is great salad cuz if it sits a little bit really absorbs into the flavor of the potatoes mmm this looks good and then tossing all the red onion and celery give it lots of crunch and flavor Oh looks really good I'm actually not gonna check it for seasonings right now because it's warm and it's gonna be served cold it's better to check the seasonings when it's the temperature you're gonna eat it so I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator and pack it up later and take it to the beach and now I'm off to the beach to find the perfect spot for the party [Music] hi Joey how's the birthday boy he is so excited about this party Mandy I'm just looking around to see what we should set up I thought somewhere maybe down by the water in front of the pavilion how does that sound to you sounds fabulous okay will you call everybody it's on the word to me I'll bring all the food and the cocktails we're having hot dogs very funny ina the dogs will never get the joke [Music] I don't know who's gonna have more fun at this party the people are the pooches so I'm gonna make the grilled sausage the hot dogs and of course we can do mustard and ketchup and all those things but I thought be so much better to have sauteed onions and peppers to put on them so I'm gonna make a big pot of it bring it to the beach and then heat it up on the grill so I need lots of onions I'm using Spanish onions those big ones that you can find in the store just big half rounds of Spanish onions I've got oil heating up in the pan and then I'm just gonna put this big pile of onions in it's about 10 cups of onions okay I'm just gonna let those cook for about 15 to 20 minutes until they're browned and sweet and Cara moss and they'll be reduced millionaire's peppers and flavorings while that's cooking I'm gonna get the other things ready so it's to red peppers it's good idea to keep an eye on the onions where they're starting to brown they look great okay that's two yellow peppers and the onions it's the whole house not great I'm gonna make some garlic and then this would be done just stick with the garlic right in the pan I don't cook garlic very long just for 3060 seconds these onions look amazing they're browned and caramelized and the bottom of the pan is all crusty and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take some sherry vinegar and deglaze the pan it'll get all that great flavor I think about a quarter of a cup of sherry vinegar that's gonna get up all that brown scrapings on the bottom sherry woman vinegar and the onions are fabulous together okay now all the peppers go in [Music] I'm gonna add some tomato paste think that tablespoon should be good and some crushed red pepper flakes I don't like things too spicy so I'm just gonna add about a half a teaspoon so I'll start with a teaspoon and see how it goes and pepper 1/2 a teaspoon okay I'm just gonna let this simmer Wayne until it gets reduced and sweet and delicious it's gonna be so good with the chicken sausages now for the main event the birthday cake not for the dogs for the people [Music] I need two hundred quarter sticks of butter I need three cups of sugar and while they're creaming I'm gonna get the rest of the ingredients together [Music] okay the butter and sugar really well creamed they're light and fluffy gets really a light yellow color just gonna scrape down the bowl to make sure it's not sticking to the bottom okay and then with a mixer on low when I add the eggs one at a time just make sure they get really well incorporated it's gonna make a huge cake whatever reason he gets them to take home next the zest of one lemon it's a right cake but there's a little bit of lemon really gives it lots of flavor one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla [Applause] and what type of sour cream this one keeps it really moist it's an 8 ounce container hmm it's already smells good okay now for the dry ingredients first thing is three cups of flour any all-purpose flour I use unbleached flour whatever you have cornstarch third of a cup this basically approximates cake flour makes it nice and light teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of salt just set that all together okay I'm very low speed I'm just going to add the dry ingredients to the wet ones and mix it just until it's blended make sure it's really well mixed mmm can really smell the lemon and I just think makes us such a difference because it a very fresh flavor without being lemony so this is a half sheet pan is 12 by 18 and about one and a quarter inches deep it's gonna get them in any cookware stores just pour the batter in this is a really useful batter I make cupcakes out of them I make small cakes out of it sometimes I've flavored a little bit with orange and lemon just spread it out evenly and then later I'm gonna just cover the whole thing with the most gorgeous chocolate frosting and you won't believe the decorations I found for them nice and smooth into the oven 25 to 30 minutes 350 degrees and it's going to be a knockout cake [Music] so for my pooch party the dogs are gonna have dog biscuits and water but the humans are having chicken sausage potato salad and birthday cake for dessert so I'm gonna do a chocolate icing for my white cake first thing I need is 24 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips mmm already smells good why don't have cups of heavy cream and just let the chocolate melt over double boiler simmering water I don't want it to get too hot because otherwise the chocolate will separate not pretty I just chopped the chips but if you want to use bars of chocolate that's fine to just make sweet chocolate actually the more you stir it the shinier it gets it makes a really nice frosting okay so off the heat I'm gonna add two tablespoons of corn syrup actually keeps the frosting spreadable Florida 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla actually gonna check it off the double boiler so it goes down pretty fast because I'm gonna have to let it cool a little bit before I add the butter make the buttercream so I'm just gonna stir that in and now wait do you see what I have to decorate this cake with so I was trying to think how am I gonna decorate a cake for humans that's a dog party and I found these amazing cookies wait do you see them they just admit I love them it's a little fire hydrant and they're great dogs and so I'm going to decorate the cake with them just so the dogs don't feel left out I've got wonderful things for the dogs to cook these they look like cookies and they really don't biscuits okay time to ice the cake so I have the cool chocolate it's really nice and thick just wonderful I'm gonna pour it into the mixer that's a lot of chocolate but it's a lot of cake too it's always so dramatic to have a huge cake and it's not that expensive a half a stick of room-temperature butter I'm just gonna beat this together until it's light and fluffy and it's a nice buttercream okay that should do it nice and thick oh it's gorgeous now I'm spread it on the cake you want to be sure the cake is nice and cool when you do this otherwise you let me talk like a mess [Music] okay just spread it out evenly this is a great frosting for cupcakes and for chocolate cakes but I just thought in this case a nice white sheet cake would be really fun perfect except to make sure the icing is good so chocolatey it's just delicious okay now we're gonna decorate this well we have to start with a fire hydrant right right there and I think the dogs are gonna be all lined up don't you this is so great okay and what I think this guy is pretty cute that's gonna go right there and I love him that's my courage right there I think we might have a cat in there little cat in the middle and a little black one little guy and right there okay how great does that look I'd say that's a treat for the humans and I've got treats for the dogs everybody's gonna be happy now I'm gonna pack everything up and I'm off to the beach [Music] I say they're having a good time so am i I'm making chicken sausages on the grill I just thought they'd be really flavorful he's sort of like having hot dogs but not and then I'm gonna have a sauteed onions and red peppers to top them off it's gonna be really good dinner this is good enough to eat so it was a challenge growing on the beach but I'm always surprised how great it feels when it comes out right and what I have here is I have the sauteed peppers and onions and I'm heating up on this other grill and they're heating up really fast oh they look great it's really really good on the sausages [Music] sea breezes are really easy it's two parts cranberry juice1 part grapefruit juice and one part vodka that's the good part [Music] shake it up and serve it with some line kind of warned my buds and I'm not kidding dinner's ready okay everybody dinner's ready come on over it went straight for the main course chicken sausage really mess that you think it's chicken sausage with peppers and onions ambulance chicken sausage and sausage to live who need to explain why you've got the better themselves sausage excellent with peppers and they're like okay [Music] yeah you know that's the old fashioned American potato salad decade nothing who wants birthday cake you can use it's right here your get the hydrant right okay take anymore [Music] I'm gonna be celebrating Gio's birthday every year [Applause] [Applause] [Music]
it's my friend Stevens birthday and I've given him a cooking class for a present so he's gonna come over and we're gonna cook together and then some friends are coming for dinner it's gonna be really fun coconut cupcakes are one of Stephens favorite desserts I'm gonna make them for his birthday so 3/4 a pound of butter and two cups of sugar think about baking that's really important is it should be exact really measure things carefully when you're cooking you just throw things in taste and see how it is but with baking you really don't know if it's good or not until you've taken it out of the oven and it's done so want to be sure that the measurements are exact don't rush this step it's a really important part of baking the next step is the eggs and this recipe calls for five eggs three four and five eggs so later on I'm gonna show seeking how to make Indonesian chicken roasted carrots and buzz mati rice and it's a really easy dinner that he can make for his friends maybe even me okay so the next ingredients are vanilla extract and almond extract so one and a half teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and one and a half teaspoons of pure on the Dex tract and now I'm going to put together my dry mixture and a wet mixture that are gonna go in alternately I'll show you so I need about three cups of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking powder half a teaspoon of baking soda and half a teaspoon of kosher salt so now I'm gonna sift these together which is actually gonna not only sift the flour and dry ingredients but it's gonna combine them and the next thing is buttermilk I have 1 cup of buttermilk I'm gonna turn the mixer on very low speed and I want to add a quarter of the flour until it's just mixed in remember when start doing the flour you don't want to over mix it a third of the liquid ingredients another portion of flour until it's just mixed in another portion of liquid ingredients this is going to make a really moist delicious coconut cupcake it's all part of the fun of it at the end of with flour all over you and mix it just until it's done so in fact I'll usually save the last mix for my spatula and then the last ingredient is coconut so it's seven ounces of coconut that goes right in you can actually do it on the mixer I like to do it by hand and it's just perfect and then we're gonna add more coconut to the top with the icing mmm Stephens gonna be very happy this is my secret for making coconut cupcakes every single one is exactly the same size ice cream scoop just a regular a standard ice cream scoop and you fill it up so it's sort of overflowing like that and then you drop one in each and they're gonna rise a little bit but not so much so that's exactly the size you want them I think maybe I might have to put candles in each one for Stephen it's really fun to make cupcakes for instead of a birthday cake and then everybody gets their own little cupcake so they're gonna go in the oven 325 for about 25 minutes until they're done and then I'm gonna ice them mmm parse it from my roasted calf all these green hydrangeas are you perfect for the table gorgeous so the cupcakes are in the oven and I'm about to make that icing love that icing confectioner sugar so the first thing is cream cheese and butter it's really important like really important that they be room temperature otherwise the butter ends up in little bits all through the icing not good so that's a pound of cream cheese and 3/4 of a pound of butter I don't want to whip this I just want to mix it until it's just combined and with my just just scrape down sides 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract the good kind and half a teaspoon of almond extract these are the two flavorings in the coconut cupcakes so really has the same kind of flavoring just combine it like that and now the last ingredient how easy is this is one and a half pounds of confectioner sugar so right after this I'm gonna go shopping for all the ingredients for my dinner with my friend Steven it's his birthday dinner be fun still sifting now show you what I want to do on a very low speed I'm gonna very slowly I had the confectioner sugar to the cream cheese butter and flavorings and that's it so we'll leave this here and I'll see how the coconut cupcakes are doing oh they look perfect I feel done I use a skewer like a bamboo skewer but you can use a toothpick just to put it right in the middle of the coconut cupcake and if it comes out clean and it does it's perfect my friend Stephens birthday today and I'm giving in to a cooking class as a gift he's not gonna believe how easy my Indonesian ginger chicken is to make oh look at these guys they're so sweet their little baby beads but I'm looking for carrots today so I'm gonna stay focused now I need some ginger don't be afraid of it it's wonderful and it has no smell at all but when you cut into it'll be really pungent so what's gonna make the Indonesian it's actually a great recipe it's really easy so I know you can make it for everybody mm-hmm including me maybe actually your breath always ruins to make chicken so it has four ingredients first one is honey into the pan okay Hunter fect just beautifully okay and the next thing I have I need 3/4 of a cup of soy sauce so which is great because actually it's the salt so it's the sweet and the salt you want to put that right in the pot mm-hmm be sure to get it all over my white shirt that's part of the experience okay the next ingredients ginger I won't just want to grade it on this box grad you want to keep your fingers out of the way so I'll peel something for you how's that and then you can grade it and then I'm gonna do the garlic you haven't said anything about desert well then a lot of talk about chicken what chicken here's more ginger well let's see I think Stephen I think what's your favorite cake Wow what's your favorite dessert does it start with cocoa and end with nut that would be it I made coconut cupcakes for your birthday yeah okay so I'm gonna do the garlic so now in that pot for the marinade we've got honey soy sauce we're gonna have your ginger and we're gonna have my garlic and we're gonna let it sit in that for a little while so this is not like a first date dinner it's definitely not a first date dinner now can I stop greeting sugar I need a half a cup let's take this is thought to be a half I need two of those in that pot with the soy sauce and with the funny you're on it they're going in okay doesn't have to be exact just throw it all in that is the kind of recipe monix my we're very casual ah there we go can I move into your space in your cutting and chopping space please our space our space it's okay so I'm going to chop this up I need a quarter of a cup so this is the entire marinade and we're gonna put the chicken into this and just let it sit and maybe four I mean we're hungry so maybe for an hour but mm-hmm if you want to leave it overnight we're hungry and thirsty outside we'll drink for the hour while we let it marinate that's about a quart of cover I'd say that's it so what we're gonna do is heat this up until the honey melts I'm gonna pour it over the chicken and let it sit for about an hour or if you have the time let it sit overnight in the refrigerator and then it's really good and that's when we're gonna release one oh yeah I think that's exactly the hour we're gonna be drinking it so just until that until you feel that the honey is melted this is pretty liquid that's exactly--it then I think it's done I'm gonna put it in a roasting pan the good news is we're gonna marinate it in the roasting pan then we're going to bake it in the roasting pan so you don't even have to change pans I think just want to pour that marinade right over to me that smells so good doesn't it women when the garlic and the ginger heat up you can really smell it and the honey mmm so I'm gonna cover this with foil and I'm gonna let it marinate for about an hour and as I said you could let it marinate for an hour or overnight if you want to this could be pretty good you could do this okay in the fridge okay let's clean up so I put these in to just review the dishwasher guys okay fabulous you know about God's and dish 1,000 dishwashers I don't know guys idea of doing the dishes is putting them in the sink so after this you know we're gonna do I'm gonna show you how to ice a cupcake oh that's a good skill huh have you ever done it no I remember I memorized the cake oh all right so here are the cupcakes these are the three options I have for ice and choose your weapon I like like that I used to speckle it's sort of the same skill actually it's good Oh doesn't this look fabulous all that cream cheese and vanilla and um and don't we have to taste it make sure it's okay that's good that's perfect great right there should I do one okay and you're like okay so you want lots of icing on top cuz it's the yummy part of this so I think I'm just putting on the stand like that so you're next here we go not enough okay no does the icing um harden a little bit it actually stays pretty crewmates it's a little bit it'll be a little firmer but it stays really creamy okay and the last one goes there and then the final touch is coconut so I'm gonna start and then you're gonna keep going lots of coconut right on the top how we gonna stand from eating them before the party more coconut never too much coconut so let's see how this ginger chicken is doing almost not to cook it oh yeah it's time to cook it but I can even smell it even with the foil on it uh doesn't that look fabulous oh you can smell it when you take it off the ginger and the honey in the mmm and the garlic already all right I'm gonna put the foil on we're gonna put it in the oven for about half an hour at 350 degrees and then we're gonna take the foil off turn the chicken and it's gonna get nice and brown and the juices will become the sauce I think it'd be very happy perfect we should cook together more often I like this so you're always so nice about my table settings want me to show you how I do it so you're gonna know the secrets now but it's sort of like that Paris Bistro thing where there are two layers of call so one goes on a diagonal and then the good cloth goes on top where'd you get this oh we've got a little place in forest so I save it for very special occasions perfect you're in charge of Soph where you said your knifes pacing in or out facing in great so since green is our color we did this flower arrangement out of green hydrangeas it's wonderful and our wine glasses give our place settings a little height so we're ready for your birthday so roasted carrots forget what you used to have when you were a kid they were all mushy yeah I hate them these are cryptid a really high temperature and they're gonna be really caramelized on the outside and they're gonna be just tender and sweet on the inside you know it's hard to remember a flavor so what I do is I line things up this is I think you'll think this is interesting so I've got four different kinds of salt kosher salt which I usually use I'm gonna put I'm gonna line them up and then we're gonna taste them all you see what incredible difference it is so the first one is table salt the usual kind that you have on the table the second one is kosher salt which we use a lot the third one is sea salt infected flaked sea salt so it's really interesting sees totally different texture and the fourth one is another kind of sea salt called fleur de sel is it fresh it's fresh that's called fleur de sel touch your tongue to your finger and just put it right in the salt it's salty it's wrong um I think it has a harshness like a bitterness about it doesn't it mm-hmm and then the second one is kosher salt house that is different to you Wilder it's milder it's softer I think it has a more round than the third one does the sea salt that went to me is softer it's more it's closer to the kosher salt but it's got a softer flavor and it sort of melts in your mouth doesn't has almost sweeter it's sweeter that's exactly right the last ones fleur de sel and it's actually if you can find it it's um I use it for finishing because it actually is so soft to me that just his briny sort of like the ocean doesn't it it's very soft and it's it's really kind of sweet isn't it oh you're right isn't that interesting it's very delicate it is like the ocean and that's where it comes from it's harvested from the ocean so now you'll always remember about the different kinds of salt which one do you want to use for the UM carrots sea salt sea salt you got it great so the next thing we're gonna do is cut these guys up so you want to take the top off and then just a little bit of the base you don't wanna cut too much off I just do big chunks like this really big really big what happens is in the oven they tend to shrink a little bit so you want to be sure to cut them really big and chunky good done okay next things roasting pan you know you can do this in a bowl but I just don't rent on the pan carrots go on the sheet pan so the next thing we're gonna need is olive oil which is right there when you drizzle olive oil you want to cover the top with your finger just a little bit so that you're you don't dump yeah you know dump the entire bottle on the olive oil actually when it gets hot it really roasts the carrots so it's important to have some olive oil and all the carrots okay now we need salt choose your salt sea sea salt okay with flake sea salt I'm a prepper great thank you sounds good graded on the top and how simple go out couldn't be easier good amazing right and it really can do it so many vegetables okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and we'll take a look at them and as long as we're here I think the chicken might be ready to return thank you oh my god that smells so good so I'm just gonna turn this so that when it cooks the skin gets really Brown and just delicious and now all the juices from the chicken and ginger and garlic and the honey are gonna make a wonderful sauce okay so now without the foil so if it gets nice and brown I'm gonna put it back in the oven I know where I am I'm turning up the oven to 375 a little higher temperature goes back in the oven for about half an hour and that carrots and the chicken will be ready at the same time pretty out here tonight isn't it I believe the cooking lesson was her birthday gift she's such a great teacher she makes everything look so easy doesn't that look great this is the Indonesian ginger chicken and it's just I can smell all the garlic and the ginger and the honey and it's just it's gorgeous it was perfectly cooked you know the hardest thing about a meal is getting everything done at the same time and the good news is all of us can stay warm in the oven for a little while until everything's done together hmm I love that it actually makes its own sauce too as you don't have to make a separate thing for a sauce the great thing about cooking it covered is it gets nice and cooked but then when you take the foil off I get so nice and brown I love the way that looks I've got lots of sauce you'd see all the ginger and garlic in it it's all cooked you know the garlic was a lot of garlic but in fact when it cooks like this it gets really sweet so it's wonderful next is the roasted carrots which I roasted for about a half an hour to high temperature about 400 degrees and they're just perfectly cooked they came in a little parsley up that's special parsley to my garden I love these carrots because they're so sweet when you roast them like this made a little fuzz body rice and I cut up a few scallions I thought that'd be good in it maybe a little parsley why not please eat going out to the party let's start dancing fun I can smell the ginger and the garlic in the chicken see it's not so garlic its place fairly famous rustle - laughs car please all right let's try this see if we really know what we're doing yet what do you think chef Drucker I think this is a very successful birthday all right they know who they are steve is great these are both right now
[Music] when my husband Jeffrey comes on for the weekend I try and make lots of things in advance so I can spend time with him instead of spending time in the kitchen but I hate to cook for two so I'm gonna call my friend TR pest gun and tell them I'm cooking for four and he'll have dinner for the weekend - hey what are friends for I'm making individual chicken pot pies that are perfect for a simple dinner but good enough for company plus a healthy wheat berry salad that can sit in the refrigerator to be served any time and split pea soup that can be an appetizer with dinner or Sunday lunch in front of the fireplace plus I'm gonna give TR a list of things to buy for the weekend otherwise you know how men are you'll end up with four chocolate cakes and nothing else to eat well the most popular south we ever made up there for Contessa is wheat berry salad so the first thing I did was cook wheat berries it's the kernel of the wheat and I cooked it for 45 minutes until it was just tender I'm just gonna drain them this salad was actually first made for me by Brent Newsome was a wonderful caterer in East Hampton and an absolute doll too so put these in the bowl and then I'm gonna add lots of things that have lots of flavor first thing is gonna saute some red onions use red onions cuz it's a little sweeter than white onions 2 tablespoons of olive oil heat up the olive oil a little bit and I had 1 cup of finely chopped onion red onion we're gonna cook these for a few minutes until they're tender not until they Brown in the meantime we'll do a little dressing for the wheat berry salad so I need 4 tablespoons of olive oil which is also a quarter of a cup it's great to do the dressing while they're warm because it really absorbs into the wheat berries and 2 tablespoons or half 1/4 of a cup of good balsamic vinegar salt and pepper check my onions what am I'm like a medium-low flame really smelling I'm gonna be great in the wheat berries and then three scallions all kinds of good chopped vegetables whatever you want to do I mean this is really salads are great because you can just make it up as you go along three scallions I use the white and the green parts they both have lots of flavor the Greens perfectly delicious and it gives it a lot of color too I love making this for a weekend because you can just sit in the refrigerator and whenever I need a quick salad or a lunch it's ready the flavors just get better and better as the vegetables and the scallions and the onions all sit together perfect okay I need to go right into the wheat berries toss it together you can see how one that weak berries and the onions are warm really absorbs into the middle of the wheat berry okay three chopped scallions right into the salad get your eyes but it's good half a red pepper I mean if you have a yellow pepper run you can use that too but half a red peppers classic this is one of those great salads you're gonna anything you like if you find something in the refrigerator that looks like it would be good and it just chop it up and try it it's nice to dice this neatly so you get really nice squares of pepper keep your fingers out of the way okay red pepper and some carrot it's not just a healthy salad it's a really satisfying one all the crunchiness and the wheat berries have sort of a nutty flavor and vegetables and the balsamic vinegar is sweet and tart okay in goes the carrot I'm just going to let this sit and marinate let the balsamic vinaigrette get into the wheat berries and the vegetables let's see if this got everything it needs I'm it's just delicious I know why it was one of our most popular salads okay I'm just gonna sit here and I think I'll check in with TR see what he's up to hello hey are you ready for your assignment ready and good to go shopping I do first you're gonna need all kinds of slice cold meats you know like some salami some Italian prosciutto you can pick something else too like a hammer sliced turkey okay cool and then a really decadent dessert because at the end of the day that's all anybody ever remembers well you know me I'm all for decadence and then you'll need some salads I'm not like some heirloom tomatoes or some critters on the vine maybe some salad greens little baby salad greens great thanks for the shopping list mom very funny okay you've got your assignment good luck great I'll see you later bye I love to make chicken pot pies on the weekend because I can assemble them and then bake them off whenever I feel like having them I think we might have a Saturday night but depends on the other weekend goes so the best way to cook chicken for chicken pot pie is to roast it I've tried many different ways but I find if you do it with the bone in and with the skin on it stays really moist and it's the most flavorful so a six chicken breast chicken breast a really good butcher [Music] just rub it with good olive oil just rub the top of the skin keeps it moist [Music] sprinkle the salt this should make probably four pot pies to for TRS party two for Jeffrey and me so into the oven 375 for about 35 or 40 minutes she's gonna be really succulent and delicious next I'm gonna make the filling [Music] potpies I've made lots of them lobster potpie vegetable pot pie I think chicken pot pies the classic except for the sauce what I've done is I've cooked two onions and 1/2 sticks of butter and just for about 10 minutes until they're translucent and then I'm gonna thicken it with 3/4 of a cup of flour just stir it in and cook it for a few minutes just to get rid of that raw flour taste this is really like making a white sauce that actually is making a white sauce and after this cook for a minute or yourself gonna add 5 cups of chicken stock I actually have a little trick for chicken stock even if it's really flavorful you want the entire dish to be flavorful so I'm getting 2 bullion cubes and then slowly pour this into the the white sauce of the room and what that's going to do is really just thinking it I need two teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper remember this has to be really well-seasoned because it's gonna flavor all the chicken and vegetables and then cuz I wanted to have a little bit of richness I'm gonna add a quarter of a cup of heavy cream just to give it a little extra flavor and to this sauce I'm gonna start by adding lots of great vegetables and the secret is some of them can be frozen vegetables one and a half cups of frozen onions just think I've hard it would be to peel these onions ten ounces of frozen peas not those tiny little seeds one good big size peas and I've pledged some carrots two cups and some fresh parsley and the last thing is chicken so five cups of cubed chicken that have been roasted on the bone with the skin on to keep them really nice and succulent didn't just mix it all up oh this looks great so that's the chicken pot pie filling done and all I have to do is roll out the crust I think TR is out shopping is a very good shopper so I'm gonna get wonderful ingredients [Music] what's this salami here the large one supersonic sopressata yeah that's great like it's uh kind of that that looks delicious that looks I couldn't go well with the shoot there I hope have you tried that before is it good yeah okay and it's just it's what just sun-dried tomatoes on the top marinated with olive oil or something at herbs great now I need the desserts flourless chocolate souffle cake that sounds pretty different excuse me could I get two of these one for me one for yummy okay last part of chicken potpie putting the pastry on I actually made pastry for something else and just froze this pastry so be ready whenever I needed it and they defrost it in the refrigerator you don't want to defrost at room temperature because he needs to stay really cold so I'm just gonna leave dough there for a minute so I'm doing individual pot pies so I'm gonna put them in oven proof ramekins it's filling looks gorgeous big chunks of juicy chicken carrots whole onions now we'll need a crust top so I'm still roll out the dough I'll cut it into fourths now if you don't even have time to do the dough what you can do is get some frozen puff pastry and defrost it in the refrigerator and use that instead it's light it's wonderful and it's really easy so we're just gonna roll each one of these out into a room maybe about an 8 inch round flour everything including yourself move this over a little bit when you rolling out dough to make a round you want to keep turning it roll it from the center out to the edge this is a nice dough you just want to keep it moving make sure it never sticks to the board you can roll it on wood but if you have stone it's even better right on a counter okay now the secret to the dough sticking to the dish it's just a little bit of an egg wash that you're gonna use on the top any way around the edge it makes a little rat so just put the dough on top this obvious little too big and you just want to trim the dough so that it's about half an inch bigger than the bowl doesn't have to be perfect nice country homey rough edge is nice just like that okay and then just stick it to the edge of the bowl and it'll stick because of the egg wash that you put on it now just wash the top so the dough puffs up and it's nicely browned it's gonna be wonderful so when these bake the steam and the chicken pot pie filling will puff up the dough and it's going to turn out gorgeous and then I like to season the top with flaked sea salt so you see it it's just wonderful it's like the sea salt watch out lots of flavor cracked pepper okay that one's done just three more I've been bought the crimping I just press it right down [Music] I'm gonna bake them for an hour at 375 and they're gonna be puffed and succulent chicken tough pies I think we're all gonna have a good time [Music] Wow this actually look like chicken pot pies sometimes I even surprise myself so while those cool I think I'm gonna make some split pea soup okay two tablespoons of olive oil and a cup of onions about one yellow onion let's put the onions in first cuz they don't burn as easily the garlic just mince the garlic finely you know there's no real secret to mincing the only thing you want to do is hold the tip down with one finger and then move the handle up and down otherwise the knife jumps all over the board and it's hard to control now okay girl looks ready okay now some flavors definitely need salt and pepper why don't have teaspoons of salt I use kosher salt one teaspoon of pepper and half a teaspoon of dried oregano can't get that and just stir that around let that cook with the onions I wonder how TR is getting along with his assignment sounds like a secret mission I need a few more ingredients [Music] tomatoes I need some really great tomatoes heirloom tomatoes okay I think gonna pay and I think the onions and garlic are done look here I like this too nice to have something that's actually delicious and I'm good for you I'm gonna add two cups of carrots chopped like big chunks I want this to be really good a hearty chunky soup okay and a cup of diced potatoes nice thing about the potatoes is you don't have to peel them you don't have to bother peel taste is fine let's go cook for a long time and you want to peel anything that small anyway okay right into the pot a cups of good chicken stock this is homemade if you can make it homemade it's really worth it but if not you can find a good chicken stock in the grocery store okay and then we're gonna put in split peas so you can use about a pound of split peas which is about two cups of sweet peas total but I'm gonna only put in about one and a half cups to start with so it makes a really thick soup and they put the rest in right it got halfway through the cooking so you get very chunky just the bite of split peas also so I'm just gonna let this simmer for about 40 minutes it's gonna be a really nice sick to come home to okay I think I've wasted enough time here to miss the worst traffic we've got a couple more things to pick up and then I'm headed out to the heavens so split pea soup is half done looking pretty good so at this point halfway through the cooking I'm gonna add another half a cup of split cheese and what that does is then the split peas they're already in there get really soft and make the soup really rich and thick and then these split peas will cook a little less so they'll have a little bit of bite to them which is really good I like both textures continue to let this soup simmer and just cook it for another 40 minutes it's gonna be rich and delicious it's so good for you and TR wonderfully is bringing me from this city [Music] [Music] I would love to but I have my guests coming dude don't you which is why I cooked all this deathly I made you looking soon hmm and chicken pot pies and we carousel fantastic and I have for you a decadent dessert is there and your favorite since Tiaras brought me heirloom tomatoes I didn't make one of my favorite things for myself for dinner tonight sounds really simple it's tomato sandwich so the first thing I'm gonna do is make a little basil mayonnaise so I'm gonna start with some good mayonnaise got a cup it's gonna make a latke it'll stay stay in the refrigerator and I'm gonna fit it a little bit with some good lemon juice lots of fresh basil maybe one clove of garlic garlic goes right in need some salt pepper just whisk this all together okay next some good bread when they're just a few ingredients want to make sure they're the best ones this is the time for bakery white bread actually okay two slices of bread there's a mayonnaise on both slices redneck is always good for slicing Tomatoes oh so true so cut gorgeous it's inside it's red and yellow fantastic maybe extra basil leaves on top extra flame and I would say that's my kind of dinner without cupcake everything's ready for Jeffrey for the weekend and I'm gonna have a delicious tomato sandwich
[Music] somebody really important is coming for dinner and just let me think I'm going to make a fancy meal I'm going to do exactly the opposite turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes mmm who wouldn't love that so you know that time when somebody really important is coming to dinner maybe it's your boss or Julia Child that would be scary to me and you want to make something really special that's just the time that I make something that's really good comfort food and I serve it in the kitchen and it's relaxed and everybody has a good time so tonight my book editor is coming of course it has to be wonderful so I'm going to make turkey meatloaf parmesan some mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts and we're gonna have a great time at the kitchen table so for the turkey meatloaf I've already sauteed 2 large onions and some olive oil salt and pepper and some fresh thyme then I got out of my garden I love the smell of fresh thyme I love it in the turkey meatloaf just take it off the stem like that so I cooked it all together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and they're just cooked through but not browned and then I'm going to add some other ingredients to make it a variable I'm actually you can do this off the heat what's your shoe sauce chicken stock and some tomato paste so about 1/3 of a cup of Worcestershire sauce 3/4 of a cup of chicken stock I've homemade chicken stock but you can use a good can chicken stock and these good tomato paste really thick it'll add a lot of flavor that wanted to have two spoons I'm just going to mix that all together this is the kind of meatloaf even your husband won't believe it's not beef it's delicious so this is ground turkey it's actually better for you than ground beef and it's not you can get get it at the butcher he's going to say to you you want white 5 pounds of ground turkey it's a lot you can always cut the recipe in half but I think why not make a large quantity and you can always have it for sandwiches so I want to take all this wonderful flavoring dump it into the turkey meatloaf put in one and a half cups of plain breadcrumbs I just use package breadcrumbs they taste just as good in this recipe as homemade ones and there's so much easier and then 3 eggs and that's going to hold the mixture together this is great in the winter serve top it's also wonderful in the summer serve cold with a green salad and of course when there's lots of turkey meat love my husband's very happy because I make a meatloaf sandwiches for lunch I'm just going to pour this on top and that comes a really squishy part clean hands I'm going to just mix all this together I want to do a really lightly I don't want to pack it down so I'm going to do a really fingertip II just mix it together it Whitely until all the onions and the Worcestershire sauce and the breadcrumbs are mixed in with the turkey okay that's it nicely mixed and now all I'm going to do with really messy hands is dump it out on this pan and shape it into the meatloaf this is a really freeform meatloaf shape so I'm going to make it into a neat loaf so that's it later I'm going to pour ketchup on the top which is going to give it lots of flavor I'm going to put it in the fridge and right now I'm going shopping [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Sandy oh yeah so I think I need six browning need let's see three with nuts and free without that okay how's that yeah great I can make these myself but my friends aren't going to have more fun if I spend the day making outrageous brownie so I'm going to buy them here thanks so much handle whoop we're done so all I have to do is finish the turkey meatloaf I've got everything together here the ground turkey with onions and Worcestershire sauce and just wonderful flavorings and I'm going to put ketchup over the top of it to keep it really moist and delicious how homey is that great okay so this goes in the oven 325 for about an hour and a half and I'll show you a trick to keeping it from cracking I hate when turkey meatloaf cracks on the top and the trick is take a pan of hot water and put it underneath the turkey meatloaf and it'll keep steam in the oven and keep the meat from cracking so some hot water from the tap is perfect and that's going to be delicious if you're like me and you hate those mushy things from Thanksgiving boiled Brussels sprouts you'll love this recipe I cook the Brussels sprouts at a really high temperature 400 degrees with lots of salt and they're crisp on the outside and really tender on the inside and there's sort of more like french fries and they are like Brussels sprouts so I'm just taking off the ends of these Brussels sprouts just a little bit so it's not brown and any outside leaves that aren't gorgeous great so all I'm going to do is drizzle it with olive oil toss it with salt and pepper and into the oven it goes let's people do this in a bowl I just do it right on the baking sheet 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes and these are going to be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside that's one creaky oven when people come to my house I set up the drinks on a bar in the living room and then everybody can help themselves I hate when people are arriving I feel like race to the door race back to the drinks and this way everybody sort of connects while they're making themselves a drink just really what entertaining is about and then I'll have little things for people to eat to pistachio instead of spending the entire day making things are absolutely fine logo I just have a little nibble for people it's totally delicious and some gorgeous potato chips then I've got all the drinks set up just something simple like scotch and Soda everybody can help themselves and one last little detail which I love is when I set up the candles I get clothed whole clothes that are really spicy and wonderful and I step in and the bottom and then when you light the candle you can smell that wonderful Clovis is like having apple pies baking and later I'm going to make house of houses and now I'm going to make Provencal tomato what I'm going to do here is mix herbs breadcrumbs that I'm going to stuff these tomatoes with and then bake them with a little bit of gray air and I'm so good just put them in the food processor and I'll make fresh breadcrumbs fresh breadcrumbs are lighter and when I flavor them it's important to make them yourself as opposed to the dry breadcrumbs it opens into the turkey meatloaf put them in here this is where the Provencal part comes in so I'm going to chop up all these gorgeous herbs and add them to the breadcrumbs before I put them in the tomatoes so I need scallions and I use the white and the green part I think I like the color and the flavor of those okay so two scallions all chopped up right in some fresh basil leaves just chop them up lots of fresh basil how is your monster pesto a little fresh basil and then some parsley just cut it right off the stem that's a great thing to put together you always have some white bread and whatever herbs you have in the fridge okay parsley and fresh thyme and then the last thing is garlic and claw maybe to close the garlic should do it [Applause] this said big one so we're just going to use one clove of garlic okay so that's the breadcrumbs salt and pepper and I'm just going to toss this with my hands look how beautiful it is that's the breadcrumb part now we'll get the tomatoes ready so these are tomatoes I love to buy them on the vine I chose committees that are a little bit smaller not those big ones that you get in the middle of this summer and the one thing that's great about this recipe is it's really good with winter Tomatoes because by the time you roast them they taste delicious just going to take a little bit out of the core and then cut the entire tomato and a half I'm going to take all these seeds and pick the seeds out of the tomato because those are the crevices that I'm going to fill with a breadcrumb mixture let's sprinkle with a little salt and pepper and I want to fill it with those wonderful breadcrumbs take each tomato and just fill the crevices with these wonderful breadcrumbs with garlic and basil thyme parsley that's it look great and the last guy just enough just a little left these are going to bake for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees and then I'm going to sprinkle Gruyere cheese and let it melt for a minute over the top and now I'm going to make parmesan smashed potatoes so my book editor is coming for dinner and it's got to be good so instead of making something fancy I'm making something very earthy turkey meatloaf and to go with it my Provencal Tomatoes I just have to finish them so I've got these wonderful tomato halves that have been filled with breadcrumbs and herbs all those Provencal sort of spices garlic and basil parsley thyme and now what I'm going to do is just put a little bit of gray our cheese right on the top put them back in the oven for a minute I'm going to be even better it's going to grate it so I can put it on top where is like a Swiss cheese but I just think it has a little more flavor so you drizzle it with a little bit of olive oil just so it has great flavor it just puts in grier right on the top and it just goes back into the 400 degree oven for about 60 seconds so Parmesan smashed potatoes you won't believe how good these are I start with cooked new red potatoes so there are two secrets to why these are so good one is that I make it with the new potatoes with the skins on so you don't have to peel them and the second one is that it goes into the mixer instead of all of that potato ricing thing just put it into the mixer with a V Terron and just turned it on and they jump out of the mixer yes it get back in there so much easier and so much messier just mash them up just like that and then I'm going to put butter and cream in first I'm going to check the tomato [Music] no they're just great the cheese is melted and they look just delicious I'm leave them back here for later wonderful so I have here one and a half cups of half-and-half and a quarter of a pound of butter and I'm just going to pour enough in so that they get really creamy [Applause] and then we add half a cup of sour cream I know this is really wicked but it's really good and half a cup of Parmesan cheese oh it's great salt and pepper lots of salt salt pepper and we're looking for us for them to be creamy but sort of chunky I don't like them to be too smooth oh this looks wonderful very hot rather than keeping the potatoes warm in the oven I keep them warm over a double boiler and I find it doesn't dry up as much big bowl and just pour the potatoes in and they'll just stay hot and creamy for about a half an hour just like that and it's really easy and it's really good and the last thing I'm going to do is check my turkey meatloaf oh it looks like it's perfectly cooked it's not fabulous think there's enough and the Brussels sprouts they look great they're all crisp on the outside and I think I'm just going to leave them to warm in the oven with the oven turned off people sometimes don't remember what I make for dinner but they always remember dessert so I'm going to make something really special for my friends I'm going to do if everybody's going to have a brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and I'm going to make chocolate sauce for the top how fabulous is that mmm some of these brands have nuts and some don't for those that like it and they'll make the chocolate sauce this is really easy it's twelve ounces of chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate chips over a double boiler 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream wandering over simmering water so it doesn't get too hot and the last thing is really important I'm going to put about a teaspoon of instant espresso into the chocolate sauce and it's a huge difference in the way it tastes so I'm just going to let this sit over simmering water until it's just milk and then it can just rest there until we're ready to have dessert so my book editors coming for dinner and instead of making something really fancy I'm making something really earthy turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes I want it to be really fun and to make it even more fun we're going to have cotton poems this is a very Sex in the City drink so the recipe is 1 cup of vodka I'm going to put this beaker and then we'll shake them with ice [Music] good or ready right and half a cup of triple sec or Cointreau whichever you have half cup of cranberry juice how hard is this absolutely that color great and the last ingredient is fresh lime juice 1/4 of a cup of fresh lime juice love the color wonderful but ice in the shaker and then pour the cosmopolitan and shake and then pouring and then drinking do not look great that just looks like a party this one's mine oh we're going to have a good time and since the two girls are teenagers I have special cocktails for them maraschino cherry ginger ale it's going to look like a Manhattan and a little maraschino cherry juice but not look great and you stopping for coming all this way I've cocktail for everyone great son for Stevie and for Maya [Laughter] I said cheers everybody welcome thanks oh my god dinner's ready out of the oven smells good and Parmesan smashed potato maybe for the skins on oh good I am NOT yeah it was really chunky you know what my mother used to make me though it was so dry when I got married at home and ina said she was going to make meatloaf I very politely said I really rather have something else that she couldn't understand it then I realized it was a whole other way to make it so now I'm addicted therefore you're in big trouble of your mother ever use that story and Provencal tomatoes with basil and garlic and all kinds of protists all spices whatever baths or repetition get a bad rap brussel sprouts for jam with meatloaf Akash and jam thank you baby who knew Jeffrey boy didn't want any did you enjoy everybody this might actually enjoy it right sucessful isn't a totally different one that I've oiled ah you'll have to truly deliver nothing like hot chocolate sauce that just came all this way for right would that be all right sure everything is yours okay that's for you so I'm gonna have just a very small portion oh yeah no you're not Oh [Music]
[Music] everybody hates moving it's really fun to have a new house but then you realize you have to pack and unpack everything you've ever owned in your life my friend Greg Gayle just moved into a new house so his friend Allison and I decided it would be really nice to make him dinner and have a lovely housewarming celebration for him to start we're serving fresh radishes with golden slices of toasted French bread slathered with fresh herb butter then the most comforting dish of all mac and cheese but made really special with lots of good cheddar and Gruyere cheeses and for dessert homemade peach raspberry short cakes piled high with fresh fruit and whipped cream it's gonna be a casual night with comforting food and knowing Greg the first of many wonderful parties of his house first I'm gonna make us mac and cheese which is traditional mac and cheese with the volume turned up so to make real mac and cheese as opposed to the stuff in the box first thing I want to do is make a bechamel sauce which is really a fancy word for white sauce so I'm going to heat one quart of milk and then in another pan I'm gonna melt 6 tablespoons of butter and add half a cup of flour and cook them together for about 2 minutes while I'm whisking it you don't want the butter to burn this piccata sauce using a gret time it sounds fancy and French but it's perfect for mac and cheese okay now I just want to slowly add the hot milk and you'll see the whole thing becomes a really nice little white sauce add it whisking thank you I bet forget so we just dump it all in okay there that's fast and now off the heat it's gonna add some flavorings tablespoon of salt it seems like a lot but remember we're putting a lot of pasta in this half a teaspoon of pepper and half a teaspoon of nutmeg just sort of a classic Breton seasoning I thought would be really good with mac and cheese just whisk it together I actually think nutmeg brings out the flavour and the cheese which brings me to the next thing cheese lots of good cheese the first thing I'm going to do is put in 12 ounces of good swiss curry air it's a really nutty cheese and it's wonderful and mac and cheese and just going to take off the rind and then I'll show you a really fat me you can do this by hand with a grater if you want to but if you have a food processor it's really fast so take the grating disc just like this and then there's a post that goes on it that goes in your food processor then the top goes on it's a little bit of a process but when you see how fast it is you'll know why now isn't that amazing one more piece okay well if he's left over for the cook the second cheese I use is cheddar and I'm gonna use 8 ounces of good cheddar so I'm just gonna cut this in half and left your cheddar let's just sharp and got lots of flavor and do the same thing last piece then that would have taken a lot of time if I'd done it by hand lots of cheese okay then I'm gonna put the cheese into the sauce she isn't a song but that's why it tastes so good now okay just stir it in you don't want the heat on in this process cuz you want the cheese to melt when it's mixed with a macaroni you don't want to burn the cheese burnt cheese but so I'm going to combine this now with macaroni which I cooked actually I use cup of toffee you can certainly use macaroni but covet Happy's like that and I just thought it's a little more special for a party so put that in the bowl add the sauce [Music] it's got a pound of macaroni or cava toffee okay mix that all together but this looks like enough for crowd my experience everybody loves it so they eat a lot so import this into a dish and I'm gonna do sliced tomatoes and bread crumbs on the top here's a nice little crunch and delicious flavor with them so it really is macaroni and cheese but for a party okay into the dish how bad could that be so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take two probably two tomatoes I'll see how they take the little cores out he's a good Israeli tomatoes and they're on the vine and I cut them with a bread knife it really helps when this all bakes together the tomatoes get baked into the mac and cheese it's just wonderful so just right on top really simple and one trick is you never want the tomatoes in the refrigerator it really destroys the flavor perfect okay never break crumbs so maybe about five slices of bread just cut the crusts off cut these in pieces and then put them in the food processor with a steel blade and just were it up I just do it enough so the little crumbs but not so it's all stuck together two tablespoons of butter okay just love that one of the breadcrumbs just mix them together the butter really helps the breadcrumbs brown our nice Brown top okay right on top of the tomatoes and the mac and cheese I'm gonna bake it at 375 for 30 minutes and it's gonna be bubbly and delicious and next I'm gonna make Shortcake's real old-fashioned food and I think Greg's going to love it [Music] continuing with the theme of comfort food Alison I thought it'd be fun to make peach raspberry short cakes for Greg so I'm gonna put the short cakes and Alison is gonna buy the fruit so to make the short cakes you need 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of sugar a little sweetness tablespoon of baking powder make it rise and a teaspoon of salt to give them lots of flavor I'm putting this in a sifter just to combine them ok so this goes into the mixer fitted with a paddle attachment you can also do this by hand but it's great if you have a stand mixer one and a half sticks of butter unsalted butter you want to be really cold because you want to see bits of butter through the dough and just turn the mixer on very low and just mix it in the butter until it's like the size of large peas you don't want to totally blend it it's really important when you roll with a dough out like making scones that you can see the butter because when the heat of the oven hits the butter the moisture evaporates and it makes them light and flaky otherwise you end up with hockey pucks nobody needs hockey pucks with peaches and raspberries and while that's happening I'm gonna watch it carefully better than a mix of eggs and heavy cream 2 eggs and a half a cup of heavy cream and that's gonna be the liquid in the short cakes just beat these together a little bit half a cup of heavy cream two eggs yep perfect mix these together and then she's very quickly pour this in and you'll see it'll pull together to be a dough it's very wet and sticky it's ready okay now flour the board marbles really good for any kind of stone because it stays cold you want to use lots of flour with this because it's really sticky I usually get this all over myself and the kitchen now one good thing is you can actually make these early and bake them off before you're going to use them okay just pet it after three quarters of an inch make sure you can always get the dough to move around otherwise when you cut them you won't be able to get them off the board so three crows of an inch it's easy to tell because that's usually about an inch so have an instant measure and I use a fluted cutter if you have a plain one it's just fine dip it in flour and just cut it out these look like they're gonna be light and flaky I can see butter throughout them one good thing about this is you can make the dough early and bake them before you're gonna serve them after you've cut them out you can pile up the scraps really carefully and Pat them out again and cut more so I'm gonna bake these and then when they're cool we're gonna split them in half and fill them with lots of whipped cream and fresh peaches and raspberries thousands buying the fruits so we'll assemble them together okay last one cut it out this recipe makes six to eight depending on how thick the shortbreads are okay little egg wash so they Brown nicely it's one egg beaten with tablespoons of water or milk or cream whatever you have I've tested lots of different ways and it doesn't really make any difference a little bit of sugar give it a nice finish okay 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes and they will be puffed and brown and gorgeous [Music] [Music] so last but not least the fruit we need raspberries and pitches I know once told me that's the best way to choose a good peach is to get a little smell and squeeze it just gently to make sure that it's right great I set a theme of comfort food but now we're jumping from the United States to France classic children's sandwich when they get home from school is radishes and butter on bread and I just thought it'd be fun to make that into an order so what I'm going to do is I'm taking slices of baguette french baguette and they kind of forget that you can find it's fine I'm gonna toast them but I'm gonna make an herb butter and then serve it with fresh radishes it's surprisingly delicious and just light enough for cocktails so just nice places of french bread and they bake a little better if you do it on a baking rack I'm gonna bake them 350 for 10 minutes until they're just a little crisp and golden brown and then I'm going to take them to rags and serve them with radishes and butter okay into the oven 350 degrees for it 10 minutes I'm gonna be nice and crisp and golden enough of the earth but so with the radishes and toast for udders I'm gonna make an herb butter that I'll give it extra special flavor so the first thing I need is a quarter of a pound of butter at room temperature and I'm gonna add all kinds of fresh green herbs scallions just about wanting to have teaspoons of fresh scallions and if you have different kinds of herbs like basil it's fine use your imagination it's a very simple recipe I'm using the green of the white part of this guy but I think the green looks really nice in this it's a little milder it doesn't have to be exact just the way you like it to taste I use unsalted butter because I like to control how much salt it is different kinds of salted butter have different amounts of salt and I can never tell whether it's too salty or too sweet or what a little bit of dill mmm that smells great right in a little bit of fresh parsley never you have in the garden or the refrigerator I use flat parsley here but you can use curly parsley whatever you have around this is hardly in the exact recipe okay why don't I have teaspoons of fresh parsley half a teaspoon of salt give it lots of flavor pinch of pepper and a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice give it a little freshness try and keep the seeds in and extra flavor with seeds and just mix it together how easy is that I think when I serve it I want to take a big platter and put the radishes with salt which is a classic French thing and then maybe I'll put the herb butter on the toast and everybody can help themselves Alison is up to right now [Music] so when ina and i divided up the jobs she took all of the cooking so I told her I could at least make the cream for the short cakes one cup of heavy cream 2 tablespoons of sugar now all I have to do is get this into the fridge so the last thing I have to do before I head off to Gregg's is a ranch a nice platter of the radishes and toast with our butter so wash the radishes you want to leave the tops on they look great and just take those little roots off you can always use red radishes like these which is just delicious but if you can find white ones Icicle radishes they're candy striper radishes they're even better really delicate flavor and then because it's great to have salt with radishes I'm gonna put french sea salt it's actually a really special one called fleur de sel on the platter but few radishes around it and so people can dip them in the salt that they like to they can use kosher salt the sea salt is a very soft flavor be wonderful with this and then I'm gonna take the herb butter and just butter the toast I love appetizers like this where it's really just assembled more than anything else I wouldn't exactly call making herb butter cooking I'm so happy to do this for Greg he's just been such an incredible inspiration for me and he's fun too last one now I'm off to Greg's and Allison and I are gonna make this scrumptious peach raspberry shortcakes [Music] i slaved over these I hope you enjoy them it's their herb futons or toasts and just it's the radish in salt okay Greg Allison I have to finish dinner we'll be right back don't have any fun until we get back okay I'm gonna miss y'all good that's good okay I'll say two more things to do before dinner first one is that peach respiration shortcake I mean if I show you how to do one of them and then I'll put you in charge you're doing all of them all right so I made this short case you just cut them in half a dollop of cream and then fresh peaches with a smell so put these peaches and you got me a Rugel for Sarah yeah that's great Oliver Oh fantastic some raspberries [Music] and put that good is that look it's really easy how's that you're on your own thank you I'm gonna go make the arugula salad okay okay Alison got me gorgeous babe you look fabulous this is lesson temporary perfect so I'm just gonna put in a big bowl maybe mix-up push you got great olive oil vinaigrette in the world [Music] this is splash of vinegar [Music] [Music] I'm gonna do is put it in the bottom of the ball okay but with pasta oh my gosh I can really taste the green really tested this is really good well it's really pasta with cheese does that customer to cheese's you ready for dessert the guest of honor Alison makes a mean whipped cream you basically did the hard work great where you have one raspberry shortcake these like biscuits they are they're biscuits whipped cream and peaches and raspberries Alison the Baker we do yeah it really makes a difference is it that sort of layered flavor yeah Greg Greg Marinovich so many houses and moves into so many houses I just hope I'm invited to all of them I'll be bringing dessert how's that
in the summer when the fields here are filled with gorgeous corn I love to make fresh corn salad and you're not gonna believe how easy this is so I boiled corn for about three minutes until it's just not starchy and the way you can tell is just to take a little kernel off and taste it so you still have the fresh corn flavor and it's perfect they're crisp but they're cooked all the way through and I'm gonna put them in ice water it's called shocking them this is gonna be so good with my all-american grill and hamburgers and instead of hotdogs I'm gonna do turkey sausages and homemade coleslaw and a surprise for dessert okay so that's nicely oh you know putting it in ice water actually stops the cooking but what else it does is it keeps the bright yellow color and we wanted to look gorgeous take the little hand off right there and just stand it up in its rear end and then run your knife all the way down the cob and the kernels just come off beautifully like that when the corns fresh in Easthampton I feel like I want to eat it every day it's actually surprising how much corn you get from the kernels isn't it okay five corn right into the bowl then I'm just gonna add a few ingredients that will really give it all of its fresh corn flavor so the first thing we may add is a little red onion what are the tricks for cutting an onion is to leave the end one end on and then it keeps the whole thing together when you're cutting it so I'll show you how this works it's a slice it this way keep your fingers out of the way and this way the whole thing stays together when you're dicing it so I need about 1/2 a cup of red onion which is one small red onion okay that's done all right a little bit of cider vinegar and olive oil I think the cider vinegar is really wonderful it's sort of sweet and it enhances the fresh corn flavor three tablespoons of each oh good olive oil salt and pepper always good salt and pepper the last ingredient is fresh basil I just think corn and basil go really well together so I put them together so this is a really great little trick how did julienne basil leaves and you just stack them up one on top of the other and then roll them up like a tight cigar and then take a knife and just do really thin slices and you end up with really gorgeous julienned or sometimes called Shiva nod okay just like that toss it up it's so fresh tasting now how long do was that
it doesn't feel like summer until I do I got the grill even if it's raining I'm out there with my umbrella and usually a flashlight because it's dark grilling salmon and steaks so what could be more fun than meeting some friends at the beach for grill they're in charge of the fire I'm in charge of the food and unfortunately Jeffrey has to work so he's going to miss all the fun we'll miss you barbecued chicken you can't beat it everyone loves it some Szechuan noodle salad packed with crisp summer vegetables for color you know I always love something green with a meal broccoli with garlic and soy and then those coast to coast favorites some mores oh we have some great tips to returning plain old vanilla ice cream into a great desserts everything from just drowning an espresso the Italian way to serving it with fabulous fresh raspberry sauce I've a party to get ready for I better get going I'm always looking for new ways to cook chicken but nothing says some are more than cooking chicken on a grill and I'm going to marinate it in barbecue sauce the history of this barbecue sauce is pretty amazing years ago at Barefoot Contessa I asked the chef to make three different kinds of barbecue sauce so we could test them I thought well one should be sort of mustardy one should be tomato way and one would be maybe chinesey and I don't know when they came out one was to mustardy one was to tomato II and of course one was to chinesey so I took them home and I thought well let me play with a little bit and I took all three of them I dumped them in one pot and it was a fabulous barbecue sauce and that's what I've been using for 25 years so it's got a lot of ingredients but it's really worth making so what I've done here is I've sautéed one and a half cups of onions and vegetable oil with lots of garlic for about about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and then I'm going to add all these ingredients 1 cup of tomato paste just like one and a half of these small cans then one cup of cider vinegar it's good it's got some sweetness to it a cup of honey this jar is 16 ounces so I need about half and none if this has to be exact just close one cup of mustard I use good Dijon mustard this is 8 ounces so that should do it one cup of hoisin sauce which is the Chinese part of the recipe and horsin sauce is like a plum sauce it's very often used for duck and it's great in this and this jar is 8 ounces so it's just a cup that's the hoisin sauce and then 1/2 a cup of Worcestershire sauce oh I hate these little things that they put on the top so this is 5 ounces so I need most of this jar have a cup of soy sauce and all this can be just approximately just until it tastes great to you and then lots of great spices so I'm going to put in 2 tablespoons of chili powder it's gonna add lots of spice to it 2 tablespoons of chili powder not quite that much 1 tablespoon of cumin which is sort of a tex-mex spice like that and had the tablespoon of really hot red pepper flakes and you can make this as hot as you want but it's sort of hot but not really hot so I'm just going to simmer this for about 30 minutes till all the flavors blend together - bet Jeffrey has to go to work we know how much he loves chicken how I am about buying things for party rather than making them ice cream is a perfect example why bother making it I'd love to start with good vanilla ice cream lots of toppings and I end up with a dessert that everybody loves so I'm taking vanilla ice cream with great simple toppings it turns grown-ups into fun stirs it works every time I thought I'd make fresh raspberry sauce over vanilla ice cream it's four ingredients and it takes less than ten minutes to make how good is that so start by cooking the raspberries pour them into a pan half a pint of luscious right there is just the right amount and then the sugar half a cup now some water quarter of a cup in the pan turn off the heat okay so that's boiling now now lower the heat and let it simmer for four minutes so while that cooks pulling out a cup of raspberry jam what's seedless raspberry jam because the fresh fruit will have enough seeds in it then add to the bowl of the food processor that's been fitted with a steel blade now Framboise it's a clear raspberry flavored brandy that you can find in the liquor store so now pour in the raspberries and switch the Machine on once the sauce really smooth great that's perfect when you're ready to serve dessert just spoon some of the sauce over scoops of vanilla ice cream and I promise you everyone will be in heaven and no one will know that it took you just 10 minutes to me this house is also great with meringues it's wonderful for entertaining because you can make in a day or two in advance here's another idea and it couldn't be easier it's Italian it's called affogato it's a scoop of vanilla ice cream with how two spresso poured over it it's hot and it's cold it's absolutely delicious so first things first make the espresso everyone's got different machines you know how yours works I'm using one chair for example follow the instructions and the amounts for your machine but make sure you use espresso coffee or it won't be unduly authentic if you don't have an espresso maker you can just buy prepared espresso from a coffee shop and then just heat it up before dessert so get your ice cream ready when the coffee's hot pour right over the ice cream it's as simple as that mmm the mix of cold vanilla ice cream and piping hot espresso they melt together it's absolutely sublime well it's too early in the morning for ice cream but Jeffrey and I could definitely use a cup of espresso hi sweetie hi Watson coffee oh yeah thanks I can't believe you're gonna miss our party I know it's gonna be really fun we save me something yeah I'm having barbecued chicken your favorite oh my god save you some where are you gonna cook it on the beach of course oh I'm sorry you're miss having all that sand in you right that's it let's take the sand off okay can't wait to get to the beach everybody's there lighting the grill getting everything ready I'm just gonna marinate the chicken so just gonna put it in the bowl oh it's not chicken to make sure it's fresh oh so I'm just gonna pour some marinade over it one thing you want to do though is make sure it's cold I'm actually combine the chicken and the marinade overnight that's even better so I'm just gonna layer it all together smudge it all around is a technical thing smudge so that's the chicken of the marinade ooh cold okay chicken hands definitely want to wash these okay into the fridge with a chicken we're gonna have a great barbecue later perfect timing so to go with a barbecue chicken I'm gonna make Szechuan noodles sort of tex-mex meets Asian fusion so the first thing I do is cook the pasta naturally instead of using Chinese noodles I use Italian dry pasta really it sort of works better this is fettuccine you can use spaghetti any kind of pasta like that is just great this has lots of great ingredients but it also has lots of flavor first thing is 6 cloves of garlic all chopped up right into the food processor okay next thing is ginger this is what ginger looks like it's a very certain orally but what you want to do is with a sharp knife peel it and then chop it up it's got great flavor I need a better quarter of a cup chopped up okay just check this up sort of roughly it's going to get really pureed in the food processor so it doesn't have to be perfect chopped up nice okay about 1/4 of a cup into the food processor ok now all these things from the pantry most of them you probably already have half a cup of vegetable oil half a cup of tahini which is sesame paste sort of middle-eastern you can find it you can't find it in the grocery store you probably can you can certainly find in a specialty store okay have a couple have a cup of peanut butter I mean how bad can a sauce be if it's got peanut butter in it so then 1/2 a cup of this this looks like really good peanut butter half a cup of soy sauce this is really all the salt in it plus lots of other flavor Ryan and then quarter of a cup of honey that's a quarter of a cup let's see it doesn't have to be exact quarter of a cup of dry sherry this is from the liquor store that should do it quart of a cup of sherry vinegar mmm I love the smell that it's great in vinaigrettes - I should do it two tablespoons of sesame oil you don't want the clear one you want the one that smells like really roasted sesame seeds it's a dark sesame oil has so much flavor and now comes the heat I'm gonna add cayenne pepper just a pinch just enough to give it some heat Asian chili oil which is really hot whoa and some black pepper and that should do it that's it thick it looks so delicious I can smell the ginger and the garlic it's gonna be great but I think the pasta is ready just done okay oh I said hot ok I need all the sauce save them something later and then toss it together with the hot noodles it's actually great type of sauce on the hot noodles it really absorbs the flavor an apple is electro sauce because as the noodles cool or the pasta cools it's gonna absorb more sauce and now we're going to add some other great Asian ingredients slice scallions as much as you like yellow peppers red peppers so it's great because it's pasta and it's wonderful sauce and it's vegetables and it's going to be so good with barbecued chicken I think a little extra scallions I'll do it perfectly on this so I'm just slicing on the diagonal put right on top and that looks delicious ready for the beach you so my friends are at the beach I have one thing left to do broccoli with garlic broccoli is cooking away and what I've done is I've cooked garlic whole cloves of garlic in oil for about 15 minutes the garlic is a perfectly tender and then the oil is infused with a garlic flavor it's great you add a little heat to it some red peppers this is great for picnic and just put it in containers and everybody can eat it to the beach okay that's going to sit for a minute so the broccoli should be just about done just going to blanch it for about 2 or 3 minutes so it's really just tender but still crisp like a salad and it should be just done right now so it's going to go right into ice water I want to stop the cooking immediately it's called shocking it and what it's going to do is stop the cooking and also set the color so it's going to be bright green nobody wants to eat brown broccoli salad okay just for a minute until it's cool then I'm going to drain it and then put a sauce on turn it really well cuz when the broccoli is dry it will hold much more of the sauce okay right into a bowl and now what I'm going to do is just add some of the garlic oil a little bit of the oil tossed around it just enough to flavor it the whole cloves of garlic which are actually really sweet when they're cooked like this that looks pretty good and since we have an Asian thing going I thought maybe instead of salt I'd use a little soy sauce on it just a few tablespoons toss it all together and how easy is that already for the beach only when you go to a beach party and everybody's on their own blanket I don't feel like I'm at the same party I think it's so much nicer to all be together one big party so I've gone out and gotten some straw window shades all kinds of wacky things inexpensive pillows that I got on sale and and then we can all be together have the table in the middle and well really comfortable hey it's a great way to have a party so marinating this for a couple of hours but it's even better if you marry me for a couple of days and you don't have to cook the chicken at all before you know and just put it on the grill you know the key is not making sure that the grill is far enough away from the cold the outside doesn't burn before the chicken cooks the friend of mine sits on the barbeque until the fire department shows that this says wa noodles and broccoli I love the package yes where I got the Chinese takeout place perfect so shall I see it the chickens ready it's just cooking away here looking at this so you wanna have a hand up he needs our they put it right there plates napkin lots of napkins good math absolutely okay so one started I'm gonna double up big play it's beautiful smells really how'd I do anyone barbecue chicken with lots of napkins with the salt finger food okay another leg whoa okay and what we missing I like stars oh yeah okay that's a chicken that's great absolute is required okay time for some more I feel like a Pied Piper as in anything that large yells people of all you anywhere right that's true right okay I would've had to make some more any news no okay so we have graham cracker yes sharp and we have sticks you can just use regular stick so we have fancy sticks okay so everybody gets marshmallow do you do one or two heroes tonight okay I like that approach okay the two marshmallows on the fire oh this is Devon this one a look at this this is go that's great wait a minute I want some no turns out that Girl Scout training was really that's the only thing you learned in girls have been music oh right oh that's good wait come I got it all over my pants I'd say the s'mores are great it's not a picnic without the sand you know how much he loves chicken and how I am about buying things for a party rather than making them ice cream is a perfect example why bother making it I'd love to start with good vanilla ice cream lots of toppings and I end up with a dessert that everybody loves so I'm taking vanilla ice cream with great simple toppings it turns grownups into funsters it works every time I thought I'd make fresh raspberry sauce over vanilla ice cream it's four ingredients and it takes less than 10 minutes to make how good is that so start by cooking the raspberries pour them into a pan half a pint of luscious ripe berries is just the right amount and then the sugar half a cup now some water quarter of a cup in the pan turn off the heat okay so that's boiling now now lower the heat and let it simmer for four minutes so while that cooks pulling out a cup of raspberry jam what's seedless raspberry jam because the fresh fruit will have enough seeds in it then add to the bowl of the food processor that's been fitted with a steel blade now Framboise it's a clear raspberry flavored brandy that you can come in the liquor store sunette pour in the raspberries and switch the machine on once the salt and that looks delicious ready for the beach so my friends are at the beach I've one thing left to do broccoli with garlic broccoli is cooking away and what I've done is I've cooked garlic whole cloves of garlic in oil for about 15 minutes the garlic is a perfectly tender and then the oil is infused with a garlic flavor it's great you add a little heat to it some red peppers this is great for picnic and just put it in containers and everybody can eat at the beach okay that's going to sit for a minute so the broccoli should be just about done just going to blanch it for about 2 or 3 minutes so it's really just tender but still crisp like a salad and it should be just done right now so it's going to go right into ice water I want to stop the cooking immediately it's called shocking it and what it's going to do is stop the cooking and also set the color so it's going to be bright green nobody wants to brown broccoli salad okay just for a minute until it's cool then I'm going to drain it and then put a sauce on trained it really well cuz when the broccoli is dry it will hold much more of the sauce okay right into a bowl Rick have two flakes and you can make this as hot as you want but it's sort of hot but not really huh so I'm just going to simmer this for about 30 minutes until all the flavors blend together to bit Jeffrey has to go to work we know how much he loves chicken and how I am about buying things for a party rather than making them ice creams a perfect example why bother making it I'd love to start with good vanilla ice cream lots of toppings and I end up with a dessert that everybody loves so I'm taking vanilla ice cream with great simple toppings it turns grown-ups into funsters it works every time I thought I'd make fresh raspberry sauce over vanilla ice cream it's four ingredients and it takes less than 10 minutes to make how good is that so start by cooking the raspberries pour them into a pan half a pint of luscious ripe berries it's just the right amount and then the sugar half a cup now some water sort of a cup in the pan turn off the heat okay so that's boiling now now lower the heat and let it simmer for four minutes so while that cooks pulling out a cup of raspberry jam what's seedless raspberry jam because the fresh fruit will have enough seeds in it then add to the bowl of the food process and you can make this as hot as you want but oh it's sort of hot but not really huh so I'm just going to simmer this for about thirty minutes until all the flavors blend together two bit Jeffrey has to go to work we know how much he loves chicken and how I am about buying things for a party rather than making them ice creams a perfect example why bother making it I'd love to start with good vanilla ice cream lots of toppings and I end up with a dessert that everybody loves so I'm taking vanilla ice cream with great simple toppings it turns grownups into funsters it works every time I thought I'd make fresh raspberry sauce over vanilla ice cream it's four ingredients and it takes less than ten minutes to make how good is that so start by cooking the raspberries pour them into a pan half a pint of luscious ripe berries it's just the right amount and then the sugar half a cup now some water quarter of a cup in the pan turn off the heat okay so that's boiling now now lower the heat and let it simmer for four minutes so while that cooks pulling out a cup of raspberry jam what's seedless raspberry jam because the fresh fruit will have enough seeds in it then add the bowl of the food processor that's been fitted with a steel blade turn it really well cuz when the broccoli is dry it will hold much more of the sauce okay right into a bowl and now what I'm going to do is just add some of the garlic oil a little bit of the oil tossed around it just enough to flavor it the whole cloves of garlic which are actually really sweet when they're cooked like this that looks pretty good and since we have an Asian thing going I thought maybe instead of salt I'd use a little soy sauce on it just a few tablespoons toss it all together and how easy is that already for the beach only when you go to a beach party and everybody's on their own blanket I don't feel like I'm at the same party I think it's so much nicer to all be together one big party so I've gone out and gotten some straw window shades all kinds of wacky things inexpensive pillows that I got on sale and then we can all be together at the table in the middle and well really comfortable hey it's a great way to have part of the one should be tomatoey and one would be maybe chinesey and i don't know when they came out one was two mustardy one was two tomatoey and of course one was two chinesey so I took them home and I thought well let me play with it a little bit and I took all three of them I dumped them in one pot and it was a fabulous barbecue sauce and that's what I've been using for 25 years so it's got a lot of ingredients but it's really worth making so what I've done here is I've sautéed one and a half cups of onions and vegetable oil with lots of garlic for about about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and then I'm going to add all these ingredients 1 cup of tomato paste which is like one and a half of these small cans and then 1 cup of cider vinegar it's good it's got some sweetness to it a cup of honey this jar is 16 ounces so I need about half and none if this has to be exact just close one cup of mustard I use good Dijon mustard this is 8 ounces so that should do it one cup of hoisin sauce which is the Chinese part of the recipe and hoisin sauce is like a plum sauce it's very often used for duck and it's great in this and this jars
[Music] my friend Victoria Munro has a wonderful art gallery in East Hampton and every month she gives a party for a new exhibition I'm gonna cater the party this time and I'm gonna do a food table that's really easy to cook and consider a couple of hours and still look great so I thought I'd make grilled lemon chicken on sticks and a set a sauce for dipping juicy ripe figs served with thinly sliced prosciutto Greek spinach and feta strudels called spanakopita puff pastry cheese draws fruit and cheese platter and my friend Miguel is making the most amazing food topiaries inspired by the gallery I'm gonna use a nice big white cloth as my canvas and I'll create for Victoria an edible work of art grilled lemon chicken with satay dip is a great thing to make for cocktail party you can do a lot of it in advance I'll show you how so the first thing I want to do is marinate the chicken lemon juice olive oil fresh thyme so it really gets into the chicken the cup of lemon juice fresh lemon juice 3/4 of a cup of good olive oil now I need a tablespoon of fresh thyme 2 teaspoons of kosher salt it's really like making a lemon vinaigrette and 1 teaspoon of pepper and I'm just gonna whisk it all together for boneless chicken breasts with the skin off - I was gonna put them right in the marinade just put them in turn them over make sure they're really covered in the marinade okay now we're Gala big our it and get the table started [Music] it's gonna be really funny love my friend Victoria Monroe she has a fabulous gallery so I just picked a menu that I can make an advance things that consider room temperature really easily and for the bar it's gonna be water and wine really simple and everybody's gonna help them I want to do some topiaries with food what's around exact tomatoes and strawberries oh how fabulous you'll see we could always knocks my socks off and I've got the tablecloth sorry you want to help me put it on okay great so let me show you something I learned in decades of catering how to get rid of all this excess fabric and make the Tim Club really neat so put your finger right here where the excess fabric is and then you take the cloth from the other corner and pull it straight up along the front and everything so that's folded for us takes a few times to figure it out what you do it makes such a difference and now but it's also just take this and put your finger back in that corner and pull this straight across and now give a nice neat top and a perfect corner okay Miguel I'm gonna leave you on your own what I can't wait to see what you do so the next thing we're gonna make is gonna be great for a food table at the gallery our spinach strudels and they're called spanakopita so the first thing I have here is one bunch of scallions chopped and better half a cup of olive oil just saute for about five minutes until the scallions are wilted and then two ten ounce boxes of frozen chopped spinach just squeeze the liquid out not so it's bone-dry just said most of the liquid is out I'm a second box sometimes people do this in a kitchen towel but you just ruin the kitchen towel so I'll just do it with your nose okay I'm just gonna take the sauteed onions and olive oil I'm just gonna mix the cold spinach with the warm scallions some adding eggs next I don't want them to scramble okay three eggs just let's go mix it lightly and then just added to the spinach since scallions okay mix that in so I'm gonna add 8 ounces of feta just Greek cheese goes with spinach strudels that 8 ounces right in okay mix that in now I'm gonna add some fresh dill okay that should be about 2 tablespoons okay now salt and pepper 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper and just mix it all up and that's the filling perfect okay so now for the phyllo dough I'll show you what this is so it's in the freezer in the grocery store it's a very very thin dough pastry showing a house in earnest it's like paper thin that's how thin it is I'm gonna take one sheet brush it with melted butter just brush it all over but quickly and then the second sheet right on top you want to place it on top of it because of the butter it won't slide right on top first that with melted butter so I'm piling up ten sheets of phyllo dough brushing with butter in between and sometimes with bread crumbs okay that's ten so I'm going to take a quarter of the filling and just run it right along the edge of this of the strudel and while I'm doing this I'm going to take this damp cloth and put it right on top of the phyllo dough that I haven't used yet to keep it moist so pick up one corner and pull it right up over the filling and take the middle and if it tears don't worry about it you're just gonna keep folding it rolling it up want it to be even perfect okay take this strew don't put it right on the baking sheet okay brush the top with butter so it gets nice and brown when it bakes and then with a sharp knife I'm just going to score the top so after its baked it's very easy to cut I like to do diagonal slices if you'd like them any other way but anyway you like okay then I'm gonna make the other four rolls and later these are going to bake at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes and after that I'm gonna make satay sauce for the chicken and the cheese straws so for the party I'm doing my friend Victoria's art gallery next thing we're gonna make is set a dip for the grilled lemon chicken satay dip is a Indonesian peanut sauce and it's really good with strips of grilled lemon chicken so what I've done here is I've cooked a small red onion and some olive oil and sesame oil I'm gonna add why don't I have teaspoons of chopped garlic fresh garlic and then I'm gonna add some ginger this is what ginger looks like when if you buy it in the store and what you do is take a knife and just peel off the outside and then chop it up I already have some chopped here but it's good to cook it because it's kind of woody and about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of chopped ginger and 1/4 of a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes she's a red hot peppers you don't want too much just enough for some heat and just cook that for about five minutes just until it's all soft them together okay while that's cooking I'm gonna get the spanakopita out of the [Music] the spinach strudels mmm they've done they're nice and brown and really crisp on the outside and then when they're cool I'm just gonna cut them all the way through and serve them unless big square plate I think it's gonna be great so the onions garlic and ginger are already softened I'm gonna add a lot of ingredients two tablespoons of red wine vinegar few tablespoons of good soy sauce and 2 tablespoons of actually sherry not sure you're gonna grow but after sharing and putting a cup of brown sugar korie's cup of ketchup and a half a cup of [Music] so I'm gonna put in together we're gonna have teaspoons of fresh lime juice I'm just gonna cook this on the low heat until it's all blended I just can't wait to see what the girls during those two fries they sound amazing I'm going to create opre and I'm going to cover them with tomatoes and mozzarella balls [Music] taking the same idea from mr. combs I got this fear next thing fickt aureus gallery albany is cheese straws but cheese straws could be a daunting thing to make but I have a secret weapon frozen puff pastry you can find it in the freezer section of almost any grocery store in the United States and you wanted very cold I defrosted it overnight in the refrigerator so it's still very cold and now I'm gonna roll it out just a little bit until it's about ten inches by 12 inches just a little bit bigger and you want to work really fast so it stays cold the egg wash which I'm gonna brush on it's gonna make the cheese which I'll have later stick puff pastry is layers of flour and butter and when the heat hits it it just puffs up and gets really light and flaky so I'm gonna put on grier about 1/2 a cup I'm just gonna sprinkle it on so evenly I've got a quarter of a cup of parmesan it's finely grated sprinkle it over evenly don't neglect the corners you want to be sure everybody gets a little bit of the cheese's a little bit of fresh thyme I have to say I do use a lot of time I like it it's a nice fresh herb little salt and pepper then take your rolling pin and just very lightly press it in there don't even press just run your rolling pin right along there okay and now what I'm gonna do and the Sheep pen parchment paper and we do long thin strips about about an inch wide just cut strips if it sticks just flour the knife and you won't have any problem these are gonna make big cheese straws but I think they look great on a food table so I'm going to take each of these slices and put it on the sheet right and just twist it was it just like that if they get too warm while you're working with them you can always put them in refrigerator for a few minutes before you bake them okay into the oven 375 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes and then we turn them and baked it for another 2 minutes to make sure they're nice and crisp all right [Music] time to grill the chicken for the grilled chicken with satay dip so this is the chicken that I marinated in lemon juice olive oil and thyme and this is a grill pan which is great when you don't want to heat a charcoal grill outside you can do it inside just be really careful you want great ventilation and you want to get it really hot I've let it sit on the flame for about four minutes until it got really hot just gonna put the chicken on put an angle and you get crosshatch marks it's gonna cook for about eight to ten minutes on each side so chicken breasts are different thicknesses so make sure it's cooked through now you see why I need good ventilation okay I think my Parmesan cheese straws are done [Music] they look great so if that almost a very good cook now we take it to the gallery and they are I'm going to do the cheese platter and the face of your shooter so just a few last-minute things to do before I go to the gallery the chickens cooled enough so I can handle it I'm just gonna slice it it's life side of the angle and now I'm gonna put it on these bamboo skewers you can find them in the grocery store just run it right up the middle of it what I'm doing but I always like to try and find things that are best when they're served at room temperature and chicken with satay is one of them the chickens great at room temperature and the satay dip is okay onto the tray I'm just gonna cut up the spoon strudels and I scored them so it would be really easy to slice you can see the film it's beautiful spinach and feta and dill it smells so good it's really crisp on the outside [Music] it's a little messy now but when it's on a big white square platter it's gonna look great it's gonna taste terrific [Music] and now I'm ready to go [Music] yeah the whole gallery smells like strawberries and it's great because everybody can just pick one off dose of me and what about this otherwise I'm not gonna be ready Victoria you think this is your office as a caterer you can imagine the places I've had to set up this is pretty elegant so do you mind if I do my cheese platter here let me show you how to do a cheese tray it's actually not very complicated but there are few details that make it look great one is some lemon leaves as a base it's amazing how it sort of sets off the white of the cheese pick cheeses that people know like Brie and when you put it on the tray have it facing out and actually if you have a very big piece of cheese what I like to do is take a little slice and put it right on top and gives it a little height so one big chunk of Stilton right on the platter also facing out so now I've got a creamy cheese a blue cheese and I'm gonna put a goat cheese on so this is a bucheron and I think this one I'm just gonna cut right in half if you have one really big piece of cheese nobody will start it so it's really important to do slices and then people will help themselves the temptation at this point is to put a million different things on as decorated but it'll look like a dog's breakfast you want to take a big bunch of grapes put it right smack in the middle right like that and then I just like to take fresh strawberries and put them on the outside very simple in big big groups not sort of one here and one there but like a whole grouping of strawberries and then to some crackers around the outside really simple English water biscuits are great the key to this is everyone's going to help themselves so Victoria and I can have to get the party done fixing prosciutto next and I'm doing something major like a gallery opening I want really simple things one of the simplest and most delicious is figs in prosciutto so what I'm doing is I'm going to do a big platter with just with fresh figs and you want to pick figs that really smell like figs when they're really ripe they're just gorgeous little overripe is actually even good just cut them in half and you can either wrap the prosciutto around the fig or do what I'm doing which is just put the figs around the outside and the prosciutto on the inside and let everybody help themselves it's a very Italian appetizer I love the sweet fig that really sort of sweet juicy fig and the saltiness of the prosciutto okay that's done hey Miguel we didn't do such a bad job don't we fix them for Judah and actually here you want to hold these actually so there are a few principles about doing a food table that are really important to me one is that you have big platter so it's not lots of little things they have lots of height I would say if you have Miguel doing the topiaries you're in good shape and what I like to do is raise some of these platters so everything is not flat so all I did just take like a white souffle dish and just put a square platter on top of it and these are built up their cheese straws that are built up like Lincoln locks here I'm gonna do some more so just in opposite directions perfect and the spinach strudels that I scored earlier then we cut them all the way through so they're really finger food everything on the table is finger food and the best part is everything can sit out for a few hours during the gallery opening so what do you think Miguel did we do okay looks pretty good thanks so much thank you [Music] [Music] I think that was a success and love the food table it's very casual people wander in help themselves look at the painting go back to the table it's my kind of party of course it always helps San Miguel help out and I think there might be a cheese drawer with my name I'm redrawn
when it comes to comfort food I say mac and cheese is pretty high in everybody's list so for dinner tomorrow night I thought I'd make a grown up mac and cheese with bacon and blue cheese okay so I need one and a half cups of milk and I'm going to heat it up and then in another pot two tablespoons of butter [Music] come on the heat two tablespoons of flour so I'm just going to cook these together for about two minutes you don't want the butter to burn let's whip them together so this cook butter and flour is going to act as a thickener for the sauce now I'm going to add the hot milk to it and it's going to stick in it okay I'm just going to cook that over low heat until it just gets a little thicker okay let's see how this is doing oh the white sauce is just perfect now it's thickened it's not incredibly thick but what it does is just coat the spoon so now off the heat I'm going to add all the cheese's so 1/2 a cup of Korea third of a cup of cheddar and about 2 ounces of Roquefort you can really use any kind of blue cheese but Roquefort has a particularly wonderful flavor a little bit of nutmeg it's a really classic spice that's used in grit towns you should won't know what's there but it'll make everything else taste better give it a stir so the cheese is all melted that's a much better way to do bacon so it's not splattering all over the place just chop it up [Music] but it right is okay time to drain the pasta simply put this break back into the sauce to stir it around this is so easy to make it a large quantity but it's just stripped in naming it for two and the best thing I can make it today and bake it off tomorrow when I can spend tomorrow with Jeffrey instead of cooking okay a little bit of a topping so it's sort of crunchy on the top so it takes to take two pieces of white bread cut up the cross and just chop them up put them in the bowl of a food processor with a steel blade and just a little bit of fresh basil a couple leaves right in the food processor with it bread folks it builds from [Music] okay and just right on top of the mac and cheese so it's creamy on the bottom and crunchy on the top okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake it tomorrow knife for cozy and comforting dinner for Jeffrey me [Music]
[Music] I love to entertain every once in a while I have to say this day is for me a little exercise lots of pampering and some really healthy food this is good for me day [Music] I'm being really good to myself today I'm having a really healthy day so instead of having the usual bagel and cream cheese I'm going to make a tropical smoothie first thing I'm going to take this half of papaya and it's perfectly ripe so it's going to be wonderful to take these little seeds out and then I'll kill it and just check the whole thing into the blender so the most important thing for this is that the fruit is really ripe and it's just delicious you put flavorless fruit in you're just going to get a flavor with smoothie out it's that simple I'm going to cut it in big chunks and into the bladder that smells so good and I'm going to put 1/2 a mango in mango has a huge stone in the middle so if you want to just cut the edges off and one banana actually a banana is really important because it makes the smoothie really thick delicious some skim milk no fat some fresh orange juice and as long as I'm doing it to nonfat yogurt and a little bit of water and some ice to make it thick and maybe a little honey to make it sweet but just a little bit perfect [Applause] that looks delicious all the nutrition I need for my walk so good something having a really healthy day good food what's your favorite healthy food so it's even more oh that's what I'm doing actually that's great this movie to start with yeah that was the month so I'm gonna make myself grill tune with mango salsa for lunch that healthy it sounds pretty good I think it's a little salad with that you can get much better that's great [Music] we're going to take a quick shower and then I'm going to make my seared tunas mango salsa let me start with a tuna just one steak just for me and I'm going to season it with salt and pepper both sides this is gorgeous and you let it sit and the key about the tune is I'm going to get a pan very very hot before I put it in so it Sears the outside and while I'm doing that I'm making mango salsa I sautéed some onions and ginger about two onions and two teaspoons of ginger and olive oil just until the onions are translucent and I'm going to add some chopped garlic there's some really interesting flavors in this and I was trying to add the garlic at the last minute because I don't want to burn it so cook that for a second and then I'm going to add two mangoes that I've peeled seeded and diced oh just a wonderful little orange juice except sort of tropical flavors which is great the little brown sugar sweetened it now being healthy doesn't mean you have to deprive yourself you can have really delicious food and it's important to have a good meal otherwise you feel hungry all day so I want to do a little jalapeno which is wonderful I be careful of these guys you want to take all the seeds out it's the inside that's really really hot I'm going to chop this up I'm going to take out all the seeds and the rib and whatever you do don't rub your eye while you're doing this it's really hot and have the food and then I'm going to dice it and put it in I like a little bit of heat if you like a lot you can use the whole jalapeno if you don't like it at all leave it out okay so that's going to go in a little closed orbit I'm just going to cook this for a few minutes into the orange juice is reduced and the mangos a nicely cooked and meanwhile I'm going to sear the tuna so the key to this is this pan is really hot before you put the tuna in and it really Sears the outside it would be so delicious so maybe two minutes on each side while I stir the mangos awesome just about done and then I'm going to take it off the heat at the end and just add fresh mint into it it's going to be delicious so I'm going to just flip the tuna over you can see it's just starting to cook on the bottom and I'm going to chop some fresh mint I think sauce is sort of like chutney I like when it's sweet and the top and it's spicy I love it mint oil it releases it no this is looking gorgeous great and the tune is ready turn off the heat and just put the mint in just because it's lunchtime on diffusion the incredibly delicious the seeds it's really seared on the outside and raw on the inside it can be incredibly beautiful thanks googled mango salsa we turn the spices with fresh mint and once it's ready [Music] I mean so delicious nobody would ever believe it's good for you I think I'll just hang out here for a while and afterwards I'm going to accept a key that's so easy you won't believe it so the next thing I want to make is said C key which is a classic Greek yogurt and cucumber dip this takes a minute to make as long as you've done the preparation in advance so what I have here is 2 cups of low fat yogurt that I've drained and the liquid comes out of the bottom and it becomes more like a cheese you'll see when I dump it out and here I have one cucumber that I graded salted and allowed that to drain too so all the liquid is out and I'm just going to dump that in together so we've got cucumber and yogurt it's really important to drain both of them because I want a really thick delicious dip so now I'm going to add back lots of flavor so the first thing I do is that 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and so olive oil and some chopped garlic because Greek food always has to have chopped garlic and lots of fresh dill since we're being very healthy low-fat sour cream and mix all this together it looks great this is so wonderful as a dip for vegetables sort of stuff in pita bread and I'm just going to keep it in the fridge all week so whenever I reach for droplets of cookie I'll have said Zeki instead and I think the last thing is inspector so this looks great I have some crudité to have it with a little icicle radishes and purple strain beans and some sugar snap peas just because it's low-fat doesn't mean it can't be delicious fabulous [Music] [Music] just because something's healthy doesn't mean it have to look like a bowl of oatmeal so I'm making beet salad with orange and I think it's just gorgeous and delicious and good for me this is one of the wonderful things with canned beets are just as good as fresh beets and there's so much easier you won't believe it so these are three cans of baby beets that I'm just cutting in half and they're really delicious and they can be really messy so be careful don't get them on yourself so now I'm going to make a vinaigrette with a little bit of raspberry vinegar I love the sweetness of the raspberry vinegar with the beets and some olive oil don't even need another bowl for the vinaigrette just do it right on the beat lots of salt and pepper the good thing about this is you can make it put it in the fridge and it just gets better as it sits so I'm going to make some today and then I'll have it all week whenever I want a refrigerator look for something bad to eat I'll see the beets and I'll know it's time to eat something really good so the next thing I'm going to do is it's orange I try and get as much flavor out of the orange as I can by zesting the outside and then I'm going to put the whole orange segments into the beet salad it's gonna be just delicious zest of the outside and now I'm going to peel the rind off and put the orange segments right into the salad I think there's something about the sweetness of the beets and the acidity of the orange that are really great together never mind I think the colors are fabulous I sound like a client of mine who one time the interior design client who came into the store and said I want one Brown saying one red thing and one green thing to serve for dinner and sometimes the color is really important but the flavor is important too I'm just going to squeeze the rest of this and then one more orange okay lots of death and then more orange segments just want to be sure you take all the white part off it's called the pith absolutely is that okay that's it more juice and the last ingredients to chopped red onion which gives a little spice aren't those colors fabulous and just toss this all together and that gorgeous just taste it to make sure it's seasoned right how easy with that so good really the orange really brings out the beach flavor and it's just delicious it's going to be good for me all week long [Music] next one next Mercer tomato basil soup and think a little retail therapy might be good for me I'm having a really healthy day and one of the things I love to do is have things in the refrigerator so when I'm reaching for chocolate-chip cookie there's something good for me there so making roasted tomato basil soup which is easy to make absolutely delicious first thing I did with roast tomatoes I just took plum tomatoes cut them in half toss them with olive oil salt and pepper and cook them for 45 minutes at about 400 degrees and they get really sweet this is actually a great vegetable too but I'm going to make soup out of it so what I have in the pan is I've cooked two onions and six cloves of garlic lots of garlic with a little bit of olive oil for about 10 minutes until they're translucent and start to brown and now I'm just going to toss a lot of other delicious things in the roasted tomatoes roasting this way even in the winter gives them really good summer tomato flavor it's 3 pounds of roasted tomatoes just put them right in there and they just get it such great flavor you love the smell of that I'm going to add some fresh thyme let's take it off so stem next thing is a little crushed red pepper place give it a little heat a few tablespoons of olive oil to give it a little richness and then one of the key ingredients with fresh basil and I mean lots of fresh basil so I'm just going to take the leaves off the stem and just throw the whole basil leaves right into this pot tomatoes and basil is such a classic combination okay that's 4 cups of fresh basil leaves I'm just going to toss them right into the pot fabulous two more key ingredients whole can of tomatoes with the juice and the puree and everything in it and a quart of homemade chicken stock but you can also use canned chicken stock if you have a good one and if you vegetarian you can always use water I like a little chicken stock last two things a salt and pepper and that's just going to simmer for about 45 minutes on low heat and it's going to just be absolutely delicious in the meantime I'm going shopping with my friend Miguel he loves to shop and he's got great taste my idea of a great day nothing to take a job how about this for you oh this is lip balm virgin and flood music perfect Christmas what do you think about this Miguel I actually love it come together very well my name on an epic Isis I think I'm not letting it go how about money - vodka [Laughter] I'm having a really good for me dated a little exercise a lot of pampering and some delicious food I've got a roasted tomato basil soup cooking away on the stove and I'm going to make an absolutely guilt-free lemon angel food cake so here I have sifted together 1 and 1/3 cups of cake flour and 1/2 a cup of superfine sugar the cake flour is going to make this a really light cake but the basis of this cake is one and a half cups of egg whites I'm going to beat them with 3/4 of teaspoon salt and one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar and I'm going to let that beat until they get really firm there are two main flavors you just Anila and freshly grated lemon zest so first thing I'll do is the lemon zest this gives it a really fresh lemon flavor so that's one and a half teaspoons of grated lemon zest and three-quarters of a teaspoon of vanilla they use really good vanilla extract this is what you want them to look like really firm so that when you take the whisk off they actually stand up by themselves that's perfect and now I'm going to add one and a half cups of superfine sugar beaten into this this is what's going to make the cake so light great so remember I have 1 and 2/3 cups of sifted cake flour and 1/2 a cup of superfine sugar and I'm going to fold it in with the spatula so what I'm going to do is I'm going to sprinkle this over the cake next and just fold it in carefully the other wonderful thing is this cake is so we're going to make so it's just folding this in to make sure it's incorporated and I'm going to put it in my pan this is a tube pan and it's what angel food cakes are classically baked in and you don't want to grease it because it will stop it from rising and it has a hole in the middle so that the heat can get into the middle and it bakes evenly I'm just going to pour this whole thing right into a tooth pan through the top and then put it in a 350 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes and it's going to be the delicious [Music] I've got a really healthy day and now I'm making myself a really healthy sandwich so I've got 8 ounces of low fat cream cheese and 10 ounces of Montrachet which is a low fat goat cheese I'm just going to mix that up and then I'm going to add all kinds of delicious things I've got fresh garlic chopped up and put it right in just because it's low-calorie doesn't mean it has to be bland I like lots of flavor and lots of fresh thyme to be really good enough that happens teaspoon of thyme and then 3 tablespoons of chopped parsley great install and pepper and just to make it a little thinner I'm going to hit it with a little milk so being at my bread delicious I love bread like this that's really dense and has a wonderful flavor it's got seeds and nuts in it so a little spread of herb goat cheese and since likes cucumber fresh parsley and this is going to be really good with my rest of tomato basil soup this is my delicious and healthy roasted tomato basil soup all I did was rest tomatoes together through them lots of fresh basil simmered it I'm going to do is puree it I know this looks like a contraption that came down from Mars but it's a it's called a food mill and it's just wonderful because as opposed to making baby food out of something it actually just pureed it with lots of texture one of the great things about the soup is I can serve it room temperature the way I'm doing it now but you can also serve it hot or cold with the dollop of yogurt or if your being dead creme fraiche it's like an early food processor okay that's it I'm not arrested tomato basil soup so supper in front of a good movie it's one of the great pleasures in life I third goat cheese sandwich little roasted tomato basil v and I'm ready for a great movie I'll come back later for dessert we'll be intermission I came back for my guilt-free lemon angel food cake it's a cake but it's so good for you it's just egg whites and lemon zest little vanilla and this is light as a feather and delicious nice big slide mm promise of Chelsea [Music]
roasted trunk doors I was great dish for crowd best part of it is the longer it sits the better against so it's Chris I'm doing throw some shrimp a little olive oil salt and pepper it's actually surprising way to cook shrimp on a sheet pan in the oven I just find it really gives it more flavor it's 2 pounds of shrimp about 32 shrimp okay into the oven high temperature 400 degrees for exactly six minutes and they're going to be really delicious and succulent and I think the orzo is just about ready so I took three quarters of a pound of orzo in boiling salted water deflesh of a whole alone good and hot whoa okay that's great we're going to go right into a big bowl so I'm going to grab the first thing I need it has a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice and I have a cup of olive oil [Music] this is all 1 teaspoon of pepper it'll whisk it all together and just pour it right over the pasta I'm going to cut up some herbs and vegetables with salad so first thing I need is a cup of chopped galleons and then I'm just going to run my knife right down the middle ok just rough chop the scallions and later red onions are going to give this lots of sharp flavor right into the salad next thing is cup of freshly chopped parsley the show I use flat leaf parsley I think that's my flavor but it's get curly parsley it's just fine right in that one cup of chopped fresh dill so I'm going to chop it roughly now it's really important to use fresh herbs especially when it's a salad like this but if you have some leftover and you want to chop it up just put it in little containers freeze it and then just to frost it when you need it okay one cup of dill right into the salad next thing is to cumbers so just run it down the middle and just do the cubes right into the salad I have a cup of diced red onion into it I just wanted to flavor the salad okay the next thing is the surest you get perfectly cool [Music] okay get all the flavor in so toss it all together and then the last thing one of my favorite ingredients good feta and just put it in as gently as possible so it doesn't get all broken up toss it in it's perfect for sitting on the dock watching the boat contemplating life
[Music] one of my dearest friends Patricia wells is coming for the weekend she's an incredible cookbook author actually we have such a good time together my husband Jeffrey is always threatening to send the fun police after us what's amazing about Patricia particularly is over the last few years she's gotten very fit she's lost 40 pounds let me tell you I'm impressed so we're gonna have a weekend of good food and healthy living and we're gonna be great time together my friend Patricia is coming after a really long trip from Paris and I thought wouldn't it be nice to just greet her with like big steaming bowls of chili but since she's being really good I thought maybe I instead of making beef chili I'd make chicken chili so I've got about four cups of onions and two tablespoons of olive oil and they cooked until you can really smell them about ten minutes and I'm gonna have lots of good stuff two tablespoons of chopped garlic this is gonna be really good want to cook garlic for just a minute so it doesn't get really bitter and two yellow peppers and 2 red peppers this is a really quick way to cut peppers just straight down and then what's left over you can use for snacking and I'm just going to big chunks that chili should be big chunks of good stuff so peppers good thing about chili is you can make it days in advance and it's just delicious in fact it's even better so the flavors blend together so well how does a big party stew lots of vegetables chicken okay now all the good spices first thing of course is chili powder so I've got he's for chili powder teaspoon of cumin which is a really essential ingredient all Chili's and then these are the things that make it hot red pepper just sort of a pinch of it maybe quarter teaspoon and then cayenne pepper which is really hot so use it at your own risk I like when things have a lot of flavor and a little bit of heat but if you like it really hot just add more okay then lots of salt it's really critical for bringing out the flavor and the spices so two teaspoons of salt this is great and I'm gonna cook that for about a minute while I get the tomatoes ready show you about the tomatoes I always with canned tomatoes life's too short to peel a tomato so just go chop them up really quickly put in two 28-ounce cans of tomatoes try not to get it all over the kitchen like I do give this stirrer so most chili has cilantro in it but I personally hate cilantro so I'm gonna put basil in instead it gives it great flavor just take the leaves off I'll just give it a really rough chop so maybe about a quarter of a cup should be good I'm different so it's gonna cook for about 30 minutes chicken smells like it's just about done you can tell when the chickens done when springs back when you touch it oh that's hot do you think this is enough chicken for Patricia and me so I'm gonna let that cool I'm gonna add to the sauce and Patricia and I are gonna have two wishes chicken chili my first role of overnight gas is only invite people you really love so I want to make them incredibly comfortable so they stay for a long time first things fly just one big buzz of tulips one color it's really simple and it's gorgeous and I know we're being good but chocolates on the pillow it's really important [Music] and a great bathroom with lots of little beauty treats great soap I don't know about you but I always forget my toothbrush and toothpaste and I always like to have nice fragrances for her she can try them all out and some bath gel and body lotion and it's Patricia's home away from home [Music] already it smells so good I can smell it all the way upstairs all the flavors and everything's cooked perfectly so now I'm gonna add the chicken it's not so hot anymore so this is a chicken that I cooked on the bone with the skin on it and it really keeps it moist I just tested all different kinds of ways of doing this and I found it's so much better roasting it than it is to boil it with the way you normally do it for a chicken like this Patricius on a book tour for her new book Provence and I can't wait to see it so just sort of tear off the bone with your hands it's the best way to do it so big chunks I want it to be really delicious and chunky right into the pot I'll just stir it around just gonna cook for about 20 minutes all the flavors get into the chicken and chili and cumin basil tomatoes [Music] and that's the topic it's a good part of the Chile and you may get few that are really good for you and a few that are naughty good sharp cheddar sour cream good salty corn chips so I just want to really rough great on the cheddar that should be enough for the two of us Saturday knife is really great for cutting Tomatoes your fingers and a quarter [Music] good sour cream for anybody wants to be really naughty lots of red onions toppings are done and now all I knew is Patricia the fun okay let's say you're in charge of choking great let's set the tables all set Oh beautiful got chicken chili Wow really hot oh I don't know what time zone you're in but I hope you're right curry I know - it's a very honored dishes ok good ok and let's have fun so we got all kinds of toppings cheese a little sour cream yeah sour cream some chips did you just create this like in the shower healthier if I made chicken chili so I just particularly instead brilliant it's been been one of Jeffrey's favorites I'd say we're gonna have to stay one step ahead of the fun police I agree I know it looks like Patricia and I are having martinis for breakfast we're not not a bad idea but today I'm gonna make her very berry fruit salad and put it in martini glasses so I'll have something great and love Patricia's recipes they're really easy and they're really delicious so this is three berries and I'm gonna marinate it in balsamic vinegar with a little mint on top so this is totally flexible recipe you can make it for two you can make it for 50 and because it's marinating you want to sit a little bit in the fridge so but since it's just for two I'll juice like half a pint of strawberries half a pint of raspberries don't never wash raspberries because they absorb water and half a pint of blueberries just make sure they're good with what before they go in there great fantastic okay and then the sonic vinegar this is really great balsamic vinegar is vinegar that's aged in oak barrels and it has great flavor and it's like great wine the longer it sits the better it is this is a really old balsamic vinegar and it's like syrupy it's sort of like the consistency of maple syrup and it's just great so just one tablespoon on all these berries looks so good quarter of a cup of sugar just to sweeten it up a little bit I don't me do a little less toss it all together you have to admit that was pretty easy and then I'm just gonna let it sit for a little bit and the vinegar and the sugar is going to draw some of the juices out of the berries so into the glasses perfect we're gonna ride him out to Patricia good morning help yourself to fruit salad and anything else do it and I'm off to the grocery store [Music] look at all these flowers are incredible really hard for me to pass up arms to us but I'm gonna have to focus I'm here for herbal iced tea [Music] - left me notes saying I'm a charge in the kitchen so I'm gonna make a dessert for tonight one of my favorite desserts yogurt sorbet which is a very very simple recipe it starts with three egg whites that we're gonna beat slowly for about a minute until they're frothy and then we're going to add slowly add 2/3 cup of sugar letting it get a little faster [Music] I think I'm gonna have a little bit of breakfast first I love this kind of stuff left over here's the tea let's see what would be good ginger a red zinger would be good and I think lemon zinger together would be fabulous I'm using low-fat yogurt here three cups of yogurt and France would actually use something called fromage blanc which is very similar a little more tangy flavor Oh apple juice that would be good instead of sugar and then we're just gonna fold this in so of course if you're pregnant or elderly or have some fragile issues you probably don't want to use we're all egg whites just keep a little bit of air in there Garcia I'm doing great I'm 80 I love easy desserts like this [Music] okay I'm just gonna make a note to ina to turn off the machine in about thirty minutes and let her know that I'm off to the fish market there's a note turn off the machine I can do that oh she's got something going on here oh this looks like your yogurt survey I've never tasted it makes your mind so good it's like frozen yogurt yeah okay into the container I bet it was easy to knowing Patricia's recipes for a meal but I don't it doesn't get settled until I go to the market and see what's fresh because there's nothing nothing nothing worse than saying oh I want salmon and the salmon doesn't look very good so we'll see what we find at the market [Music] into the freezer and I think there might be some berries left over for breakfast and there are mmm that's my breakfast I love when Patricia comes to visit we have such a good time cooking and shopping who knew balsamic vinegar and berries could be so good together [Music] look at these crap beautiful meat herbal iced tea it's delicious and it's good for you how unlikely is that so it's really simple I'll show you it's for red zinger tea bags two four four lemon zinger tea bags two for my husband and I had a drink like this and asked him we were skiing once it raised home to make it and I'm just gonna pour hot water in so I'm just deep this for about 10 minutes and I'm gonna mix it with apple juice it'll be naturally sweetened it would be just delicious really special I got some real nice double up that is gorgeous you don't have a great recipe for crab selling so I think I'll take a pound of that [Music] that's great perfect necessary today wonderful okay over here up front okay that's a great choice [Music] okay this should be steep enough I'm just gonna fix the tea bags out I always make sure I get a lot of this team made everybody loves it okay apple juice don't even have to measure heads apple juice [Music] that's it that's gonna be good with dinner Wow look at all that crab meat thank you guys you didn't pick it yourself okay as opposed to usual you're the boss of me now I do a prep for you you want to set this line okay and I like to use this ester just right into the right answer they're ready to bear and then we're gonna juice it and we're gonna add some mayonnaise maybe a little salt to taste we'll see how that goes and I thought we'd also do a Shifa not a mint to go in there without end I'll show you why I like to do a sheikh fahad there's a 20 okay baby I can have that and juice that okay then I'll start out Italian aise all right I'm gonna juice these I'm gonna have another feast tonight oh this is unbelievable crab meat wobbly overboard yeah I would add all that cuz I think this is so nice it's wonderful because it makes it really fresh - it's not great yeah so let's do the Shifa nod okay the way I like to do it okay we'll take about four or five leaves like what is this in for Tricia I know what you do is you roll it up like a cigar yeah nice and tight and then just the nice okay that's great you have any green herbs isn't that great basil and mint and that's it and that's it this is really easy it's all we have to do is mount it on the plate I think I need to taste it though don't leave it any good I don't know I'm not so sure that lovely no it's wonderful the mint and the lime it's just all the dozens I got the cramp hey you know what I love about visuals like that when you're looking at it they're so similar if you don't know what's gonna go in your mouth so then it's likes to surprise a little bit of lime a little bit missus right how about you put it on the plate um and if everyone know people are gonna think all we ever do is sit around and eat are they wrong a little mint maybe a slice of lime and I would say dinner served Ryan terrific a little herbal iced tea to go with it that what do you feel great I love you why'd you bring now yogurt sorbet right oh it looks so good lovely I might have tasted it while it was still in the machine did you really yeah I might uh oh that's great it's like the perfect texture so good yummy so refreshing thank you for teaching man and make this I'll be making anyone and this is so light I know but why do I think we're gonna be at the refrigerator later so good but this smells great okay cinnamon sugar for you right oh yeah and if you don't sit down at your table it doesn't count right that's right [Laughter]
[Music] I've been working really hard and I need a day off so I asked my friends Don a carpenter and Antonio Bellanca to come play with me I'd made us a quick breakfast in the garden and for later a light lunch in between I think there's gonna be a lot of shopping this is gonna be really fun for breakfast making a sour cream coffee cake that's drizzled with real maple syrup and a sunrise smoothie to go with it made with fresh watermelon strawberries mango and some raspberry sorbet and for lunch I'm making my favorite warm goat cheese salad that's light and tangy plus delicious grilled fresh peaches with crisp amaretti cookies great friends good food maybe a little gossip and lots of shopping this is my idea of a great day off first thing I want to make for Antonia and Donna is a sour cream coffee cake it's a really moist sour cream cake with a streusel in the middle I'm going to start with one and a half sticks of butter we're gonna have cups of sugar and I'm gonna cream that together until it's light and fluffy and then I'm gonna start on the dry ingredients okay so the first ingredient is cake flour cake flour I found it's a little lighter and fluffier so that's what I use two and a half cups of cake flour if you don't have cake flour you can use two and a quarter cups of regular all-purpose flour and a quarter of a cup of cornstarch two and a half great two teaspoons of baking powder [Applause] makes it nice and fluffy half a teaspoon of baking soda half a teaspoon of salt zip that together [Applause] okay so this is all nice and fluffy the sugar and butter I'm going to add three eggs I'm gonna add them one at a time I scrape down the bowl to make sure it's really well next no baking is one of those things it's really specific with cooking you can just throw stuff into the pan see how it is but when you're baking it has to be exactly the right ingredients and the right measurements okay it's a good vanilla really important in this morning to have teaspoons and one and a quarter cups of sour cream this is what makes it really moist one yeah got it all over the mix or two okay now I'm gonna turn on low lowest speed and just slowly add all the dry ingredients just with your hand and beat it just until they're really mixed okay last thing I always do is just mix the batter with a rubber spatula make sure really get the bottom sometimes the mixer doesn't get exactly the bottom and all the sides so I'm just gonna just stir it with a spatula make sure it's really well mixed it's not about beating it's just about folding it okay now for the streusel the good part so I'm gonna just combine it in a ball a quarter of a cup of light brown sugar half a cup of flour this is the crumbly part of the [Music] 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon quarter teaspoon of salt and three tablespoons of butter which I'm gonna just crumble into the streusel clean hands best tools so what's surprising to me how important salt isn't a recipe like this I think we always think of salt as a savory thing but for baking really brings out the flavor the cinnamon the brown sugar sour cream I don't have traditional walnuts are for a streusel cake but I'm gonna add some because I think turns up the flavor so that's requisite a cup of chopped walnuts you can just buy them already chopped if you don't like walnuts just leave that it's still delicious and just crumble all of that together okay now we put the cake together clear the decks a little I can really make a mess I always think creative cooks are not neat cooks so I'm gonna do this in a classic tube pan if you don't have something like this you can always use muffin pans it makes great muffins but I've buttered and floured this I'm gonna do is put half the batter on the bottom Oh smells so good I can really smell the vanilla in it the sour cream actually doesn't look like a lot in the pan but it really rises up so I'm just gonna spread it out with my spatula so it's even I'm going to take 3/4 of the streusel and just spread it evenly on the top of the batter so there's gonna be streusel in the middle of this cake as well as on the top I'm gonna take the rest of the batter put it on top I just want to place it on top and then I'll smooth it out later I'm so looking forward to seeing the Antonio and Donna we have such a good time together okay let's move this out and then more streusel on top it's amazing how much this gets really moist and great so into the oven 350 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes and we're going to have a really good cake [Music] so my philosophy is too much is never enough so I'm gonna add a maple drizzle to this to make it even better and it's really easy I have a cup of confectioner's sugar and two tablespoons of maple syrup I really like good maple syrup not the stuff that says syrup like Orser flavored or it's really Knable syrup and the best kind is gone grade-a amber that's sort of smoky flavor so it's not just sweet it has real depth of flavor this is pretty casual if it's a little too thin you can add a little more confectioner sugar if it's too thick you can add another drop of maple syrup or even warm water okay that looks just about right so it's runny but it's there and I think spoons gonna be the best way to do this so just take it and just drizzle it over the time it's a little thicker than I wanted and another drop [Music] okay that's perfect just like to drizzle down the side a little bit this is actually not about being perfect it's about being a little messy I'm next I'm gonna get a head start and dessert for lunch I'm gonna make grilled peaches with em already grilled peaches and amaretti it's a wonderful dessert to make ahead what I've done is brush them with a little bit of oil and I just grilled them for about three minutes until they get sort of a nice smoky flavor you can also do this outside under Grove but inside just fine and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to drizzle them with all different kinds of like amaretto rum vanilla sugar give it lots of flavor and then later before I serve them I'm gonna crumble amaretti cookies on top maybe even a dollop of creme fraiche that sounds good actually love the combination of the juicy peaches with a crunchy I'm already cookies it's a great flavor and texture combination I'll just work that perfectly okay now I'm gonna sprinkle them with vanilla sugar about a quarter of a cup I actually make this and I keep it in the pantry it's just a jar filled with sugar with a vanilla pod stuck in it I'm gonna take about a quarter of a cup you can really smell that wonderful vanilla flavor and just put it right on top of the peaches this is a great thing to make ahead because I want to serve them at room temperature that's when they have the most flavor okay the next thing we do is a quarter of a cup of amaretto that'll occur I'm gonna combine with the quarter of a cup of rum I like to use good dark rum mmm love always smells like the islands Caribbean rum drinks and then we're just going to drizzle this over the peaches and so that it really gets infused into the flavor of the peaches so good I'm just gonna put these in the oven 375 for about 10 minutes in the meantime doing with some great smoothies I'm gonna make sunrise smoothies to go with the sour cream coffee cake I think it's gonna be really good you can really make smoothies with all different kinds of combinations beckoning the flavors just right so the first thing I want to start with the strawberries I was like if something healthy with something decadent that a cup of strawberries cup of mango about one mango one make sure all the fruits really ripe and because you're blending it it doesn't matter what the pieces look like I'm gonna do a cup of watermelon obviously you can't buy a cup of watermelon so what I do is I just buy pieces and warnings you can always buy kind of watermelon when it's in season so a cup of watermelon it's gonna fit in and a little decadence cup of raspberry sorbet all smoothies need something to thicken them bananas are great in this case the raspberry sorbet is going to do it so one cup of raspberries are been okay and the last thing is a little orange juice at 1/4 of a cup [Music] perfect it's a mix of breakfast it's gonna blend it all up [Applause] just until it's really smooth and sunrise smoothies are ready he's gonna be so good with sour cream coffee cake [Music] okay have I got a treat for you Tony and for Donna Cheers girls day off this is just what we feel like doing absolutely nothing all right do we have energy for shopping all right we're out of here [Music] hey guys look at these okay great okay are you trying these on yeah I'm gonna go finish lunch don't get too much fun without me wonder what kind of trouble they're getting into but I'm gonna make a salad with warm goat cheese and the easiest way to slice goat cheese is with a piece of dental floss I'm gonna slice it about half-inch thick you can use a knife but this really makes a nice clean slice and I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a salad with a nice vinaigrette and then I'm gonna heat up these goat cheese slices just see how easy it is when it's like that now what I'm gonna do is dip these in a little bit of egg white and then some fresh breadcrumbs okay I'm just pull through her a second in the food processor this just makes the breadcrumbs adhere to it and then dip it into bread crumbs and then chill it for about 15 minutes and then after it's cool I'm gonna saute it and the bread crumbs are gonna get really nice and crisp and the goat cheese is gonna be really warm it's gonna be so good on that creamy vinaigrette this actually salad I had in a cafe in Paris with Jeffrey and I ran a home and made it again that's a good test of how good it is having a good time in town at such a lovely little town that's two blocks long that's really special I love East Hampton okay into the fridge I'm gonna chill them for about 15 minutes which gives me time to make a dress [Music] so while the goat cheese is chilling I'm gonna make the vinaigrette when he has two tablespoons of champagne vinegar 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar I think it's nice to mix them you get sort of the best of both worlds your salt pepper remember vinaigrette has to be really strongly flavored cuz it's gonna be tossed with all of that lettuce a little pinch of sugar really brings out the sweetness in it and a raw egg yolk actually if you don't want to use a raw egg yolk you can always use a little bit of mustard or a little bit of mayonnaise but I really like a rye oak and then I'm gonna pour very slowly pour olive oil in until it gets really thick and creamy the egg yolk will emulsify it about a cup of olive oil [Music] if you do it really slowly you'll see it sort of pulls together like a thin mayonnaise and then it'll really adhere to the lettuce leaves now okay that's perfect so now I'm gonna heat up a little butter and oil to saute the goat cheese so I'm gonna use about a tablespoon of butter a tablespoon of oil get the best of both worlds I have the flavor of the butter and the high burning temperature of the oil and I'm gonna get the goat cheese its chilling in the refrigerator [Music] just want to keep an eye on these guys so they brown nicely on both sides it's really fast just a minute on each side okay girls are gonna be here any minute I'll have to just finish the salad push up the grilled peaches I'm gonna have a wonderful lunch [Music] nothing like shopping to work up an appetite so I've got the nice mess bun mix creamy dressing toss it up [Music] let's taste it just to make sure it's really good doesn't it salt that's perfect a little bit of sweetness and the mescal mix is great because I find it kind of really interesting never mind it's already water so I don't have to wash it [Music] now that won't grow cheese I'm doing a side salad I would only do two but I think for a main course it's nice to have three this looks great it's a big salad but it's a main course so it should be this looks great nice pencil and warm goat cheese and lunch is ready okay Donna salad was warm goat cheese Antonia I know you're exhausted from a long day of shopping it's tough work but somebody's gonna keep up the economy of East Hampton honey I'm not that crazy about goat cheese but I love warm goat cheese there's something about the texture and you can do it with herb goat cheese too [Music] you guys ready for dessert okay talk among yourselves now all I have to do is finish up the grilled peaches with amaretto this is definitely my kind of day all playing no work so I've got the roasted peaches they've been grilled and then roasted with amaretto liqueur and rum this time already are wonderful they're little almond cookies that you can find in grocery stores or in Italian specialty food stores okay a little dollop of creme fraiche and everybody can serve themselves [Music] this can be wonderful dessert my heart [Music] so what do we think about girls stay off once a week that works for me is there anything we didn't eat today so I want to see what we got what we get I want this whoever bought it I want it look how great that is fabulous
[Music] roast chicken I can do this in my sleep so I want to just check the chicken for any leftover pinfeathers and I'm going to Pat it dry on the outside and I do that so that when brush it with butter and salt and pepper it will stick to it all the giblets have been taken out and say for another time so I'm just going to stand it up like this and just salt and pepper the inside chicken can sometimes be a little bland and so as much as I can do to give it lots of flavor I'm going to do so salt and pepper inside and then I'll show you my secrets and all you need to do is just take this whole lemon cut it in quarters and just stuff it in the middle I'm going to take this entire head of garlic cut it right in half so you can see all that little clove when it's inside the chicken it's going to be just like the hint of garlic and it gets into the juices in the vegetables in the pan it's so delicious and then I some fresh thyme and just stuff it right inside this great chicken now all I have to do is brush of butter on the top salt and pepper and it's ready to go want to melt the butter but not let it burn but it's actually better for this in olive oil the butter has some milk solids in it that burn a little bit so it makes the chicken nice and brown okay that's good so I'm going to brush the entire outside of this chicken gorgeous little chicken and then season it with salt and pepper I know it seems like a lot of salt but it's really important for the chicken to have lots of flavor and that will do it and pepper okay this is gorgeous now the next thing I do is trust it which is sort of to tie it up so that it cooks evenly one point of trust saying is if it's little legs are out like this the legs can very easily get burnt and the meat can get overcooked so what I want to do is pull it into its body so it cooks really well and I'll just all I have to do is title together and we'll do that you'll see they're all these very complicated ways to trust a chicken but this is about as easy as it gets so when to take a length of kitchen twine and just tie these little legs together and they leave long in so it's easy to take the twine off nobody wants to eat wine for dinner so just like that and then it's little wings just go under here just tuck them under the whole bird doesn't have to be wrapped in twine I've seen some birds that look like they're in bondage roast chickens just the best kind of comfort food and the good news is can be a really simple meal or can be really elegant one okay that's ready to go all right egg is ready I love when they are vegetable to the bottom of the chicken and they just soak up all this delicious chicken juices so I'm going to put carrots fennel and onions in the pan next thing is a drizzle of olive oil doesn't have to be exact just so that they get a little brown on the gross little salt little pepper and now I'm going to take the chickens so all the juices from the chicken are going to get into the vegetables and we'll all cook together it'll be so delicious so into the oven 425 degrees for about an hour and a half can't wait [Music] you
[Music] my friend Michael grooms having a really hectic day today so I've invited him for dinner tonight this is the time for good old-fashioned comfort food Michael actually grew up in a farm in Pennsylvania I understand as long as it's fabulous but I want to make it sour cream mashed potatoes I peeled them and cut them in big chunks I put them in salted boiling water for maybe about 10 to 15 minutes okay next thing I want to do is heat up a little bit of milk and butter when you have cups of milk 6 tablespoons of butter and meanwhile I'm going to get the potatoes pureed so this is called a food mill you can really find it in a hardware store or any kind of a cookware store and it's not very expensive so I'm just going to put the potatoes in I'll show you how to do work so you just turn the blade and you can turn it backwards just to clean the blade and then turn it again see how light and fluffy it is at the bottom you can use any kind of boiling potatoes Yukon Gold which are a little yellow which these are are the best one done okay I'm just going to whisk this into the potato just do it slowly don't do all of it at once I want to make sure that you have enough so that's creamy but not so much that it's soupy no potato soup okay now for a little depth of flavor better half a cup of sour cream two teaspoons of salt the better half a teaspoon of pepper this is really good Michael's gonna be very happy camper [Music]
[Music] my life's gotten so busy that sometimes it's hard to find a day to just test recipes but today's the day I've got some ideas I've two classic recipes that I want to update and a soup I've always loved this is definitely my kind of day first I'm taking my classic strawberry scones and seeing if there are other flavors that would make it even better next a wild mushroom lasagna using local mushrooms and finally a shrimp bisque that's as delicious as the classic one it's so much easier to make this is gonna be really fun a couple of classic Barefoot Contessa recipes that I'm always trying to improve on and one of them is scones I'm gonna start with four cups of flour all-purpose flour need 2 tablespoons of sugar you want them a little sweet but not really sweet two tablespoons of baking powder make them light and fluffy and two teaspoons of salt they have lots of flavor so let's combine that in the mixer okay now I need some butter the key to really light flaky scones is the butter it's really important that it's very cold when the heat of the oven hits the butter in the scones the water evaporates and the steam puffs them up okay into the flour mixture just turn on the mixer on low I'm just gonna mix it until the butter isn't like pea-sized pieces okay in the meantime I'm gonna get the eggs and the cream ready so I need four extra-large eggs it's best if they're cold so they don't make the butter warm and my cup of cold heavy cream it's gonna mix the eggs and put them right into the cream so I'm just gonna pour that creaming the eggs right in it's gonna be a really wet dough but the wetter it is the more moist that scones are perfect don't over mix it so I need 3/4 of a cup of dried strawberries the classic is raisins but I barefoot we used to do them with dried strawberries I'm gonna start with that and then see if I can make variations of it if you can't find them you can always use raisins or cranberries some kind of dried fruit is really good okay let's go put this right in okay I'm gonna mix it with a tablespoon of flour so it stays well distributed in the mix okay into the mix now I wonder what else I can add to this [Applause] can't tell you how many times I find myself in the pantry looking for inspiration so I want something that would go really well with scones salted peanuts yeah roasted cashews Geoffrey already ate them what else honey I make them too sweet currants already did that one no I think we'll nuts chocolates too sweet I think walnuts is it Oh Marge that might be good to actually walnuts and oranges that says breakfast right so I'm gonna chop up some walnuts I'm gonna Bowl maybe some orange zest just do it right over the bowl and then I'll flour these and I think I'll make two kinds of scones I'll make the plain strawberry ones and then I'll make the ones with strawberries orange and we all nuts then I can see which one I like the best so I'd say this is about third of a cup of walnuts and a tablespoon of orange zest I need a little bit of flour maybe a bad another tablespoon I'm gonna roll out half of them playing see give lots of flour it's really stinky I'm going to Pat it out that's 3/4 of an inch thick and I like to use a square cutter and it can really be any size cutter it can be around when it can be square one I like to make triangles out of a big square okay so those are plain ones and I'm gonna add the walnuts and orange zest see that's even better actually see the butter and I can see the car exists looks good roll it out to about 3/4 of an inch [Music] I think I'll bring into the office and see what everybody here thinks okay that's enough we're tests these are the new ones let's go cut these in triangles that's the experimental wall not an orange tray and now for the traditional ones with just strawberries so we can use that as a control test okay egg wash just a little beaten egg white with a little milk or water just makes it nice and brown on the top sprinkle of sugar to make it look good [Music] into the oven 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes I think I know which one I'm gonna like best I'm curious which one they like okay Susanna and Shinae there that's it I think I like the one with the walnuts better definitely I really are yeah better okay I think it's the orange scones with walnuts right I'm fantastic okay my next challenge is I'm going to take classic lasagna recipe make wild mushroom lasagna what do you think what sounds delicious okay hey you guys want to come for lunch yeah those make lasagna with turkey sausage which is perfectly fine but I thought wouldn't it be nice to make it with wild mushrooms and I heard about a wild mushroom farm somewhere around here I think that sounds delicious [Music] look at these mushrooms they're amazing nice shiitakes I just bet he's awful logs in the back oh they're gorgeous actually I need one and a half pounds of mushrooms I usually make a turkey lasagna and I want to make it with wild mushrooms well so I since you're the wild mushroom ma'am so what are these guys what I have here are some some blue oyster mushrooms named blue for the color but uh waster mushrooms because of their shape just like a moister oh yeah then what are these guys these are the King oyster 's they call him a king because it's kind of the king of the oyster mushrooms got a nice firm texture and nutty flavor and you know a nice calico cream-colored cat are they different in flavor they're gonna be a little more rich a little stronger like nutty flavor almost if mushrooms can be nutty and these will be a little more mild and tender I think that's perfect to do a banana perfect okay great he's often thank you please look amazing I can't wait to make the lasagna [Music] I guess so much day my voter I did it would be doing well no matter what kind of lasagna I'm testing you have to start out with a lasagna noodles so I have a big pot of boiling water olive oil make sure they don't stick together salt that's 3/4 of a pound of lasagna noodles gonna boil them for bet at 8 to 10 minutes just until they're done so the first thing I'm gonna do for the mushroom lasagna is a bechamel or white sauce it's really kind of a classic for lasagna so the first thing is I need butter I won't stick of butter just melt that over medium heat and what I've got is I've got a quart of milk that I'm heating up I need to have a cup of flour it's gonna put it right into the butter just dump the whole thing in just gonna cook it for just a bit a minute okay just gonna pour the milk in all at once it's gonna make a really thick white sauce so needs some seasonings tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper and nutmeg quarter of a teaspoon of fresh nutmeg I'm just gonna keep stirring this so just thickened it happened so fast I only want to keep an eye on it its thickens too fast you can just whisk it until it's smooth I'd say that's perfect okay next to the mushrooms big saute pan okay time to slice the mushrooms so I'm gonna do this in two batches cuz you don't want if there are too many mushrooms in the pan without steam instead of saute and they won't have as much flavor so just gonna slice these big slices if you can't find these mushrooms which are hard to find actually because they're really special you can use portobello mushrooms or porcini mushrooms or shiitakes are delicious it's amazing how many kinds of varieties there are okay salmon here two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of oil it'll just help them Brown a little bit and just has so much more flavor when they're sauteed into the pan on the cookies for five minutes and then another batch for five minutes nothing written to assemble the lasagna [Music] so the first thing to do is pour some white sauce on the bottom of the dish they're about three or four layers of this I'm gonna put the sauce and zhonya noodles and the mushrooms with lots of Parmesan cheese in the middle okay so the next thing is lasagna noodles just fit them in loosely doesn't have to be perfect they're hot they're really hot and if you have to cut them to fit that's fine okay more sauce just enough to bind it all together it's a really elegant kind of lasagna looks great as a main course for a vegetarian but it's also nice if you want to do a roast and a little bit of lasagna to go with it so about a third of the mushrooms and this is a good part Parmesan cheese about a quarter of a cup of Parmesan cheese this is really gonna flavor it okay I'm gonna do it again more lasagna more sauce one of the great things about lasagna always is that you can make it in advance and then just bake it before dinner okay more mushrooms what parmesan one of the Sonia noodles [Music] spring them okay into the oven 375 degrees 45 minutes it smells delicious the proofs gonna be in the tasting [Music] perfect timing I do it here I had it I know it was lasagna you'd show up all right this is the test all right I mean you know you never know it's a mushroom lasagna how's this is that a big enough taste what do you think got the mushrooms from that wonderful guy in Bridgehampton who has mushroom farm oh it smells pretty good actually delish you never know you never know though okay go for it so creamy puppet mmm this is delicious thank you mmm good what's the spice ina oh it's nutmeg Jase yeah just a burnt hand - okay I'm the worst critic I love us mmm well he tastes fantastic - Lohan food one of the things I've learned when I'm recipe testing is write it down immediately because by tomorrow I've totally forgotten what I've done so I would say the strawberries comes for a success everybody like them including me with orange zest and walnuts so just when we thought something was perfect the way it was it can be even better and the wild mushroom lasagna that was a surprise I actually really like lasagna with meat in it but the mushrooms are so meaty who needs me it was just wonderful [Music] sure bisque I love it but every recipe I've seen is really complicated I decide I'm gonna see if I can make a really simple version that's just delicious I bought fish stock and I've added the shrimp shells to it to give it even more flavor I'm gonna strain the fish stock I need 3 and 3/4 cups so if I have a little less I'm just gonna have some water yep just a little water okay so first thing I've done here is sauteed two cups of leeks and three tablespoons of olive oil just make sure the leeks are really really clean before you cook them okay I'm gonna add some garlic got a tablespoon of garlic just saute it for about a minute actually love shrimp bisque I like that rich shrimp flavor and a little bit of sherry so the next thing I need is a little bit of cayenne pepper just a pinch not too much you don't want to overpower the shrimp and just cook that together okay and then a pound of shrimp this is where the shells came from and just cook the shrimp for about three minutes until they're just perfectly pink and just tender and the shrimp's cooked I'm gonna add the rest of the ingredients and have a really rich delicious shrimp [Music] well I can't make good shrimp bisque with that sherry but I've actually decided little cognac would help the two so I want to start with a quarter of a cup of cognac it's gonna pour it right into the shrimp and leeks better cook from it and that smells good and a quarter of a cup of dry sherry and all that's just gonna really get into the shrimp and flavor the soup now that smells like shrimp bisque shrimp and sherry so classic look I'm gonna puree this now just put it right into the food processor and now I'm just gonna puree until it's really chunky I don't like it when it's too smooth [Music] okay that's perfect and now I'm gonna make a white sauce that's gonna be the base of the soup this white sauce is really the same kind of white sauce I made for the lasagna I'm starting with half a stick of butter and a quarter of a cup of flour I'm gonna cook it over medium low heat for about a minute just to cook the flour then I'm adding two cups of half-and-half who's gonna stir this until heaven half gets hot and it thickens with the flour so far it's been pretty easy okay the next I'm gonna put in is the pureed shrimp and leeks really smells good can smell the cognac and sherry that's my have so much flavor the fish stock three and three-quarter cups third of a cup of tomato paste two teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and that's it just gonna stir it up and just let this simmer all the flavors are gonna go together it's gonna be rich and delicious I hope hmm so good classic taste half the time I'm happy it was a good day now I wonder what else I can add to this can't tell you how many times I find myself in the pantry looking for inspiration so I want something that would go really well with scones salted peanuts yeah roasted cashews Geoffrey already ate them what else honey I'll make them

chop up some walnuts in the bowl maybe some orange zest let's do it right over the ball and then I'll flour these and I think I'll make two kinds of scones I'll make the plain strawberry ones and then I'll make the ones with strawberries orange and we all nuts then I can see which one I like the best I'd say this is about third of a cup of walnuts and a tablespoon of orange zest and a little bit of

if you want to do a roast and a little bit of lasagna to go with it so about 1/3 of the mushrooms and he's a good part Parmesan cheese about 1/4 of a cup of Parmesan cheese this is really gonna flavor it okay I'm gonna do it again more lasagna more sauce one of the great things about lasagna always is that you can make it in advance and then just bake it before dinner okay more mushrooms more parmesan one lasagna noodles spring him okay into the oven 375 degrees 45 minutes smells delicious the proofs gonna be in the tasting [Music] perfect timing I do it here I had it I know if it was a lasagna you'd show up all right this is the test I mean you know you never know it's a mushroom lasagna how's this is that a big enough taste what do you think get the mushrooms from that wonderful guy in her champion who has mushroom farm oh it smells pretty good actually delicious in heaven you never know though okay go for it so creamy oh good mmm kisses delicious thank you mmm good what's the spice ina oh it's nutmeg today's yeah just a bird hand turn okay I'm the worst critic well I love it oh no bear was owned well he tastes fantastic do lohan food one of the things I've learned when I'm recipe testing is write it down immediately because by tomorrow I've totally forgotten what I've done so I would say the strawberries comes for a success everybody liked them including me with orange zest and walnuts so just when I thought something was perfect the way it was it can be even better and the one mushroom lasagna that was a surprise I actually really like lasagna with meat in it but the mushrooms are so meaty who needs me it was just wonderful [Music] sure bisque I loved it but every recipe I've seen is really complicated I decided I'm gonna see if I can make a really simple version that's just delicious I bought fish stock and I've added the shrimp shells to it to give it even more flavor I'm gonna strain the fish stock I need 3 and 3/4 cups so if I have a little less I'm just gonna have some water yeah just a little water okay so first thing I've done here is sauteed two cups of leeks and three tablespoons of olive oil just make sure the leeks are really really clean before you cook them okay I'm gonna add some garlic got a tablespoon of garlic just saute it for about a minute actually love shrimp bisque I like that rich shrimp flavor and a little bit of sherry so the next thing I need is a little bit of cayenne pepper just a pinch not too much you don't want to overpower the shrimp and just cook that together okay and then a pound of shrimp this is where the shells came from and just cook the shrimp for about three minutes until they're just perfectly pink and just tender and the shrimp's cooked I'm gonna add the rest of the ingredients and have a really rich delicious shrimp it [Music] well I can't make good shrimp bisque with that sherry but I've actually decided little cognac would help it too so I'm gonna start with a quarter of a cup of cognac just gonna pour it right into the shrimp and leeks but a cook permit and that smells good and a quarter of a cup of dry sherry and all that's just gonna really get into the shrimp and flavor the soup mmm now that smells like shrimp bisque shrimp and sherry so classic look I'm gonna puree this now I'm gonna just put it right into the food processor and now I'm just gonna puree until it's really chunky and I like it when it's too smooth [Music] okay that's perfect so now I'm gonna make a white sauce that's gonna be the base of the soup this white sauce is really the same kind of white sauce I made for the lasagna I'm starting with half a stick of butter and a quarter of a cup of flour I'm gonna cook it over medium low heat for about a minute just to cook the flour then I'm adding two cups of half-and-half who's gonna stir this is what happen half gets hot and it thickens with the flour so far it's been pretty easy okay the next I'm gonna put in is the pureed shrimp and leeks really smells good can smell the cognac sherry that's my have some good flavor the fish stock 3 3/4 cups third of a cup of tomato paste 2 teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and that's it it's gonna stir it up and just let this simmer all the flavors are gonna go together it's gonna be rich and delicious I mmm so good classic taste
[Music] so traditionally there are two problems with fried chicken one is all that grease and the second one is you have to do it just before you serve it I'm going to show you how to do the oven cells both those problems first thing you set up on this little rear end take your knife and there's a backbone here that I'm going to take out and you want to run your knife right along both sides of that backbone keep your fingers out of the way okay that's the backbone not great in fried chicken fabulous and soup so I'll save it for later so then you want to have a chicken flat out like this and there's this little part in the breastbone to Nick it with your knife and then run your fingers down both sides of this little bone and then pull it right out just should come out in one fell swoop okay and now it's really easy to cut up just run your knife right down the back flip it over cut the leg from the white meat cut the legs on the side pull it back it's easy to see where the bombs connect so we've got eight pieces ready for fried chicken and I'm going to put all the chicken in one bowl and I'm going to pour buttermilk over it and it's going to tenderize it the acid in the buttermilk really makes the chicken very tender and four quart of buttermilk over it this is good for two chickens but I only have one so what you want to do is get the buttermilk in around the chicken part okay wash up I'm going to marinate it for two hours if you have open eyes even better time to fry the chicken so family chicken is marinating in buttermilk which is gonna make it moist and really tender so first thing I'm going to season some flour to make the coating to make it really crisp to cut the flour 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of fresh pepper I'm just going to mix it all together and then put the chicken in so the secret of this recipe is instead of frying the chicken while everybody's standing there waiting for dinner I'm going to fry it really quickly get the coating really crisp and then I'm going to bake it in the oven so it's going to crisp on the outside and incredibly tender and juicy on the inside it's a messy job but really worth doing and ok last piece a really messy okay now let's get some oil really hot maybe oil about 360 degrees here's a candy thermometer which really hangs on the pot it gets almost there okay check it in just about three minutes on each side because remember we're going to finish cooking it in the oven it's browned on one side I want to turn them for another three minutes and then put them on a sheet pan to bake in the oven smelling like fried chicken now for the flour I just use salt and pepper because I like it simple but you can always be something spicy like cyan pepper whatever you like a little chili powder okay three minutes ready to come out and go on the sheet pan I'm going to fry the rest of these up then I'm going to put them all in the oven together 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until they're incredibly crisp on the outside and really to the inside
[Music] I'm making linguini with shrimp scampi it's a great summer dish I add oil the pasta pot so that the pasta doesn't stick together and salt for flavor okay that's going to cook for seven to ten minutes according to the directions on the package okay that's three tablespoons of olive oil and about three tablespoons of butter I do the olive oil because if it's a high burning temperature and the butter because it has lots of flavor I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce of the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than the flavor of garlic so one minute while I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is a peeled and deveined shrimp from the dish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein it yourself I'm going to add a pound of shrimp and just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor but garlic is going to give it to the shrimp so first I'm going to do a salt and pepper the shrimp or give lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also really strongly flavors just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides so good all that garlic and butter and oil how bad can that be Michael's so great with flowers I can't wait to see what he's doing at the table [Music] like hoping like this so just raining from draining the water from it and then it's going to go right into that pan with the shrimp and the garlic and butter and oil you can absorb all that great flavor okay just like that two spoons just toughed it all together it's actually a great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and themselves together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredients of lemon zest lemon juice I like a little bit of heat just sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and then two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to can't really see the lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people are going to eat them but they'll they'll see that it's lemon so I'm going to add a few slices of lemon to the whole thing for our finished off thing this is really great summer lunch
chocolate ganache cake is such a barefoot contessa classic we made it into wedding cakes for 600 people we've made it into individual ganache cakes but what everybody remembers most is the chocolate ganache cupcakes with a little candy violent on top so I thought it'd be really fun to do for the Barefoot reunion so to make it I start with quarter pound of butter room temperature very important and a cup of sugar it's got a secret ingredient I'll show you I'm gonna beat those together until they're light and fluffy for extra-large eggs I love speed add the eggs one at a time until they're well mixed in now comes the secret ingredient chocolate syrup I know it sounds odd in a cake but it's really good 16-ounce cam this recipe originally comes from my friend Devin Frederick's who owned loaves &amp; Fishes when she was like 25 years old she's an amazing cook 1 tablespoon of good vanilla extract and the last thing is a cup of flour just sprinkle it in slowly so it doesn't get lumpy and this is the point you want to mix in the flour just enough but don't over beat it otherwise it'll make a tough cake that looks really good it smells so chocolatey so this is enough for one eight or nine inch cake now I'm gonna make 12 cupcakes out of it so use it a muffin pan very inexpensive muffin pan for the from the hardware store and an ice cream scoop which gives you perfect cupcakes every time it's much easier to measure you want them almost filled they don't rise to much and then later after they cool I'm gonna do shiny chocolate glaze it's double chocolate double trouble so I'm gonna bake these at 325 for about 25 to 30 minutes everybody likes a nice chocolate cake but if the icing that everybody loves for my chocolate I gonna do it chocolate ganache icing just a shiny chocolate glaze really easy amazing so in a double boiler which is basically just a heatproof bowl over simmering water and put a half a cup of heavy cream half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate chips because I always like coffee and chocolate it gives a real depth of flavor a tablespoon of and some coffee granules something let that sit over simmering water until it just melts don't want to burn it stir it around the room so the ganache is still a little bit warm so it's easy to pour it's an amazing how shiny it is just gorgeous you can really taste that little bit of coffee and it really brings out the chocolate flavor can't imagine the big fats of ganache we used to make for chocolate wedding cakes with such an unusual wedding cake and I covered in fresh violets and white roses so beautiful big shiny chocolate wedding cake I have wonderful candied violets that we used to use that I put on each one edible violets these are sometimes a little hard to find but if you find a bakery supply store or specialty food store or cake decorating store something like that remember these get them with violates yeah
so what I have in this pot is I've sautéed some onions and garlic and then broken up some sausage that I got at the store this is turkey sausage you can get hot you can get sweet but I actually like to combine the two so it's half and half done pound and a half of sausage and it's all cooked in a little bit of olive oil then I'm going to add tomatoes a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes in puree if you use whole Tomatoes you can just put it in the food processor and crush them up yourself and a six ounce can of tomato paste the whole can I'm going to add laughs the flavoring some fresh basil just pick up some leaves and chop it up of course they still going to clip together anyway a love base I want to taste so good with tomato some turkey sausage doesn't have to be perfect okay so right into the tomato and turkey sausage and then I think some fresh parsley you can use flat leaf parsley like this or you can use curly parsley I think this has a little more flavor but really depends on the parsley right into the pot I think we need salt and pepper and 1/2 teaspoons of salt a lot of this depends on how salty and peppery the sausage is so you want to taste it 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper and then just stir it up I'm just gonna let it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes over low heat until all the flavors blend together in the tomato and the basil and the turkey sausage all taste like one okay now I'm going to get the cheese is ready I need 15 ounces of ricotta cheese which is usually 1 package and then put lots of flavours in it first thing is goat cheese I know it's unusual in a lasagna but I think it really gives a great flavor so this is a 4 ounce package we have a four and a half ounce packet or 5 ounce package keeps you casual about it just fine just crumble it right up into the ricotta sort of a little more punch and kind of flavor it's good 1 cup of grated Parmesan just mix that in and then one egg you know when you're putting an egg into a mixture I always put it into another glass bowl because you never know when you get a bad egg so one egg extra large egg just mix that in and then just going to add a little bit of flavor with some chopped parsley that 2 tablespoons of coarse salt and pepper you don't need too much because the parmesan is pretty salty quarter of a teaspoon of pepper just spread it out along the bottom of the dish mush it around just want to do one layer of pasta [Music] they don't have to be perfect just cutting the fit would take about half the mozzarella and layer it on top and then the next layer is this cheese the ricotta got half the cheese with the ricotta and goat cheese and Parmesan more sausage now kind of layer noodles normal Sorella Rikyu cheese amazing a fascist build-up and with nothing more strenuous to do than grate some parmesan over it and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes
I'm going to take two pounds of shrimp they're still in the shell I think they stay moister if you cook them in the shell and I'm pouring it into a pot of boiling water that's got lemon and salt in it and that will flavor it while they cook so the key to really good shrimp salad is to make sure that you don't cook the shrimp for more than three minutes it doesn't seem like a long time but if they cook for more than that it will definitely be overcooked what I'm looking for is to know that the shrimp are firm and hot and they're really done so I'm going to take them out and put them nice water stop the cooking immediately see how fast that was that almost wasn't even three minutes okay so now that it's an ice-water I can actually peel them right away so you take off the tail and then take off the shell and there's a little vein that goes right down the back of the shrimp that I want to take out just take it out with your knife that's done excellent so for the sauce it's a mayonnaise sauce but what I'd love to do with mayonnaise is thin it with some kind of flavoring I'm gonna start with one cup of mayonnaise I don't like that sort of gloppy mayonnaise thick mayonnaise taste so I always send it with something I'm going to do it with white wine just to my head in the fridge just tablespoon or so so that that's good that sort of a texture of it which is so much nicer than mayonnaise and then we're going to add all kinds of flavorings let's see how about some mustard let me have a teaspoon and salt once itself to be really well flavored because the shrimp are fairly bland and you wanted to really season this off nice pepper so we've got lots of fresh dill that I've cut up here so that's about three tablespoons of dill in there I'm just going to taste it and see how the sauce remember it has to be really highly seasoned because it's going to mix with the shrimp delicious got lots of flavor okay and then the shrimp I'm going to pour the sauce right over the shrimp took that all together and then I'm going to add some fresh vegetables some celery which is really traditional and some red onion which will give it a little spice are really good I'm going to put them one-and-a-half cups of chopped celery and I'm just going to use half an onion mix it all together so this looks great it's got a nice creamy dressing and all the fresh vegetables of celery and onions and the shrimp was dill perfect
[Music] fresh tuna tartare what'd you say this it's great when you go to the fish store to ask for fresh tuna ask for sushi grade too and you want to center cut piece and it shouldn't have any fishy smell at all so slice the tuna in quarter-inch slices and now I'm going to make quarter inch dice it's very small pieces but it's not really minced after I've marinated this in the lime juice marinade I'm going to add all kinds of flavorings and seasonings like scallions and chili peppers get a little heat and then I'm going to add diced avocados which gives a great flavor and texture so that's four and a half pounds of fresh tuna so now for the marinade you want to have cup of good olive oil okay when within one cup of lime juice don't even think about using the bottle cut that's a six fresh limes a lot of zest so it's going to give a lot of flavor tablespoon wasabi powder which is really really really hot Japanese horseradish generally don't use a tablespoon it's a lot of marinade next is soy sauce 3 tablespoons of soy sauce which is really the salt in it one and a half tablespoons of Tabasco which is more heat but remember it's a lot of tuna ok that's good salt and pepper that's two tablespoons of freshly ground pepper okay I'm just going to whisk back together it's really just like making it very spicy vinaigrette so pour it over the tuna just mix it together pretty good a riddle okay now I'm going to add some other great things 1/2 cups of chopped scallions lots of scallions quarter of a cup of chili peppers they're really hot that they're good mix those in now I need about 6 diced avocado right into the tuna just mix it in a little disc just make sure the lime juice gets to the avocado to keep from turning brown about two tablespoons of sesame seeds on top so it's really lots of Asian flavorings and seasonings in a little California avocados thrown in and then later after it's marinated at the party and we serve it on the cracker we'll let it marinate for about an hour in there frigerator just before everybody gets here I'm gonna make the tuna tartare it's amazing how the lime juice keeps the avocado from turning brown and it also cooks the tuna
today food is brought to you by Walmart find gifts groceries and more this season 841 we're back with today food and christmas has come early around here because the Barefoot Contessa herself Ina Garten is back her new cookbook cooking for Jeffrey is already a best-seller it's filled with her husband's favorite recipes and this morning we're making one of the ones at the top of his list ina nice to see you can I say something and I mean this and we've got tasters downstairs already we love all the chefs who come on this show yeah but you make us like Pavlov's dogs we hear your name we start salivating oh really you're just fantastic I'm always looking for remembered flavors but they taste better than you think so I think they're familiar it's not like octopus eyeballs with with a sauce or something why we're gonna get to the ingredients in a second why does Jeffrey like this dish so much it's chicken but it's got great flavor it's got lemon and onion and that becomes the sauce so it's just it's just a very simple dish and it's so easy to make it home what kind of herbs we talking about fennel thyme lemon onion garlic that's it that's it yeah but it's so good let's set the star thing I'm gonna do is make an urn herb oil I've got fresh thyme in here and I've got um fennel seeds a little salt and pepper lots of salt and pepper actually because you want to see isn't it and then I'm just gonna grind them together and put them into how does this little grinder work I know it I think that's the other way the other way when you know how to do this right okay go just brine them together and then just put them into this oil and we're gonna season the chicken with it so you're really not using the oil with yeah with great flavor and then that goes into the chicken okay are we marinating this chicken and we let it sit in this no we're good cooking in it okay absolutely so next thing is I have a skillet a black skillet which is great cast-iron and what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut up a lemon and put it right in the bottom just thin slice lemon like that so you can cook the chicken on top of the line top of this so we've got it's already done we've got the lemon the next thing I have is onion I'm just gonna put the limit onion right on top this is like so easy and garlic are you putting the garlic I know that's right let your finger smell like garlic and then I'm just gonna put the chicken on top so I'm get a whole chicken I've got a whole chicken and when I did was I had the butt butcher butterfly it so it's very easy to cook when it's like this so I'm looking at something are you gonna be able to get some kind of a crust on this chicken because all this is going to create steam isn't it it's well actually what's going to happen it's gonna create the sauce with the juices from the chicken and then it's gonna cook in a high temperature so it's gonna get really browned on top guys that's the key what do we think it's just like you said it's extra special it's so good and the broccoli rabe roasted broccoli crazy way to get to that okay I'm gonna make this herb oil and just brush it on the chicken okay butterfly side up yeah the bottom up and then I'm gonna turn it over I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do so then turn it over like this just right on top of the onions and the garlic do you need more of this on that side yeah are you in charge okay Pat it dry because that's the way you get browned if it's wet it'll just steam it's exactly what you said that's it just just brush it right on top and then this pan goes in the oven 450 degrees we're just really hot for 30 minutes and then I'm going to take it out and pour a little bit of wine I'm not going to do it now we're going to do it after 30 minutes around the pan put it back in the oven for 15 minutes and voila this is what it comes out look how does a pebble and it's way faster and it's like so easy to do so and the lemon and the onions become the sauce so except for the little blender here yeah we've done everything in one hand in one pan okay I think I'll mention the broccoli is just broccolini or broccoli rabe but I love and Brocklin I love to roast vegetables it's so simple all you do is olive oil salt and pepper into the oven high temperature just like that pepper I do squash like this I do tomatoes like this everything and how long's our smacking see under the heat how long for the last longer 20 minutes 30 minutes something like that until it's really brand and this is the way it comes out the chicken comes out like that right and the broccolini comes out like that all right you need a little nama know that you're tasting out so tender I can do it with my fork coated just in case I end up with a mouthful here will you read the tease I will but by the way this broccolini tastes like potato chips crunching brain it's delicious it's tender and that was a whole nail right yeah delicious meat a little testy yeah good all right part is going to be by the way with Kathy lien and myself a little bit later so we can't wait to see that not wait to see what I'm gonna make what are you making what is it King fresh fig preserve

[Music] every Friday night my husband Jeffrey drives three and a half hours to come home for the weekend and I always make him a roast chicken I'm going to surprise him tonight with a traditional Jewish dinner it's really easy to make and the house is going to smell just wonderful so here's my plan I make a traditional chopped liver appetizer but my wait cook with a little Madeira wine and a brisket pot roast simmered in tomato sauce piled high with carrots and onions quickly sauteed spinach with lots of garlic then melt-in-your-mouth regular cookies with cinnamon sugar apricot jam and raisins and nuts my only problem now is he's going to want this meal every Friday night it's Friday Geoffrey's coming home tonight just what is expecting yet another roast chicken I always like to shake it up a little bit so I'm making an old-fashioned Jewish dinner with brisket carrots onions to be really good well that's a big piece of meat for two people but it's like making beef stew it lasts forever and you can reheat it it's a big risk it for do people and I'll show you how easy it is I'm gonna make a rub for the top two tablespoons of salt I know it seems like a lot of salt but it's a big piece of brisket one tablespoon of garlic chopped up garlic two teaspoons of dried oregano and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper smoosh that all together and then rub it on top of the brisket okay that's appropriately smushed together I'm just gonna sprinkle it on the top and then rub it in briskets a great cut of stewing me to buy when you go to the store make sure you don't buy corned beef brisket which is the same cut but it's already been processed with spices and salt okay that's done I'm gonna put on a pound of carrots just chop them up in chunks it's gonna stew along with the beef I'll be really good these are big cats two pound of carrots can be anything from two big carrots to five small ones okay and then eight stalks of celery just cut off the ends a little bit the brown ends and then just cut it in chunks remember this goes to four three and a half hours so okay and onions I've got six onions sliced all over the top this already looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't it and some bay leaves for flavor these are beautiful bay leaves six how's that okay and then I'm going to pour good tomato juice all over the top of it just enough to come up about three-quarters of the way up the beef so just pour right on top and this is going to make the sauce after it cooks okay now we're just going to cover it and bake it so I'm going to cover it with aluminum foil but first because I don't want the foil to touch the tomato juice it reacts really badly I'll either cover it with plastic wrap or parchment paper [Music] into the oven 350 degrees for about three and half hours until it's fork-tender so that was pretty fast for dinner that could feed probably ten people but for tonight is just Jeffrey [Music] so tonight instead of a big dessert I thought maybe with coffee I'd make little cookies called rugelach they're made with cream cheese dough and really good vanilla so the first thing I'm going to do is make the dough and the reason why it's so delicious is 1/2 pound of cream cheese is the first ingredient so make the mixer half a pound of butter [Music] and court up a cup of sugar part of a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla [Music] two cups of flour [Music] this is wonderful - to cut measure just put it in slowly as it gets incorporated [Music] okay once the flowers in don't overmix it that's I end up with really tough pastry so this looks good [Music] dump the dough out make sure it's well mixed [Music] the keys to really light and flaky dough is to make sure it's well chilled before you roll it out and also before you bake so just pick a ball out of it it's good and sticky and because it's just two of us I'm gonna cut it up in quarters freeze three quarters of it and just make cookies out of a quarter for us and then I'll have pastry dough whenever I want to make cookies usually I put this in plastic wrap but little plastic bags work just as well [Music] okay one for the fridge free for the freezer and while it's chilling I'm gonna make a nice chopped liver [Music] well you can't have an old-fashioned Jewish meal without a little chopped liver a little massa selling to make chopped liver for Jeffrey for anybody who doesn't like chopped liver just think of it as like French pate it's really the same kind of thing so I've done this in two batches I have two pounds of chicken livers and I'm gonna saute them a little bit of chicken fat has to be chicken fat for chopped liver very quickly until they're just barely done you want them a little pink inside if chicken livers are overcooked they can be really dry with it okay these guys are done let's take them out as they're done okay now lots of onions more chicken fat I'm gonna put in onions and just saute them until they're caramelized and browned and just so sweet I've actually asked Jeffrey to run an errand and wonder what he's gonna come back with well I asked me to bring home some spinach and that might sound simple but I have screwed it up before I remember the time she asked me to bring back the cantaloupe and I brought back another kind of melon I thought it was a cantaloupe but it it was not a success so I approached this with a little apprehension oh this looks like a spinach this must be curly spinach and this must be baby spinach now get a bit of each just to play it safe all right you've got curly and you have baby okay great success yes so I'm gonna finish the chopped liver before Jeffrey gets back from his errand this is an unusual ingredient my chopped liver is Madeira it's a fortified dessert wine and it's a little sweet I had a third of a cup deglazes the pan and gets all those scrapings out I'm just gonna pour this right into the chicken livers this is a mixture that I'm gonna chop up later I may be chicken liver that anything tastes good with all those onions on it okay the next thing is for hard cooked eggs just gonna chop them up just roughly [Music] now quarter of a cup of chopped parsley it smells good rough chop okay two teaspoons of fresh thyme - two teaspoons of salt it's appropriate of kosher salt for this one teaspoon of pepper and I ask a pinch of cayenne to give it a little bit of heat and I'm gonna mix this in the food processor with more of the chicken fat just enough to make it the right consistency I'm going to chop it roughly you don't want to pureed that's pretty good I'm gonna chill it and then I'm gonna taste it when it's all chilled for seasoning make sure it has enough salt pepper this isn't Jeffrey's ordinary Friday night dinner [Music] I'm gonna chill it and it'll be ready for dinner tonight with a little matzo [Applause] so I think the briskets ready let's just check it out this is enough for two people for dinner [Music] brisket vegetables it's a whole meal in one check and make sure the meats done perfect should be fork tender but not like falling apart liked it take the meat out let it rest for a little bit and then I'm gonna boil the sauce down so it gets thickened okay cover this with foil I'm just going to turn the flame on yes so let's go to simmer away for about 30 minutes and now I'm going to finish the rug lock which that wonderful little cookie time to break the cookies so the rug Allah is a cream cheese dough and it's wrapped around a filling cinnamon sugar walnuts and raisins so walk up a wall ma chopped up six tablespoons of granulated sugar quarter cup of brown sugar half a teaspoon of good cinnamon [Music] 3/4 cup of raisins just mix that all together it smells so good how can that be bad it's the cream cheese dough that we refrigerated earlier it's nice and firm just want to roll this out to a 9 inch circle flour on my quatre I mean you're only something in a circle just go from the center to the outside don't roll back and forth I make a nice circle and try not to touch it so it doesn't get warm the colder it is the better the cookies will be the more flaky the dough is I'm going to spread it apricot jam I pureed it in the food processor so it's really fine it's really beautiful this cookie actually is great made with lots of different feelings whereas bear jams wonderful and sometimes it's even done in chocolate but I really like the traditional Africa so just a very thin layer of jam don't neglect the edges okay and now just mix up the filling a nice even layer all the way around okay press down the filling into the dough lightly and we'll make a mess okay now I take my knife and cut it in quarters [Music] okay then each quarter cut into thirds [Music] okay starting from them wider edge just roll it up towards the tip bend it a little so it's a crescent and just put it right on the cookie sheet lined with parchment paper okay just keep rolling them up and when you put it on the baking sheet make sure the little tips are down so that the heads down okay last one it's a really messy job but it's worth it the cookies are so good it's gonna chill them and I'll have nice and flaky Geoffrey should be home any minute now I'm just gonna get the chap liver ready for him you know just because it's chopped liver doesn't mean it can't be served in a

minute now I'm just gonna get the chap liver ready for him you know just because it's chopped liver doesn't mean it can't be served in a beautiful silver bowl so hi hi sweetie welcome home what'd you bring I get your kind of hmm you got two guys two kinds of spinach but it whatever kind you need hey what's that chopped liver oh I want that I don't want that why'd you bring me two tons of spinach well I figured that uh I think you get it - wrong man look it's two different community as opposed to the time you went up for a lemon or came back with a grapefruit yeah [Music] every Friday night my husband Jeffrey drives three and a half hours to come home for the weekend and I always make him a roast chicken I'm going to surprise him tonight with a traditional Jewish dinner it's really easy to make and the house is going to smell just wonderful so here's my plan I'll make a traditional chopped liver appetizer but my way cooked with a little Madeira wine and a brisket pot roast simmered in tomato sauce piled high with carrots and onions quickly sauteed spinach with lots of garlic then melt-in-your-mouth regular cookies with cinnamon sugar apricot jam and raisins and nuts my only problem now is he's going to want this meal every Friday night it's Friday Geoffrey's coming home tonight just when is expecting yet another roast chicken I always like to shake it up a little bit so I'm making an old-fashioned Jewish dinner with brisket carrots onions to be really good well that's a big piece of me from two people but it's like making these stew it lasts forever you can reheat it it's a big risk it for do people and I'll show you how easy it is I'm gonna make a rub for the top two tablespoons of salt I know it seems like a lot of salt it's a big piece of brisket one tablespoon of garlic chopped up garlic two teaspoons of dried oregano and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper smoosh that all together and then rub it on top of the brisket okay that's appropriately smushed together I'm just gonna sprinkle it on the top and then rub it in briskets a great cut of stewing me to buy when you go to the store make sure you don't buy a corned beef brisket which is the same cut Butz already been processed with spices and salt okay that's done I'm gonna put on a pound of carrots just chop them up in chunks it's gonna stew along with the beef will be really good these are big cats - patty carrots can be anything from two big carrots to five small ones okay and then eight stalks of celery just cut off the ends a little bit the brown ends and then just cut it in Chuck's remember this goes true for three and a half hours so okay and onions I've got six onions sliced all over the top this already looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't it and some bay leaves for flavor these are beautiful bay leaves six how's that okay and then I'm going to pour good tomato juice all over the top of it just enough to come up about 3/4 of the way up the beef so just pour it right on top and this is going to make the sauce after it cooks okay now we're just going to cover it and bake it so I'm going to cover it with aluminum foil but first because I don't want the foil to touch the tomato juice it reacts really badly I'll either cover it with plastic wrap or parchment paper [Music] into the oven 350 degrees for about three and a half hours until it's fork-tender so that was pretty fast for dinner that could feed probably ten people but for tonight is just everything so tonight instead of a big dessert I thought maybe with coffee I'd make little cookies called rugelach they're made with cream cheese dough and a really good vanilla so the first thing I'm going to do is make the dough and the reason why it's so delicious is 1/2 pound of cream cheese is the first ingredient so make it the mixer half a pound of butter [Music] and court up a cup of sugar part of a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla [Music] two cups of flour [Music] wonderful to to cut measure just put it in slowly as it gets incorporated [Music] okay once the flowers in don't overmix it that's I end up really tough pastry so this looks good [Music] dump the dough out make sure it's well mixed [Music] the keys to really light and flaky dough is to make sure it's well chilled before you roll it out and also before you bake so just pick a ball out of it it's good and sticky [Music] and because it's just two of us I'm going to cut it up in quarters freeze three quarters of it and just make cookies out of a quarter for us and then I'll have pastry dough whenever I want to make cookies usually I put this in plastic wrap but little plastic bags work just as well [Music] okay one for the fridge free for the freezer and while it's chilling I'm gonna make a nice chocolate her [Music] well you can't have an old-fashioned Jewish meal without a little chopped liver a little Massa ass I'm gonna make chopped liver for Jeffrey for anybody who doesn't like chopped liver just think of it as like French pate it's really the same kind of thing so I've done this in two batches I have two pounds of chicken livers and I'm gonna saute them a little bit of chicken fat has to be chicken fat for chopped liver very quickly until they're just barely done you want them a little pink inside if chicken livers are overcooked they can be really dry with it okay these guys are done just take the Matis they're done okay now lots of onions more chicken fat I'm gonna put in onions and just saute them until they're caramelized and browned and just so sweet I've actually asked Jeffrey to run an errand and wonder what he's gonna come back with [Music] well I asked me to bring home some spinach and that might sound simple but I have screwed it up before I remember the time she asked me bring back the cantaloupe and I brought back another kind of melon I thought it was a cantaloupe but it it was not a success so I approached this with a little apprehension oh this looks like a spinach this must be curly spinach and this must be baby spinach I'll get a bit of each just to play it safe all right you've got curly and you got baby okay great success yes so I'm gonna finish the chopped liver before Jeffrey gets back from his errand this is an unusual ingredient my chopped liver is Madeira it's a fortified dessert wine and it's a little sweet I had a third of a cup deglazes the pan and gets all those scrapings out I'm just gonna pour this right into the chicken livers this is a mixture that I'm gonna chop up later maybe chicken livers that anything tastes good with all those onions on it okay the next thing is for hard cooked eggs just gonna chop them up just roughly [Music] now quarter of a cup of chopped parsley it smells good rough chop okay two teaspoons of fresh thyme two teaspoons of salt it's appropriate to have kosher salt for this one teaspoon of pepper and I asked a pinch of cayenne to give it a little bit of heat and a mix this in the food processor with more of the chicken fat just enough to make it the right consistency we want to chop it roughly don't want to pureed that's pretty good I'm gonna chill it and then I'm gonna taste a little rug Allah for dessert how's that coffee it has a cinnamon of spice wow that's wonderful these good as your grandmother's well you know I love my grandmother but these are really I'm glad well

gonna want this meal every Friday night it's Friday Geoffrey's coming home tonight just what is expecting yet another roast chicken I always like to shake it
[Music] for twenty years and especially food store in the Hamptons called Barefoot Contessa I can't tell you how many millions of muffins we made or how many thousands of people worked for me today I've invited six people from the very early years to come for dinner I can't wait to see them I'm gonna make some classic different recipes that I know they're gonna remember I'm making barbecued ribs with the sauce we all develop together served with our famous Barefoot Contessa coleslaw updated with blue cheese and for dessert delicious chocolate ganache cupcakes that will send them all down memory lane we all worked hard together and we played hard together and I can't wait to see what they're all doing now barbecued ribs I can't tell you how many millions of pounds of these we've made at Barefoot Contessa in fact Martine who's coming today had a shop called bridge ribs ribs and guess what she made lots of them so what I'm gonna do first I'm gonna make the sauce and I'm starting with one red onion that's been sauteed two cloves of garlic a little bit of olive oil I'm just gonna cook them until the onion is tender about five minutes I'm gonna have lots of great spices 2 teaspoons of chili powder mmm smells great 1 teaspoon of cumin very tex-mex spice and for heat 1/2 a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes and then a few really unusual ingredients a tablespoon of grated ginger this is sort of a combination of tex-mex and Asian the zest of one lime that a teaspoon when I first made this sauce actually I tried all kinds of really specialized things one with tomato one with mustard one with Asian and then I found if I mix them all together I got a much more complex and interesting sauce so that was the sauce we used for years of every contestant so one teaspoon of grated lime says third a cup of apple cider vinegar soy sauce third of a cup the Asian part 1/2 a cup of tomato paste that's the text lunchbox [Music] have a cup of honey because of the nice sweet and sour taste two tablespoons of Dijon mustard and the last ingredient is a quarter of a cup of fresh orange juice [Music] so I'm just going to simmer this for about 15 minutes and let all those flavors really going together and then I'll cool it and use it as a marinade for the ribs I don't remind us all of those great ribs we used to have in Westhampton chocolate ganache cake is such a Barefoot Contessa classic we made it into wedding cakes for 600 people we've made it into individual ganache cakes but what everybody remembers most is the chocolate ganache cupcakes with a little candied violet on top so I thought it'd be really fun to do for the Barefoot reunion so to make it I start with quarter pound of butter at room temperature very important and a cup of sugar it's got a secret ingredient I'll show you I'm gonna beat those together until they're light and fluffy for extra-large eggs [Music] last one [Music] hello speed add the eggs one at a time until they're well mixed in scrape down the bowl to make sure you get well mixed [Music] [Music] now comes the secret ingredient chocolate syrup I know it sounds odd and a cake but it's really good 16-ounce cam this recipe originally comes from my friend Devin Frederick's who owned loaves &amp; Fishes when she was like 25 years old she's an amazing cook 1 tablespoon of good vanilla extract and the last name is a cup of flour just sprinkle it in slowly so it doesn't get lumpy [Music] and this is the point you want to mix in the flour just enough but don't over beat it otherwise it'll make it tough cake that looks really good smells so chocolatey so this is enough for one eight or nine inch cake but I'm gonna make 12 cupcakes out of it music a muffin pan very inexpensive muffin pan for the from the hardware store and an ice cream scoop which gives you perfect cupcakes every time it's much easier to measure you want them almost filled they don't rise to much and then later after they cool I'm gonna do shiny chocolate glaze it's double chocolate double trouble so I'm gonna bake these at 325 for about 25 to 30 minutes and now I'm going to go marinate the ribs they're gonna be great time to marinate the ribs please look great so I'm gonna put them in the platter meat side up the key about this is I'm going to take some of the rib marinade and set it aside first I don't want to use this dipping sauce any of the marinade that's touched the raw meat and okay the rest I'm just gonna spoon right over the ribs I'm gonna marinate this for as long as I can get as much flavor as possible into them a couple of hours overnight what as much time as you have marinate them in the refrigerator I did a lot of research on ribs when we were selling them at their free Contessa you can buy baby back ribs which I found just didn't have enough meat on them or you can buy spareribs which I think are too fatty these are something called country ribs they're not often carried by butchers but you can order them in advance and they're meaty and flavorful and just delicious [Music] I hear a commotion outside public tr [Music] well instead of booze in the flowers so some instant instant photos oh that's a great take pictures of each other don't see this like 20 years so you're in charge of the grill there's a little libation go like I can work on that [Music] why is it when I think about what the Samsun I think about champagne I think has we had a really good time put those glasses down all right here this is so you can do the grill and I'm gonna take my champagne and go finish the coleslaw how's that cheers so happy having here [Music] since your having a barefoot reunion i thought i'd do all classic recipes and coleslaw is definitely one of those but i thought i'd update it a little bit with blue cheese i'm going to show you how easy it is in a food processor just take the slicing blade put it on top put the cabbage in sideways so you get long shreds otherwise you get short ones how easy this back just keep putting more cabbage in the top and slicing you can't put it in sideways that's half a white or green cabbage pour that into a large ball and now for the red cabbage then the red cabbage goes right on top don't mix them in otherwise the red cabbage will make the white cabbage red just put right on top last thing is carrots I'm gonna grate them with a grating disc the top back on you don't use this very often but when you do it's really useful yes it's gonna come out shredded and just put that right on top now all the vegetables are ready and we make the sauce so the sauce we start 16 ounces of mayonnaise this makes a lot it's a great recipe for a crowd and that's what we're happened quarter of a cup of Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons of whole grain mustard 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar spoon celery salt it gives it great flavor at the teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of pepper together if you're making this in advance you can actually stop right here leave the vegetables and the sauce separate in the refrigerator for actually even a few days and then mix it before you in a server but since the party's today I can do it now just pour this over the whole thing we want enough sauce so it moistens it but not so much that it's wet and sloppy [Music] okay now I'm gonna add blue cheese and parsley I like Roquefort for this it's got a really sharp flavor so I'm just cut off the end the edge I'm gonna just chop it up and mix it in let's put it in I know there are those of you who think this smell smells like gym socks but it's really delicious now okay mix that in and the flavors are really blend as they sit okay the last thing is parsley just toss the parsley in mix it in it's done okay just gonna put that in the refrigerator that's gonna just get better and better as it sits [Music] next I'm gonna make chocolate ganache for the chocolate cupcakes everybody likes a nice chocolate cake but the icing that every people loves but my chocolates not gonna do it chocolate ganache icing with just a shiny chocolate glaze music so in a double boiler which is basically just the heat proof Bowl over simmering water and put a half a cup of heavy cream half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate chips because I always like coffee and chocolate it gives a real depth of flavor that I had tablespoon of and some coffee granules some to let that sit over simmering water until it just melts don't want to burn it around alone in the meantime I'm gonna get the ribs for two yards start grilling [Music] [Music] Oh Katie are you ready for some barbecue ribs I think the grills are perfect so the coals have the coals are perfect just put them on yeah you're in charge so any side first right the way they are right the way they are it's gonna be so great these are fantastic just the way you remember them I'm gonna do the table you're in charge okay great should I put the lid on this I would say with a flame like that put the lid on it the old African Tessa colors are red and white so I thought so appropriate to have a red in like cloth white plates hey Pierre I'm getting smoke in my face it's not it's not a barbecue until it catches on fire I think these still need a little bit more time before over we just have bags of candy with barefoot ribbons I thought it'd be really fun to put them right down the middle of the table [Music] all right er how the roots doing they're looking pretty good I think a little bit longer I'm impressed big napkins for ribs [Music] tear these look amazing you know one thing that's really important is that the coals are even and they're not too thick and you know how to do that they look pretty good but not too hot I'm so excited to see can't wait to see everybody we haven't seen some of them 20 years 20 years I mean it just it blows my mind I think yeah that's Susan Julie they they each have three kids oh is it time to turn these cars I think it's time to turn them we're gonna have a really good dinner licious perfect [Music] so the ganache is still a little bit warm so it's easy to pour it's amazing how shiny it is just gorgeous you can really taste that little bit of coffee and it really brings out the chocolate flavor can't imagine the think of baths of ganache we used to make for chocolate wedding cakes it was such an unusual wedding cake and I covered in fresh violets and white roses so beautiful big shiny chocolate wedding cake I have wonderful candied violets that we used to use that put on each one edible violets these are sometimes a little hard to find but if you find a bakery supply store or a specialty food store or cake decorating store something like that [Music] that doesn't look so bad doesn't okay I'm gonna put them on cake stands and they'll be ready to go out onto the table so the food's already tiers on the grill after 20 years I can't wait to see what everybody's doing much is local wine expert so we want everything she has I [Music] love the I think Martina and I worked on that it would be too was the combination of five marinades secret recipes old all combined together the secret ingredient is blue cheese surprise [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
[Music] I was playing bridge was my cardshark friends the other night we decided it's time to do something different why not dinner in a movie so I've gotten a fabulous French movie and I think I'll make a fabulous French dinner to go with it first my favorite chicken with 40 cloves of garlic the garlic has cooked for a long time and it gets so sweet a really quick couscous with toasted pine nuts and currants to soak up all those garlicky juices and for dessert an ice cream bomb with layers of mango sorbet raspberry sorbet and strawberry ice cream and for cocktails twist on an old favorite blood orange margaritas I've never had a bad night with these friends but I'd say this dinner in a movie will make a particularly funny [Music] when my friends come to dinner during the week I'm gonna make something looks impressive but you and I know it's gonna be really easy to make so I'm gonna make an ice cream bomb which is layers of ice cream and sorbet frozen together and it looks just gorgeous I need five cups of mango puree which is about five mangos so this is the last mango just cut the peel off and since I'm gonna puree just cube it really roughly um smells so good it smells very tropical so the ice cream bomb is gonna have mango sorbet on the outside raspberry sorbet next inside and in the very center of it is gonna destroy the ice cream okay so that's the mango and then report into the food processor and puree it mango can sometimes be a little stringy so you want to be sure you puree it well it's an amazing color isn't it it's gonna be gorgeous with the raspberry sorbet okay that looks good now I'm gonna add a little sugar syrup that I made so what this is is three-quarters of a cup of sugar and a half a cup of water and I just melted it so it's a syrup I'm gonna add that to the mango quarter of a cup of fresh orange juice orange juice really brings out the flavor in a mango and about a quarter teaspoon of salt I know salts an unusual thing to put in a sorbet but it really brings out the flavors and just be ready and that's pureed it's beautiful and I'm just going to refrigerate into gets really cold and then I'm gonna put in the ice cream maker [Music] so when my friends come to the bridge we always have cocktails tonight we're not playing bridge but we're definitely gonna have cocktails so I actually asked them what they wanted to drink and Jack Pearson suggests a blood orange margarita I thought that sounded really good so that's what I'm making can we start with half a cup of blood orange juice blood oranges originally came from Sicily and they're sweet but they also have a little bit of sort of tartness to it that I really like [Applause] and the color is amazing you can see why they call blood oranges so I need about a half a cup next thing I need is two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice [Music] it just makes it a little tartar and I need a cup of triple sec which is an orange liqueur [Music] blend it all together [Music] we love the color this needs to be delicious and report into picture [Music] cup of tequila that's gonna do it and I think because this is so beautiful know why it's serving highball glasses but I think I might have to serve with martini glasses into the fridge and blood orange margaritas are ready whenever we are which is always [Music] so the manga puree is chilled so I'm going to my ice cream maker it never gets really really hard to make the sorbet it'll finish freezing in the freezer that looks gorgeous so that's gonna take about 20 minutes and then I'm gonna freeze it into the ice cream bomb with the other layers of ice cream in the meanwhile start on the chicken before two cloves of garlic [Music] Wow so the first step in making the mango sorbet into an ice cream bomb I want to take a frozen bowl and put the mango sorbet right into the frozen bowl show you how this works so then what I'm going to do in order to have the next layer the same shape I'm gonna put this bowl inside that bowl so this is an 8 inch Bowl and I'm gonna put a six and a half inch bowl inside a little bit of plastic wrap will help me get the ball out inside and you see I'm gonna press it down and it's gonna make exactly the shape I want great I'm gonna put it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes until it gets frozen hard and the next thing I want to do is put the layer of raspberry sorbet in and since this is a movie party I put Jack in charge of buying popcorn [Music] there's the pop one microwave easy always good and now for the main course chicken with 42 garlic sounds like a lot of garlic doesn't it but it's really delicious the girl that gets really sort of brown and caramelized and sweet so instead of peeling every single one of these cloves of garlic it's so much easier if you just put them in hot water boiling hot water for about 60 seconds and then the peel just comes right off so what I did was I salt-and-pepper the chick and dry it off a little bit so it Browns nicely Brown it on both sides for about five minutes on each side and these guys look beautiful they're perfectly done just browned on the outside cuz I'm gonna cook it completely later a little bit of oil a little bit of butter so you get the flavor of the butter and the high burning temperature of the oil great so what I have left in the pan now is the oil and butter and all this gorgeous chicken flavoring I'm gonna take 40 cloves of garlic and put them right in I want them to confer back five maybe ten minutes until they're nice and browned on both sides I can already smell the garlic wonderful so there are two kinds of alcohol in this cognac and white wine they really have totally different flavors cutting acts a really full sort of strong flavor and the white wine has a mellow round flavor and I'm going to put in two tablespoons of Chania and what the cognac does is it scrapes up all the brown bits in the pan so it becomes part of the sauce so not only flavors it actually works for it it's wonderful huh I can smell the cognac and the garlic and the chicken this is gonna be really good chicken with 40 cloves of garlic it's a real guy dish and I have three of them coming for dinner tonight they're gonna be very happy and then I need one and a half cups of white wine pick a wine you want to drink I wouldn't put anything in the sauce that you wouldn't want to drink and then if there's leftover you can drink it got some white wine and then I'm gonna put the chicken right back into this and the white wine and the cognac and the chicken are all gonna cook together in about 30 minutes so I'm gonna bring this up to a boil put the chicken back in just pile it up in this pan this is a great Dutch oven and it's real I use it for everything from soups to stews but it's wonderful for chicken with 40 cloves of garlic tongs are actually great for this because then you don't pierce the skin and lose all the juices just pile them up in the pan okay and then there's some juices in the pan you want to just add them so they end up in the sauce okay now I'm just doing some fresh thyme so you just take doesn't have to be exact just take some time smells so good I can smell the garlic it's getting sweet chicken time just wonderful okay lid on it's gonna cook for about 30 minutes but its simmer and all the juices and the flavors are gonna get together it's gonna make chicken and a sauce [Music] now for the next layer of the ice cream bomb its community raspberry sorbet you take this little Bowl out and the plastic wrap really helps and now I've got softened raspberry sorbet just spoon this right into the mill colors are gorgeous the flavors are great that's a really summery combination just smooth it in a little bit of plastic wrap do a separate later right in the middle just smush it down into the freezer about 30 minutes and then later I'll put in strawberry ice cream and I'll have all three layers through the grate and that gives me just enough time to finish the chicken with garlic and make the couscous so to go with the chicken with 40 cloves of garlic I thought couscous would be perfect because it'll absorb all the wonderful flavor of the chicken and the garlic so I'm gonna start out by sautéing about 3/4 of a cup of shallots and some butter shallots are great because they have sort of button like a more delicate flavor than onions and they'll be really good with this and then I'm gonna add 3 cups of chicken stock 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper this may be the easiest dishes imaginable now you're gonna see the magic of couscous why don't have cups of couscous [Music] give it a stir turn off the heat put the lid on and the couscous is just gonna blow up all those wonderful flavors and in about ten minutes I'm going to fluff it with the fork add some toasted pignoli nuts and currants and it'll be done that's pretty easy and it's gonna be absolutely delicious chicken with 40 cloves of garlic and this looks like it's almost done I'm gonna do it take the chicken out a little bit so just put the chicken on the plate Oh smell the garlic it's really sweet it's amazing how it changes when it cooks for a long time I can smell the cognac and the wine I'm gonna have some very happy friends tonight I think I'm gonna put it down and I feel the good news is the whole dish can really be made a day or two in advance so it's great for entertaining okay now I'm gonna thicken the sauce a little bit so I'm gonna take about a half a cup of sauce doesn't matter if the girl that gets into it it's fine now I'm just gonna add two tablespoons of flour just thicken it up a little bit it's a good idea not to put the flour directly into the sauce because I don't like gravy it'll get lumpy so just whisk this together it doesn't matter if there's garlic in it'll just get mashed up with it even better just whisk this together until it's really smooth okay and then I'm just gonna pour this right back into the hot sauce slowly whisk it in yeah tablespoon of cognac actually adding this later in the sauce because then it'll have more of a bite the way cognac that hasn't been cooked so long has two tablespoons of heavy cream just to give it a little richness so just cook this for a minute so the flour doesn't have any uncooked flavor in it all the flavorings get together so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put the chicken right back in into the sauce now it's really thick and gorgeous and then I'll leave it in a 200 degree oven until we're ready to serve dinner all right let's do this the fast way slide it all in with all the juices on the plate lid on and into the open whoa that's a heavy pot and finally the last stage with the bomb we put strawberry ice cream right in the middle it actually looks like a lot of steps but they're really easy ones and so let's see how this comes out and I have softened strawberry ice cream but right in the middle you just fill it right up you know you can really do this with any kind of ice cream and then when it's turned out each slice is gonna have raspberry sorbet mango sorbet and strawberry ice cream it's just gorgeous perfect when put it in the freezer and let it freeze hard for about 30 minutes and now I'm just gonna finish the couscous and we're ready for dinner and a movie [Music] it so I'm gonna have two more flavors to the couscous the first ones toasted pignoli nuts they're pine nuts I think I've I've been you always is I think they really don't have any flavor until you toast them and then there are just nutty and delicious good right into the couscous quarter of a cup of dried currants that's what sort of like ways these but they're smaller a little tartar so the key to couscous is you don't want to stir it you want to fluff it with a fork and it gets all light and fluffy it's delicious just looks so good [Music] mark who's coming tonight called me and bet me five bucks that I'm is cooking with garlic I said of course she's cooking with garlic it's a French film but the good news is I brought my poker chips in case it's the boring French [Music] all right who wants a blood orange margarita this was Jack's idea so Jack gets the first one it's a very good idea margarita with blood orange juice instead of lime juice ready Noah Cheers chicken with 40 cloves of garlic [Laughter] so how about if I give everybody a plate don't help yourself jack because cuz with cannolis and currants [Laughter] [Music] Appetit fine how many cloves of garlic are actually actually for to close ago we counted every one 41 it's three hits of garlic no way comes you know mark bet me that you would be cooking the garlic tonight no I didn't take the back so I know you're gonna give us a hint about the movie no it's a surprise then so is dessert for dessert an ice cream bomb I just have to dip in in hot water now the key is to take it out in one piece hopefully without wearing it at the same time I think it's gonna come out and nobody will be more surprised than me turn it upside down unbelievable ice cream bomb and that's for you huh [Music] and you you're being good right you don't want me all right so we have a French movie but we can do what we usually do to play bridge well your poker chips oh my god do you have any cash I think we should play poker what do you think yeah okay French food is

[Music] my friend Frank has invited some friends to dinner tonight and I'm testing soup recipes all day so I said what are we join forces I'll bring soup to your house for dinner that way he doesn't have to cook and I can ro test my recipes the first tip is a really hearty lentil soup with spicy sausage and it's sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese the second recipe is a seafood stew that's full of shrimp and chunky fish just like the classic bluey bez but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] so for my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water intercept for my 15 minutes it just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make a big pot of soup and put them in and cook so I was with most soups I start with onions and this is a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions that's four cups of leeks there's a lot of soup I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because you can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months when tablespoon of chopped garlic there's been three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves who's gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good together lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just gonna cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's gonna be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is Karis keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually like it to look like it's homemade okay just big dice more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just gonna cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery it's gonna do it right down the middle I'm Barefoot Contessa we used to have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery you need to end up with like 200 quarts of soup it was really good okay so that's the carrots in the celery let me see if onions are ready no they're just simmering away here yeah perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender leaves okay now we're gonna add all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be really hard a soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s that was considered like hippie vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown have more flavor next a chicken stock how many chicken stock you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken stock and it's so easy to make so I have three quarts you'll go right in somehow I find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens in a pot with some carrots and celery thyme whole peppercorns it's so easy and I'm always in the kitchen for a couple of hours and it just boils away and then got a really good stock to make soups with I just keep it in the freezer and it's ready whenever I want to make soup okay so that's three quarts of chicken stock and then a quart of a cup of tomato paste gives it a lot of flavor it's surprising and last but not least lentils so this is a pound of lentils that I've soaked for about 15 minutes just pour them all in this is a big pot of soup so we're just gonna simmer this for about an hour all the flavors are gonna blend together and then it Franks has something to add spicy cabassa sausage and I'm gonna serve it with a drizzle of olive oil red wine and some Parmesan cheese delicious [Music] chive biscuits I thought they'd be wonderful with my soups making biscuits really is a lot like making scones the same sort of process so first I need two cups of flour and two my mixer [Music] the key to both of them is the butter you weren't really cold and you want it in big chunks so that they stay nice and light and fluffy one tablespoon of baking powder one teaspoon of salt [Music] put a sugar just a little bit of sweetness in them okay the next thing is butter so once take a very cold butter and we're going to dice it and then put it in the mixer and the mixers can do all the work [Music] okay I'm just gonna mix it until the butters about the size of peas okay in the meantime I need 3/4 of a cup of half-and-half who really make scones with any kind of savory herb like time would be wonderful or sage maybe for Thanksgiving make them let's say it's gonna be good with Turkey until that's ready only chop some chives line them up nice sharp knife who smells great it's a really delicate onion flavor it's gonna be good in the biscuits okay got a half a cup who's gonna put it in at the end so it doesn't get all smashed up have really fresh chive flavor okay that looks good I couldn't pour the cream in slowly with a mixer on it's a really wet dough but it's really delicious and the chives okay they're ready to roll out half a flower the board this is a really nice dough you really smell the chives too it's great good that's sticky this should make better eight biscuits just keep moving around on the board you know just want to make sure it doesn't stick and you can pat them out or you can roll the mat I was like you roll it up looks nice smooth even this I just think it's nice if you have something as simple as soup to have something a little special like homemade bread okay two and a half inch cutter just come out my pan these are great served on their own but they're also absolutely delicious sort of as a little sandwich like a forty or something I bet than that thing that's great exactly eight okay now I'm going to do a little egg wash make the tops nice and brown and a little bit of half-and-half just whisk it together that easy to do in a small bowl okay I'm just gonna brush the top slightly well these are gonna be just delicious with soups okay nothing like the smell of biscuits it's a 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're delicious chive biscuits with our soup I love a classic French boy abyss but it takes forever to make so instead I'm gonna make a sequence do with all the same flavors shellfish shrimp fish and it's gonna be so delicious I nail hi how are you I'm good Wow so I'm making a seafood stew can you get me a few things actually there are a lot of kinds of shrimp but why don't I take the clean ones all right so a pound of clean shrimp please then I could always peel them into vain them myself but why not get them already done there's a lot of work take some time exactly [Music] 24 muscles all right it's a great you're wonderful and I need a pound of halibut delay I need a pound of sea bass please all right you know there are a few things to look for when you're looking for fish and I think they're pretty standard one is that it doesn't smell very fishy and this I mean there's no fish smell here it's amazing and the other is that the eye of the fish is really bright that was really fast thanks so much Neil well it's gonna be great they do thank you oh joy bye-bye [Music] the second soup I want to test is a seafood stew so the first thing I'm gonna heat some oil and then cut up some onions two yellow onions oil is hot it's going to put the onions right in next I'm gonna do potatoes I need two cups of potatoes and these are you can go they have lots of flavor next the fennel I love bell it's got that wonderful anise flavor and when it's cooked not that crazy better it raw but when it's cooked and just there's a really delicate flavor so I'm just gonna chop this up this is a very provençal flavor and into the soup okay that's it for the panel two teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of pepper stir it all together let's gonna cook about 15 minutes so the vegetables and the potatoes are all tender in the meantime I need some seafood for the seafood stew [Music] lots of great seafood seafood stock so first thing I want to do is soak the mussels a little sand in the mussels and nobody needs stand in their seafood stew so fill it with water and then a handful of flour in the water just mix it around and what happens is the mussels break the water with the flour and they discourage any sand that they have inside so leave these to soak and I think seafood stood ready for a little wine two cups of a nice dry white wine you never cook with anything I wouldn't want to drink and seafood stock you can make it organ by it I need four cups which is a quart it smells good and one twenty ounce can of plum tomatoes pull them right in okay next I'm gonna add some garlic you got to have garlic and seafood stew sounds gonna chop it up three cloves 3 big cloves of garlic actually add this later in the stew so it doesn't burn okay three cloves of garlic right into the stew and then the truly Provencal ingredient is saffron it's the stamens of crocuses anyone she was really good whole saffron not the powdered kind and I'm gonna add one teaspoon which is all of this hill of saffron it really gives a full flavor and a little bit of spice to this do so this kind of just simmer for about 15 minutes while I get the seafood ready so I owe this great fish first I'm gonna start with the halibut just slice it in big chunks [Music] you always want to choose sort of firm flesh fish it's not gonna just disintegrate let's do the second one is the sea bass I'm just going to slice this across - so you want big enough chunks so they don't disintegrate but small enough ones I still actually cooking this doing pretty quickly okay next I'm gonna rinse the mussels first I'm just gonna check and see if any of them are open permanently since they're not alive and they all look gorgeous so they're fine a few times to make sure there's no flour perfect okay the last things the shrimp what am I glad I got this peeled and deveined so much work okay I think the students just about ready for the seafood this looks pretty good okay lots of fish [Music] dirt and it's gonna cook really fast now thanks to the shrimp this time so chunky and delicious full of flavors okay and last the mussels I love the color and the texture this makes but along the flavor it's gonna cook in about five minutes all the fish and the shrimp and mussels are gonna be done and then when I go to Frank's house I'm gonna add the two essential for your best ingredients there know and are obsessed so [Music] Frank's guests are arriving he's giving you the nice glass of white wine and I'm gonna just finish the soups love cooking in this kitchen so the seafood student he's a little bit of orange zest and some pear know I love those two flavors in the [Music] okay that should be about a tablespoon with the orange zest it's the soup this clash of Prayer no liquors flavor that really brings out the flavor of this film just mix it together this looks so gorgeous [Music] well that's ready they better be hungry they better not be having too much fun without me I'm gonna feel like Cinderella in the kitchen now okay one soup down one to go so I made lentil soup often but I just thought I'd experiment by putting sausage in it so I'm putting in kielbasa which is a cooked Polish sausage it's really good it's got some nice spice to it but this is really easy because you don't even have to cook it it's already smoked and cups and okay let's see how this lentil soup is doing Oh looks pretty good still this guy out [Music] wonderful so it's good but the sausage and all I have to do is just heat it through which will happen pretty fast it's a really hearty soup and I think adding the Cabasa really makes it like a meal both of these soups can meal themselves curious which one people are gonna like more a little splash of red wine or red wine vinegar and then I'm gonna serve it with a drizzle of olive oil cheese good and this is the stove could you kind of do this every night [Music] sausage sausage expand it's really good anything you said anything what would

I love to see what kind of breakfast offerings people come up with during the holidays when our holiday baking championship Baker's served up their breakfast extravaganzas the one thing missing for me it was a really flaky Danish and when it comes to flaky Danish my mind starts racing when I think about the possibilities so I love really flaky Danish pastry the one thing that intimidates most people is how to create the flake let me take you through how to make a laminated pastry down that's when you rapped owe a round butter fold it and turn it over and over and so you have the right amount of layers so for me the ultimate breakfast Danish has a goat cheese of pear filling this is crazy good for breakfast it's salty and sweet for this recipe i hit the kitchen with my favorite baker sara gonzalez so it starts by making a basic pastry dough which really starts by making a cold-pressed butter the trick here is to put the butter in between wax paper make sure you have cold workable butter and make sure you know exactly how big it is so you know how big to make your actual dill so when you start folding you're not gonna have any pieces that are overlapping you want a rectangle to cut into even size Danish at the end so measure it this one here is a six inch by 12 inch rectangular so once this is done put it in the freezer to chill thoroughly now you're ready to make the dough and this is cool because you get to activate yeast which means the dough is a lot usually when you wake up you want breakfast when the yeast wakes up it also wants breakfast so you don't want to just bloom yeast and water you want to make sure it's a milk and especially flour okay so you want to pay attention here really makes it well scrape the size and you may want to change from the paddle to the dough hook as the dough gets more supple now what it's done mixing it's time to need it every good Baker needs a rolling pin now you want to measure this remember that butter that we measured into a rectangle this is why you measured it this is a 14 inch square remember when you taste this how flaky it'll be this is definitely worth the effort so this is step one and laminated dough you have dough you have butter you're folding it together you're rolling it out you're gonna fold it again you're gonna roll it again you're gonna fold it one more time and then you're gonna roll that out too you can do this at home I know it's intimidating I know it's scary as long as you stay mindful you will be able to laminate down your own house promise if Sarah can do it so once you have the layers cut the dough into pieces these are gonna be the tops and the bottoms to your Danish alright it's time to start on the filling take your goat cheese your cream cheese and your sugar add your salt and your egg yolk and cream until it's really smooth remember don't forget to scrape the sides as this mix so put that aside in the refrigerator and let's move to the pears you want to slice him up real thin then add the spices and the brandy saute those for about five minutes so we got pears we got laminated dough got goat cheese let's make some Danish all right now you want to coat this with a quick egg wash an egg wash makes a dose shiny makes until crispy it gives it flavor and texture and color one same that delicious are you that on Christmas morning now that's a breakfast if you can't get enough baking during the holidays go to foodnetwork.com celess holiday Baker is gonna watch my video series and check out all my tips and tricks to make your holidays the sweetest ever

the holiday baking championship the Baker's had to take a typical holiday activity and turn it into a dessert okay so what do you like to do during the holidays me I like to ice skate so we're gonna make a cake that looks like an ice skate that's dancing on its toe so you're doing a cake like this it's really kind of like balanced on one edge you really have to build a structure to hold it all together so as you can see the skate is bolted through the base so this isn't gonna go anywhere it's not what I got to do is fill up this part with cake this part with cake we're gonna decorate the whole thing and it's gonna look seamless you know there's so much cool symbolism around the holidays there's so many things that you can make a cake up go for it don't be afraid of it okay so what I have is a vanilla sponge and American buttercream first I'm gonna start stacking up the cakes and filling up all this negative space when you're making a cake sculpture we use cake and buttercream don't use anything else like you've used some kind of mousse use some other kind of filling you just don't really know how it's gonna react buttercream is more stable thing out there so you're looking at a 3d shape like this you really just have to guess on how much cake you have I got a lot of experience and we've made a lot of cakes so I can usually look at something and know okay this is how much cake I'm gonna need it's always good to over make not over bake the cakes over bake the number of cakes that's important make sure you have enough cake if you go over you're gonna have plenty of cake to make some friends well show me some kids running around the neighborhood like all right who wants cake I know that this is way off the mark but you just start with a piece like that and so you just slowly and gently pair it away until it looks like what you want it to look like you just look for the natural contours of whatever shape you're carving and off you go so we cake didn't quite reach the edge here and take something cake that I carved off the top and use it on a bomb gonna recycle this we're ready to face now this is the magic this is when you take something that's made out of ten different materials and make it into one seamless shape you make it 3d cakes you're gonna do a lot of icing a lot of your icing is actually structural to really keeping the shape of your cake cake carving is an inexact science so whenever you have any sort of like divots or things like that let's fill it up a buttercream okay so it's looking pretty good it's a little heavier than it used to be sometimes it's really nice to get a 360-degree view of whatever it is that you're doing just to make sure there's nothing really glaring that sticks out sorry to let this buttercream set up in the fridge and then I'll decorate first thing we're gonna do I'm gonna put some black on the top so I made some black tinted rolled fondant I'm gonna roll out a small piece and just stick it on top of the skate just wanna take a little bit of water and just wet the top okay with an exacto knife she's going to trim off the excess you know using your thumb to smooth it down anything you can imagine I can turn it into a cake and you can - you gotta look at the way that this cake is built think about the physics of it it's really not that complicated so the weights going down into three pieces to be the tongue the left side and the right side these white fondant for that take a little water and just wet the front if anything ever gets sticking just a little bit of cornstarch take out some of the extra would be easier to work with you can get a little more detailed as you get closer to its final shape and just smooth this down to the contours of the skate they want to find the line of the tongue right here okay one side now let's do the right side it's now ready to do some detail on this cake we need some really simple items get a bamboo skewer and the back of a paintbrush with the paintbrush we're gonna make the holes that the laces go through okay now we're gonna make some laces because if the laces I'm going to use some light blue fondant okay now I get the laces done got do the tie so I got the laces done now I'm gonna paint on the wooden sole okay so now I'm gonna paint on the wood I'm using brown food coloring and they thinned it out a little white alcohol can use vodka rum anything like that don't worry if you're serving this to kids the alcohol of that word keep paying until the fondant gets really sticky and then because it's really sticky it'll kind of grab the brush the brush will drag the sugar and start getting this texture it looks like we're doing all right so there's my escape cake for this ice skate cake recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com so I stood up sweet spot

okay so baking cakes for the holidays is awesome baking pies for the holiday is really awesome too for the holiday baking championship we asked the Baker's to stuff the cake you stuff a turkey right so why not a cake what if you could do something really cool what if you could bake a pie inside of a cake now you can make all this stuff from scratch you can also buy all this stuff at the store it's totally cool the whole point of this thing is really have fun and stick a pie inside of a cake so if you know make it from scratch don't worry about it you need four cakes cherry pie filling some pie dough and some chocolate frosting you'll also need a couple of tools you have pizza cutter a big round cookie cutter and a ruler okay so the first thing you want to do is cut some holes in your already baked cakes leave the ruler out so you can see half the cake take the ruler go 90 degrees make another mark that's the middle of your cake when I get right on top here you're gonna have four cakes total you're going to only cut holes out of three cakes you're gonna ice the inside you're gonna build the barrel of pie right in here bottom cake is gonna be a whole cake something has to hold up your barrel of pie now it's time to ice the case what I've done here it's taking some store-bought frosting and I put it in a mixer even though it's store-bought you still want to whip it up a lot of times when people icing your cakes and having problems with it it's just because the icing is too thick okay first you can ice the bottom layer you can ice the whole cake okay so what I'm using here is a cake wheel and what this does it spins the cake so I can keep making the same motion and that'll ice the cake really smoothly instead of moving my arm all the way around just moving my hand straight up and back here comes the next one once this cake touches the frosting that's on the bottom layer it's not moving its cake will break in half really really quickly so you want to make sure you get your hands all the way underneath and then very quickly line up the edge and lay it down all right so get your frosting on here then you just want to run your knife all the way around do like two times three times maybe four times okay so now we're gonna put on the next layer take the clean side of the cardboard stick it on here move the cake towards the edge and then line up the edge and just gently pull it out try not to scrape up the chocolate frosting and there you go and the top way you want to get a lot more frosting on there because you have to do the sides as well you don't want to leave the cake on iced cause then it'll dry out really quick it doesn't have to be pretty just get it on there so you can take a nice bench scraper just sticking on the sides you don't have a bench scraper can always use one of these you'll get the same effect this is just a lot easier scrape scrape scrape scrape scrape scrape you can go nice and fast and once you get good at this this is gonna be second nature now here's a tricky part icing the top of a cake you only go in never go out you go scrape and we'll wipe scrape and white now that you have the whole ice you want to measure it you're gonna cut out pie dough's slats it's actually gonna build the walls of the barrel so you take the ruler stick it in here and it looks like we are exactly two and a half inches perfect all right so let's talk pie dough the pie dough is really easy to make just butter flour water and salt so this pie dough doesn't have big chunks of butter in here I don't want it real flaky this pie dough is actually gonna have a structural purpose we're gonna cut out the slats of the barrel this is gonna hold all the pie filling inside the cake I'm gonna take a little flour I'm gonna put it down on my board just a bit you don't need a whole lot now before you roll it out just push it down with their hands it's a lot easier to get it from here to here with your hands and it is with a rolling now you can roll looking good the first thing we're gonna cut out is the bottom of the berry this is same cutter you used for the cake I'm gonna cut out a circle of pie you're gonna cut a straight edge you're gonna measure two and a half inches which is how deep the cake is we cut about 3/4 inch thick slats now you gonna bake this off at 375 for 10 to 12 minutes check it at 8:00 it's firstly gonna take your big round cookie you need to drop that guy right in the middle then you're gonna take your slats okay so I wanna make sure that you're really getting pretty tight seal you want to make sure they're nice and snug because the whole reveal of this is when you cut it open this is exactly one can of cherry pie filling from the grocery store see if it fits and what you want to do here is you want to go just below the crust that way your icing will have something to grab this is gonna be very difficult to ice Oh we'll figure you've got it all piled up and you gotta smooth it out very very carefully they used a lot of frosting layer it on there and then gently smooth it out you don't wanna be mess around that too much if I gave this one more pass it's gonna curl up I'm gonna get all this cherry pie filling through the top of the frosting then you got to start all over nobody wants to start over now we just got to decorate this thing make a look real cake like okay so now I'm gonna pipe a border on here no bigger offense than seeing the cardboard underneath the cake let's add some snow a lot of times when people are trying to sprinkle powdered sugar they'll take their hand and they'll actually hit the strainer it's not how you want to do it gonna take the strainer and hit your hand you have much more control perfect okay now I'm gonna ask Sarah is my favorite Baker to come in and cut this cake and let's see if I can fool her hey Sarah hi dad I made you a chocolate cake yeah beautiful thank you very much oh my gosh can I get it now yeah cut a nice big slice like I'm

the holiday is that pie right the holiday baking championship Baker's made some awesome pies but I never stopped thinking about what I would do for the perfect holiday pie my mind goes immediately to a pumpkin pie that's actually two desserts in one a good pumpkin cream pie is pretty easy to find and that's great but I like to up the game by adding a whole nother dessert I taught my pumpkin pie with a cheesecake topping this is a balanced beautiful pie that will definitely win awards this recipe i hit the kitchen with my favorite Baker sara gonzalez so start off by making the basic pumpkin cream pudding for the film basically it's milk brown sugar cornstarch and eggs what you're doing if you really think about it is making a pumpkin pastry cream when you're making this just like in a pastry cream slowly add your hot milk you don't want to scramble the eggs that's for breakfast next add the konkan feeling you want a thick almost pudding like consistency that'll help that pie set up a lot better but then just pour it into a prepared gingersnap pie crust
every year is a holiday I like to think about tradition and then think about ways to make it new so I thought I'd take a traditional Mexican eggnog drink called a romp opaque and turn it into a pastry cream and then pipe it into a crispy churro rabota is just fun to say right would you rather say Ron Pope is an eggnog egg mag go Boop it gonna poop it roll pulpit strong word all right first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take some milk some sugar smallman I'm gonna buzz min this blender give it all she's got captain ya got the load I'm going to take this over and put it on the heat then to this mixture i'm gonna add one big fat cinnamon stick cinnamon into the milk now so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make a slurry the slurry is basically any mixture that contains cornstarch or flour that you're going to use to thicken up a liquid you got to make sure to whisk all the corn starts really evenly into the egg yolks you got to get it all you don't want to see any of that white powder now you see how the milk is just starting to boil you want to get it just to the point where it boils and then take it off the stove real fast glad you go you ready ready ready ready ready ready boom okay so now this is tempering so what you want to do is just put a little bit just like that and then stir it up and then what you're doing here is you're getting the eggs used to the idea that they're gonna be warm they're like oh okay it's a little warmer in here and then once you get some in there and you kind of go slow so just sort of poor all this good stuff in here then you want to put all these yolks this whole mixture back into here okay now this is gonna happen real fast can already feel it's starting to thicken up so I'm going to turn the heat down see the tracks from the whisk and then into the bowl okay now while this is hot we're gonna go pinch of salt butter in the rump now some of this alcohol is gonna steam off but you want to keep some of it because you do want to taste this stuff and use a dark rum so right now it looks sort of gross you can fix that so you got all this liquid you just add it to it and your added a bunch of fat just mix it in and emulsified all these different things together it's going to give this pastry cream a really nice latin feel after you make your pastry cream get your plastic wrap out then you're going to push it down onto the surface of the pastry cream okay so let's get this in the fridge and let's get it out of my hand because it's burning my fingerprints off these are my churros want to serve these when they're nice and hot so the day before your party make your rum both a face your cream make your churro batter put everything in piping bags and then you're ready to go and all you got to do pipe out churros fill them with the Rome Pope a and they're nice and a hot and crispy and everybody's going to think you're an awesome Baker okay let's fill these guys grab a churro you want to poke a hole in just one end okay here's a churro find a little hole squeeze it there go nuts how you fill a churro I mean seriously Ron Pope a filled churros hope we're done are we done filming over time filming John Romero mouth no longer are so good this is a great little dessert we took a lot of things that are really traditional made something new with for this recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com
I think of holiday wreaths I think of how they read you can eat because I'm always thinking about things to put my mouth for the holiday baking championship the Baker's were asked to tap into a seasonal trend create edible holiday wreaths cool right so here's when you can try at home my Madeline wreath was sour cherry mousse it looks like a holiday wreath but instead of weaves we're using green-tinted Madeline's here's how you make up so Madeline batter is typically as jinhua or French butter cake you start out by whipping some medals whatever your whipping age you're usually whipping egg whites here you're whipping the whole egg it's gonna whip up it's gonna get really frothy and really really like a light buttery color once you start getting some foam on top that's gonna start adding the sugar okay see Jose is getting really nice and fluffy in there just added really really slowly and you basically tempering the eggs and letting them know that they're about to get sweet God pinch of salt now we're really nice and fluffy here turn it down a little bit and just two teaspoons of vanilla there's a teaspoon of lemon zest now we're gonna bake Madeleine's for breakfast leave them as they are since we're making a wreath we got to make them green listen man food coloring is fun you can put food coloring in something like a Madeleine and make something really cool people like eating food that's a beard color if it makes sense like you don't want to eat a green steak but green Madeleine's think that's okay okay now we got nice fluffy whipped eggs let's make a Xinhua so you have to do is a lot of very very gentle folding 20 of these eggs we're gonna fold two cups of all-purpose flour here I have a cup of melted butter I'm gonna slowly and gently fold from the top because you're taking your time with this cake this is what's gonna give you that beautiful texture of a Madeleine Madeline's are really special cooking if you read proofs to know I'm talking and you really take your time with Madeline's and you're gonna get a delicious texture tell you many things are pre to make the pre to look at in the preview that is a good-looking batter now think about Madeline's you got a pipe into the molds and get them in the oven right away okay and then gently without a lot of force you don't need a lot of Madeleine's to make this reef you're also gonna need a lot about on two feet everybody these things go fast 375 for about 15 minutes okay so let's talk about cream cheese mousse now the cream cheese is room temperature really really important if it's cold this will take forever and you'll get big old chunks cream cheese is a great base for a mousse because it's super super stable you start adding some sugar now you can use a stand mixer for this the thing is it's always gonna be a kid around the kids always gonna want to lick the beaters I like the beaters you slipped up here we'll turn this up a little bit now you're cooking with gas teaspoon of vanilla and there you put us all now we're all incorporated let's deal with our chairs these are sour cherries sour cherries are an awesome holiday flavors pull out a bunch of cherries but I'm also gonna use about two tablespoons of the cherry juice the syrup itself is really sour so what I'm gonna do is taste as I go so these cherries are doing triple duty here they are color their texture and the flavor it's no it's good some nice chunks of cherry okay let's give it a whirl get it give it a whirl they're gonna add some quiche it's really gonna make the flavor League deep that's gonna be delicious to make this into a moose gonna fold in whipped cream again with the folding you're using this is a very delicate dessert all these things take a really light touch this is a really fun recipe to do when you're really trying to practice your baking skills that's like a really nice let's give this a little what fer okay so we're all set moose is nice and cold all my cookies have cooled and they're nice and bright green now we're ready to build a wreath the Moose is a glue that's gonna hold the whole wreath together my wreath is about this wide cool and now I can start placing cookies now all that's left is decorating and put a nice big bow on here I'm gonna put a couple of maraschino berries and we're gonna make it snow okay so the first decoration we're gonna make for the wreath is going to be a modeling-chocolate bow so here I made big block of modeling chocolate and then I dyed it red working with modeling chocolate you want to make sure it's warm enough that you can use it but it's not so one that's gonna melt there's a sweet spot you got to find it when you're rolling out modeling chocolate with the rolling pin which one to do is start out with no parchment paper on top just to get it nice and fine cut it into strips and wrap it around this paper towel tube and that's gonna be our boat you can make the boat stick together just use a tiny tiny bit of water you guys you can totally do this at home I need his household items and modeling Chuck super easy that's ready for the fridge these are maraschino cherries I got a whole bowl here that I've drained out all the liquid is gone I'm gonna use the cherries as the little berries inside the wreath cool thing is you got Madeline's with a sour cherry moose adults are gonna love that then you'd out these little maraschino is all over there and all the kids are gonna eat the maraschino cherries there's something for everybody you know the color of these cherries really pops you don't want to

okay let's say you get a gift basket for the holidays it's got some stuff in there and you just don't know what to do with it can take that stuff and repurpose it and make other things with for the holiday baking championship the Baker's receive holiday food baskets and had to create an amazing dessert made from their gift items so I just got a gift basket had some brandy in it and had some candied pecans I was like okay what can I do with these things what I can do I can make some candies I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make Brandi and maple cream jelly I'm gonna dip it in chocolate and I'm gonna roll it around and smash candied pecans it's gonna be delicious all right so to make these jellies first thing I have to do is prep your pan take a regular cake pan just like this wrap it in plastic wrap make sure you get the plastic all the way down into the corners here then take some parchment paper cut it to size and stick that in your pan also when you're prepping your pan you want to make sure that the plastic wrap goes up the side and out this way once your jellies are done you can grab the plastic wrap and pull the whole thing out makes it really easy so you're not digging around in here and messing up the edges okay so first let's make the maple cream you're gonna bloom some gelatin okay so i have here for envelopes of gelatin and a poor in just enough water kind of get it going Shelton's really fun stuff pour the water in there make sure all the gelatin gets nice and wet and it just kind of turns into this stuff okay so while the gelatin is blooming we're gonna heat up the cream one make sure they happen half is nice and warm is that's gonna melt the gelatin it's just about to boil so let's turn the heat down gonna add this gelatin and you go the hot cream will start to melt it like we're almost all the way melted going to add the sugar we get add the maple syrup real maple syrup come with a like a tin can with a rust on it has a picture of a tree and a snowy landscape a little tap sticking out of it mm-hmm okay so just give this a stir make sure all that sugars melted all that gelatin is infused I think we're good to go so now I'm gonna do is pour this into my prepared cake pan put it in the fridge to set up should take about 40 minutes okay let's let this set up okay so 40 minutes have passed it looks like our jellies are looking good that's our maple cream now let's make the brandy jelly what I have is one cup of simple syrup let's bloom this gelatin just about there the trick here is you want to keep the alcohol in the brandy so I'm gonna make sure that the gelatin is all the way melted you know poor the brandy in and take it off the heat right away if you don't all the alcohol will evaporate these are like gummies for grown-ups I love gummies okay I think we're in good shape add the brandy now for this on top of the cold maple cream as you do that just make sure that you're moving the stream around so you're not pouring in the same exact spot you do you'll melt a hole in your other guns there you go all right go back in the fridge for another 40 minutes ok so my gelatin is all set up my jellies look really nice now I'm ready to make these candies gonna unmold the jellies and cut them so they came out really nice you can see bottom layer is a maple cream the top layer is the brand new this looks so cool alright I'm going to take a really sharp knife let's give me alicious so I do is I chopped up about three pounds of chocolate put it over a double boiler I never turned into this beautiful stuff now we're gonna temper it so to temper the chocolate poured out onto the table tell me that doesn't look cool so what you do is you just start spreading out the chocolate this is agitated as a chocolate schooling it's crystallizing and you want to make sure that those crystals are really small when you get really small crystals you get really smooth tempered chocolate that snaps when you bite into it you need to feel the chalk is starting to thicken up a little bit so the way that you know that you're done is really it's just by feel you could take a little bit of the chocolate just like this take a little bit of this stick it over here and just watch what it does does it solidify you get shiny does it solidify and get dusty if it's dusty it's not tempered if it's shiny it is temporary this is starting to feel really nice okay I'm gonna go back in the bowl all right tempered chocolate okay so now you have a huge mess in your kitchen the way you want to do just want to scrape all this chocolate up put it back in the bowl and then anything else that's left soap and water that's it totally take care of the chocolate or you can just this is a very sophisticated piece of equipment it's the chocolate dipper 6001 I made it myself out of a fork take the jelly drop it in the chocolate getting a little chocolate on top and pick it up with the fork we want to do is touch the bottom of the jelly to the top of the chocolate the surface tension will grab all the extra chocolate and pull it off there we go looks good lips to fold you're looking at like a box of chocolates you're under like oh how do they get that little design on top that's how they do it and some pecans kind of have a feeling these are gonna be delicious okay so I'm gonna finish the rest of these and get them in the fridge to cool okay so these guys have been chilling in the fridge cannot wait to taste these things it's a nice temper on there that was delicious here's the thing you get a gift box it's got a bunch of weird stuff in there take that stuff mix it up cook it do some fun things to it and you can make it amazing so to get my recipe for chocolate covered maple brandy jellies with nuts go to

for the holiday baking championship we asked the Baker's to celebrate the season and bake a dessert with a fall harvest ingredient so here's what I would do for a fall harvest dessert using wait for it wait for it butternut squash I'm gonna take this squash I'm gonna turn it into a diplomat cream and I'm gonna make little meringue gift boxes fill the boxes with the cream and it's gonna be awesome now if the meringue takes a long time so let's start with that I'll start out whipping this on relatively slow speed just until I start getting some bubbles in every meringue you want to do a tiny pinch of salt next your cream of tartar and I you see the eggs are starting to get nice and fluffy so start adding this sugar a little bit at a time it's going to get really frothy and then you're gonna stop when you have stiff peaks and it's really shiny you know my rings are awesome they're super light in your mouth and a new not super rich but then when you dry them out you can build stuff with them that's pretty stiff it's not even a sparrow it's like a Finch so this meringue is ready to go so I cut out a stencil just a piece of cardboard just like that put a little handle on there so it's easy to use have a silicone mat I'm gonna spread the meringue on too it's a meringue on there and just gently spread just to the edges there you go do that a few more times five more times to be exact I have six sides we ever do a whole box okay so there's my 6 i'm gonna make a few extra okay i think that should be enough so now i'm going to put it back onto the sheet tray and put it into the oven three hours at 150 degrees let's make some diplomat cream diplomat cream so pastry cream with whipped cream fold it into it it's kind of like a moose so I took a butternut squash I peeled it then I roasted it and put in a food processor and now I have cooked butternut squash puree you could totally buy this stuff if you don't want to deal with a butternut squash but they're really fun and they're cute okay so taking the butternut squash puree egg and add this to the eggs I'm gonna whisk all this good stuff together I want to make sure you have any lumps of cornstarch oh that smells like fall okay just about to boil okay hot milk cold eggs gotta go slow don't want to scramble those eggs just get them used to the idea that they're about to get one go back on the heat I just want to make sure nothing's sticking to the bottom we get burnt just starting to get real thick it's gonna happen real quick cause the cornstarch and the flour thick hang up okay back into this bowl nothing's burnt okay you take the butter and vanilla stir that around till it melts the butters gonna make that page cream nice and smooth you add the vanilla at the end of the Patrian process you don't wanna cook it the more you cook vanilla it loses its flavor you can smell it now while the page cream is still hot take some plastic wrap lay it down you're going to go all the way to the surface of the pastry cream to make sure that you don't get any skin okay so now let's put the pastry cream in the fridge ok so my diplomat cream is chilling in the fridge it's been about three hours so let's check on this meringue looks pretty good first things first gotta get them rings off the sheet pan when you're getting the Rings off of the sheep in make sure you have a nice small offset spatula so you can very gently just get underneath these are very fragile it way absolutely nothing when you pick them up like this and with the edge of your offset just knock loose any little piece that you don't want on there because this has to form a really nice box all these little guys here all gone and say this is probably the ugliest one so there's gonna be the bottom gonna make little piping bag fold flip took me about a month to learn how to do that just practice practice practice you'll get it now here I got some royal icing and put just a skosh here's a plate cut just a little tiny hole just like that move the royal icing down it's what you can do now is do a fun little design on the side of the box you anyway make a snowman make an igloo reindeer ending 1 i'm gonna do a snowflake when you're piping something that's really really small you want to use a really small piping bag because you have so much more control so this is the third side of the box i'm gonna do the four side and the top now we got to build the box lay down a little bit of royal icing right here just took our first side down cock it in case when i saw the signs and get all these corners so the box doesn't fall apart take a little extra time and just pipe some beads along the border it's gonna look really really really nice so the box is looking really good now it's time to fold the diplomat cream so what I'm gonna do is take a little bit of this whipped cream and fold it into the pastry cream that's kind of lighten up the texture they're gonna take that and fold it back into the rest of the whipped cream and that's gonna give me a nice light airy diplomat cream I really getting under there so you gonna take a nice big spoon you need to fill up your box very careful you don't want to mess up all that nice work you just do okay it's looking pretty good you take a little tiny bit of cinnamon put that on top just to give it some color now I need to get a lid on this box and prop it

pi is like the holidays con job classic memories for me for the holiday baking championship we asked the Baker's to create a decorated pie based on a personal holiday memory so I wanted to make a cool decorative portrait on top of a traditional custard pie my cinnamon chess pie is a classic custard pie that face almost all the way in the other then I stopped the baking then top the pie with a color cookie dough put it all back in the oven and everything finishes together all right so let's start with the crust what I have here is one recipe of my pie dough that's been blind baked baked it for about eight minutes at 400 degrees okay so next we're gonna put an egg wash on this pie crust got a little bit of sugar go for it it's tears really good a pot I'm sorry you're in charge all right see all this okay now let's make the custard the cornmeal and of chess pie cut down the sweetness so you know custard pies are really cool and they're always delicious but chess pies are just a little bit earthier and just have a lot more dimension so we have eggs coin meal flour cinnamon butter milk sugar and cooled brown butter you want to make the brown butter but then you want to cool it cuz you don't want to cook the eggs go for it all right we're gonna start adding wet dry wet dry hora meal flour cinnamon sigh man look let's all just saw always when you're making a chest x don't just get regular corn meal you have to get finely ground corn yo your regular corn meal its way to course you don't want that alright that looks nice move slowly add that butter for my job but uh I do this is the brown butter i'm going to add it slow so it doesn't solidify constantly whisking when you're pouring brown butter out you want to stop with about a teaspoon left in there is when you make brown butter all the milk solids get really really dark and a little bit too bitter that very last teaspoon that's where all the burnt stuff is just leave that in the pot so it doesn't end up in your pie okay you're probably looking at this feeling of being like wow that is really really liquidy don't worry about it there's a lot of eggs in there and there's also some flour to help find it up this thing bakes can be really really soft really really delicious so we're gonna bake this by 350 degrees for 35 minutes after 10 minutes though we're gonna cover the edge of the foil to make sure they don't burn okay so while that's baking let's make some cookies okay so what I have here is a sugar cookie dough and I've made a bunch of different colors so this cookie dough is actually a saw blade oh it's a lot more like a shortbread than it is like a traditional sugar cookie can find the recipe of food network com so now what I have I made some stencils I got a little tree with a little trunk I have some presents too it's gonna be really cute first you want to do roll out sheets of the cookie dough and then put it in the freezer so it gets really hard Sarah's gonna roll out this dough in between two pieces of parchment that way she doesn't have to use flour and it's gonna keep the colors really bright want to make sure these cookies are nice and thin because these are gonna bake on top of the pie with the pie if they're too thick they're not gonna bake all the way you want to make sure they get nice and crispy oh look at that is so clever ok let's get this in the freezer yes okay so it's been a few minutes and I think the dough is ready awesome cone okay first what you do is you take your stencil just lay it down on the cookie stencils are great in the kitchen they really hope you be creative and they really save you a lot of time looks like a Christmas tree all right so now let's cut out the rest of these no I think our pie is ready we still gotta bake it for another 10 minutes after we put these cookies on the pies looking really good it's nice and dark colors flavor it's a lot of sentiment in here it's a lot of brown butter in here and that's what's giving it that really nice dark golden brown now let's add our cookies that's ready to go back in the oven for about 10 more minutes ok so this by has been cooling for a couple hours now I'm ready to decorate before I do anything on the pie I'm gonna create a couple little bows for my presence so I made some white royal icing just egg whites and powdered sugar I'm doing is I'm just piping a couple little loops on the lip of this pole and then when they dry I'm gonna pull them off and use them as a little 3d bow on top of the presents and we're just gonna let those air dry okay mr. pie let's see what you got this is a bag of black royal icing I'm just cut a little hole here this was gonna outline all the presents and you'll see how the 3d when you're piping something that's really really small you want to use a really small piping bag because you have so much more control so what I'm using for ornaments are little tiny pearl Dragic basically just a fancy sprinkle how about that for a decorator pie tomy but it's still impressive everyone is gonna see this is gonna freak out it is delicious for my cinnamon chess pie recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com / stuff sweet spot
for the holiday baking championship great was proved that it's not the holidays without cookies all right so for a really cool cookie looking at hamentashen even taught her to Jewish cookies now they're usually for porom but this cookie we're gonna jazz it up with some holiday flavors and we're gonna make this thing ready for Hanukkah so here's my friend sara gonzalez she's gonna show you how to make it and I'm gonna explain it so this cookie starts with the dough first we're gonna cream the butter and the sugar my great grandmother told me and everything sweet and put a little bit of salt and everything savor you put a little bit of sugar always add a little bit of salt to your cookie dough I have flour but it also have ground-up chestnuts you can buy chestnuts in the jar or you can roast them fresh to take the chestnuts you grind them up in a food processor and you'll end up with chestnut flour that's gonna give your hamentashen super holiday flavor so in this bowl there's flour and there's chestnut flour just want to take this mix it all up take the flour you dump it onto a parchment grab it by the corners and now you won't make a mess now you're gonna mix it until it's just incorporated if you overmix it the flour gets really tough and then you get chewy cookies want your Cookie to be really tender now the last little bit of mixing you're gonna do do it by hand just incorporate all those loose pieces we don't want to over mix add oh okay just like a real Baker want you to take a little bit of flour about this much you're just gonna throw it into the bowl then you're going to take this guy just scrape underneath and you'll be able to get the whole mass out in one lock put a little bit more flour cookies are very temperamental too much flour you're going to ruin it just enough so that the plastic doesn't stick you're going to turn the dough out on the plastic and you're going to push it down with their hands because we're going to do a cinnamon trick that's going to give it a swirl but first we have to get in shape I'll just Pat it down nice and gentle okay so right now Sarah is making a pace the mixture of 121 cinnamon and sugar alright cool salix good you go thank you now all this cinnamon onto one side of the dough we are gonna swirl the cinnamon so when we roll it out we're gonna get these really cool swirls press it's kind of like a cinnamon roll it's full of cinnamon and it's rolled up but it's a hamentashen grab the plastic just fold this over full it again cinnamon and a hamentashen my mom's gonna see this and punch me in the face she's gonna be so mad I'm gonna get a call from the rabbi is gonna be like Duff you made the beautiful cookie if it's not Jewish gonna stick that in the fridge let it show so we got our hamentashen dough in the fridge and getting nice and chill so we'll be able to roll it out now we're gonna make the film traditionally hamentashen have something like prunes or apricot or even poppy seed filling for the holidays we're gonna go apples and spices so we can start with a little bit of butter slip that in there okay get it all melty brown sugar and a little bit of sherry perfect nutmeg and now apples now we got a caramel base sherry sauce going on and we're just gonna cook these down was gonna get nice and mushy and liquid ok so these apples been cooking for about 15-20 minutes are nice and broken down and really soft all that sherry flavor and nutmeg really got in there it's now we can add our extra ingredients so you can take some pecans and just fold them in I would just do like a handful maybe a handful and a half Alex right and then for applesauce the applesauce and the pecans are really going to add a lot of texture the pecans are gonna had a lot of crunch the applesauce is gonna make it really smooth so I'm gonna put this filling in a bowl let it cool and then it'll be ready to fill the cookies meantime let's get tore down all right let's see how our swirl turned out excited I am it's all cinnamon sugar in here I'm gonna cut this down about 12 pieces all right so here's how you make this cookie you can take each one of these little rolls that you made you can flatten it out you're gonna roll it till it's about quarter of an inch you're gonna cut it with the cutter put a little tiny bit of filling on you don't need too much filling if you put too much it's gonna go out all over the place it's not gonna close right just enough filling you're gonna fold the corners together you're gonna make a three corner little hat the cookie doesn't have to keep its spiral shape you just want to make sure that it's distinct from the dough around it that's good looking cookie alright so these cookies supposed to look just like this so let's get these cold and then we'll egg wash all right here's the cookies have some cold cold no just egg wash these nice and gentle okay we got the egg wash on these cookies are gonna go in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes look at those okay now these are cool we can do our drizzle we're gonna put a praline drizzle that Sarah made on top it's got butter brown sugar cream vanilla a little bit of sherry you know putting a drizzle on your cookies really gives it just an extra holiday touch these are great idea really nice mm-hmm I'm more interested in eating them uh-huh mm-hmm oh babe

right yeah every was a key welcome and alive hey you know we uh we've gotten a lot of that incredible feedback on that www Food Network thing and you know we'd all like to eat a little lighter this saying a little healthier huh I know what you're thinking you thinking hey Emeril come on that healthy stuff tastes like cardboard I used to really think like that but um tonight what I'd like to do is show you a few tricks that I have uh just sort of learned and kind of just sort of lighten up a few of those classics little healthier versions if you will of the classics this is that you love but without losing any flavor that's what we're going to try to do tonight kind of zero in on that saturated stuff you know now speaking about classic flavor give it up for our special musical guests Neil Giraldo is in the house oh yeah and his wife is a really really big foodie so I like to bring her out please give it up for Tyler we're cooking why did it have you having to be here are you ready I'm ready we are rocking out with healthy classics tonight right here on Emeril live yeah are you doing welcome nice to have you see these aren't the cheap seats huh how you doing mom well it's great to have you guys in the house so excited I wish we were like doing Italian food or something no but anyhow we're gonna we're gonna kick it up a few notches real simple I'm gonna stop with a little bit of a salad actually made with romaine hots a romaine but before I do that well I mean by hots of romaine well I just took those beautiful little romaine heads made these little wedges like this okay little wedges and we got oh you had set it back to here we got to have some sort of pork fat even though we're trying to we're trying to get lighter you know so I said to myself self exactly and then all of a sudden this Canadian bacon thing came into my head you know that's free lean it's like a fifth of regular bacon not that we're counting that much but all right so we're going to crisp up a little bit of Canadian bacon that I diced up very very lean doesn't have a lot of fat and we're going to stop with that we've got our romaine and then I thought we need some croutons so what I'm going to do is um drizzle some olive oil on a little bit of these slice croutons that I sliced from a bag yet this is like when you want to use good olive oil and all right so we got that now for me I like a little garlic you can do it yeah I mean come on that's healthy for ya you know and we need recipes like this and they say get a clove of garlic and rub the crouton do you guys believe that no you know you read those recipes get a clove of garlic and why don't you just wave it over it like that you know I mean hey if you're gonna use some garlic come on get some garlic out here and like just give them a little garlic like this right spread it like that don't deprive them so I'm gonna garlic up the croutons gonna visit with Pat Neal a little bit when we come back another knot stick around see at home I pretty much do all the cooking he did my husband doesn't yell fizz all the evening our kitchen at home obviously has all the accoutrements that she would need we're out here on the bus were really limited cooking out here as a challenge want to sit down here next to me you know it's been 25 years and I've been took it on the bus for at least 20 of them so I don't know I think I can cook anywhere now I know this place you have two burners on this bus and no ovens with thermals it's just a cooking show I think that probably the most ambitious things that I made don't judge alleged crepes there with caramelized sugar so that was uh I was pretty amazing you can be now hey give it up yeah why did to have you man wanted to have you guys so close the lovely wife Pat Benatar in the house ladies and gentlemen yes indeed hey 25 years that's a miracle to begin with I take my hat off for that I mean that God bless it's a beautiful thing 9 times nominated for a Grammy four-time Grammy Award winning and a new album out go check it out all right yes hey you at home go by about 400 copies where you currently neighbourhood on yes all right now I've got this pasta dish I'm under a lot of pressure here right now that's a great cook so I'm gonna get the salad out of the way so I can move on to know another healthy alternative all right first of all I want to make a simple dressing I roasted some garlic one of the tips that I Toyota's going to share with you is that you want to get when you're doing this type of lower saturated fat lower fat cooking you still want to get the flavor so you got to look for little things to punch the flavors roasted garlic being one of them okay lemon lemons another thing that comes to mind curry if you like that cayenne pepper you got to have things that just sort of just pop the flavors now another thing that I think is misrepresented which I'm going to use to make this dressing is that when you instantly say to people we're going to use buttermilk they go you know and buttermilk really is a one of those alternative things that you can use because it doesn't have butter in it it's really almost like a yogurt so it's kind of really delicious so we got the roasted garlic in there orange zest different citrus peels zests flavors work I'm going to use a little orange and this is that mayonnaise you could use low-fat mayonnaise if you want it's all up to you lots of fresh herbs of a good thing you get a lot of impact I'm using a lot of parsley and I'm going to use a lot of chives in there and then simply now what I'm going to do I'm ready to put this thing together what we're going to do now is we're going to add the buttermilk in here and a real real simple dressing little salt some pepper like I said you could use cayenne and really kick it up if you want you could use crushed pepper all right now what we're going to do put this thing on here now if we wanted to uh multiply this a little bit more you know like if you have oil and vinegar it's like a vinaigrette but if you add an egg and then you add oil you have an emulsion like mayonnaise was so we already got an emulsion in that because we used a little bit of that low-fat mayonnaise yeah didn't you see them on the back of the barn alright all you low fat chickens stand up just kidding alright look on a serious note I'm putting this together now I got my romaine the inner side the outer edges that I just chopped up okay got a seasoned em I don't know what you get your romaine where I get mine and don't come seasoned little salt and pepper get our croutons about eight minutes for them and here's how we'll simply put this together nice platter white salad take the romaine put some on that side and some on this side now nice white bacon a little bit of tomatoes really light just will use a little olive oil make them even a little lighter practically flying out of my hand right now and then we'll just use a little bit of those light Tomatoes like this and then we'll take the croutons put a few of those stacks over here alright now we could either do two things we could dress the greens or we could just use a little olive oil toss them up then the salad dressing so we'll just go a little that way we'll go a little this way we'll go a little that way that way and this is so light it's unbelievable there you have it okay folks little lights our I know you're surprised no Parmesan cheese hey it's light I'm going to put some of these light croutons in here for texture all right now we were talking about how we love pasta so much so there's a nice pasta that there's kind of big strips like this called pompe del pompe del noodles but if you go in light and you want to stay light with the pasta dish thing what you can do is use zucchini this is really a fantastic dish with a mandoline or shop knife this mandolin cut on a long way like this to see that Pat it just kind of kind of can go as long as you want and basically as long as the zucchini doesn't have a lot of heavy seeds you can sort of like use this as noodles okay yeah so now here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take some olive oil mmm that's when you use the knob you don't use your knob high medium medium low you gotta use your knob now ladies keep it G back there please we have a guest alright so now what we're going to do is we want to flavor this oil but you see the Pens not streaking hot right now right it's not all hot because I used the knob but what we want to do is before this gets hot we want to flavor see garlic burns people make a big mistake they turn the skillet on they got it on high it's like ready to jump off the stove it's so high they add the garlic it's burned in two seconds and then they wonder why everything tastes bitter so what we do is we start and when you start hearing it just kind of sizzle like that like it's doing now you can flavor the oil even better I was telling you earlier about certain spices ingredients right crush red pepper see we're going to get the flavor right out of that a little bit of green onion oh yeah babe or scallion you would call right see we're getting the flip we're not cooking them all out now what we're going to do is we're going to start layering our noodles of zucchini and then what we're going to do is we're just gonna sort of lightly doesn't that look good ah oh wait oh wait it does smell good that's why I'm telling them people at home they got to get smellivision you know get with the program you don't have smell-o-vision I call you cable company and complain look a little salt mm-hmm little pepper now here's what we do something very very light a little remove we just add a little bit of that just for just for flavor just for flavor and what I do now is I just take a little just a little ragu like this of tomato and we're just going to let it sort of trap in there and sort of steam it and keep all the nice healthy stuff in there and when we come back I'll show you what it looks like stick around don't touch that dial we'll be right back we could take a chill baby oh sweet right Neels absolute job while I'm doing this is to get really hungry hey I'm starving be open the why's it gets a little chance to breathe so we could enjoy it and see put on some kind of great music which is either Pavarotti or Louie prima or something like that that makes a good gig this is a really simple dish this is just basically a chicken dish that has white wine garlic cum lot of olives and fresh basil in a little bit I basically make this with dark meat because it stays much more tender and because we have we're limited to how we can prepare it it's it's kind of a braised dish nicer room seeds falling all over bone perfect enemy Tonya major you might pasta and you're just keeping it warm and then you just kind of put it together it's really evening we're total foodies everything we do is around food out of your soul long we've been out for ten and a half weeks you just you can't eat any more food that's not home-cooked you get crazy it's so good simple food oh it's just so good enough that's all we're married this long uh-huh all things can fade but cooking never dies I could help you count the minutes so your next great meal on the bus Neels are all over the band and the missus in the house Pat Benatar yes indeed alright this thing is getting so white I'm about fading away here a little bit of tomato remember I told you earlier about those fresh herbs a little chervil parsley chives and a little basil as much as you like now I'm just going to fold this in you just want the herbs to just just for a minute just get that flavor out and then basically will serve the zucchini pasta dish here it does look good huh it's light too and basically what you could always do to enhance it a little bit you could always just do a little essence like this around Pam like that just just to kind of you know what I can't take it being so light just a little just a little goes a long way right all right when we come back Neil Drago Pat Benatar and I another that stick around right yeah UCD is called go like go get it talking about a little flavor pops these Roma tomatoes that you can buy year round cut them in half season with salt and pepper cover them with olive oil and you slow roast them in the oven and they really can do wonderful things for pasta pizza salads maybe 50 minutes to an hour 300 degrees get the juices going all right so now I got to put you on the spot pal want to help me cook yeah all right come on Pat Benatar all right so for Grammys oh thanks but as I got pine nuts okay and um you don't have to chop them too much but I was gonna do this filo you and I do this little layer I know feel me feel oh that's it it's hard to work with filo but look we got this guy here in New York it's not that regular filo stuff this guy well we're gonna wearing it together I trust you but I thought what we would do is we'd make a little pizza and so if you could just put a rough chop on that and then we'll bring one layer out on the cutting board of the filo and you could brush it with olive oil okay and then we could sprinkle a bit of the pine nuts on that that would be great I'm with Anna feel free whenever you want to kick it up you know just go ahead just go ahead and now I got this today down at the the Old Market I saw this funny-looking spinach isn't had some funny looking spinach I mean then I first looked at it I went hmm dandy line but I tasted it and it was really really delicious but of course I don't really want to walk to use too much of the stems that so what I'm gonna do is I'm just got the oven on low or the stove on low I should say and I'm gonna just sort of take this spinach oh yeah that's good that's perfect like that and now what we'll do is I'm gonna stop will turn that and see I have this covered here Pat because when people work with phyllo dough if they don't um they don't cover it with a damp towel it gets all brittle E and that's some of the big problems that people have so I'm going to do a little layer of that for you right there and then you want to add a little bit of moisture to this and so that's where the olive oil comes in so if you want to just lightly brush it and then a little pine nuts like that maybe we could do like three layers of that while I'm over here on spinach detail I know all these but I thought it would be worth this intense flavor of the spinach with this this sort of organic spinach it tasted really good so hopefully it'll end up tasting good all right so the stems you could say for I don't know maybe you're raising some snails in the backyard or something I don't know so now that I have that and I have my heat on very very low that I'm wilt in this we could do one of two things we could add butter but we're keeping it light we could add a little olive oil that would be really good and uh are you making out over the time I'm good it looks like you're doing good things good so all right I'm coming to help you a little sprinkle another layer so folks what you want to do is try to get about three layers of this because what we're going to do is instead of using pizza dough we're going to use this phyllo dough like this you can see it doesn't have to be quite exact little salt then also what I did but that's just because of me I actually have so I actually have like a little um so how about if we do this a little olive oil hmm so light and a little h2o and we're just gonna kind of wilt this down a little bit now well you ready for me already wow that chicken dish look fantastic that you need for you it did I use doc I use the doc put together it keeps it more tender alright so the reason for our madness Pat and I here what we're doing is we're gonna we got three layers now we got this little bowl like this and what we'll do is we'll just go around Pat and sort of make a circle like we're making a pizza round and we'll keep it keep it as close as we can okay and meanwhile what I'm gonna do here now is I'll take this wilted spinach you don't have to cook it that much yeah yeah cooking what Pat Bennett he's cooking with me that's great so I'm just gonna shock this spinach you don't have to cook it very long turn the heat off and what do I mean by that well see I'm I got a little ice bath here and when you do that you shock it real good but also what happens it's vulnerable right now so it just like took in even more water and spinach has a lot of water so what you want to do is after its shocked you know no ice we're going to squeeze out make sure it's good and cold how you doing great so now this is what happens we put those on the on a parchment paper lined sheet pan and we're going to bake them off for about 12 minutes at about 350 degrees you don't have to worry about doing that that's the great thing about having an awesome kitchen staff you see now Pat what we do is we got that spinach like that this is what the filos look like when they come out of the oven see they got a little poofy like that just a little bit so now what we're going to do is we're going to use this as sort of some light pizza okay that's gonna be like well you'll see roasted garlic you can't roast that on the bus huh no no oven we're gonna have to get some connection now ready a conduction next time we're gonna get some connection some are uh you know you're gonna cook for Neil and I'll just fed actually a care package and and forget the oven you know okay so here we go pack now that we've got this here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take um you have that brush yep who brush it one more time on the top perfect and then what we'll do is now we'll add a little bit of spinach like this that we blanched okay stems hmm little bit of spinach like that guy you want to do another one and then here's the reason for the lightness that Pat and I right now we're doing very light very light practically down Fifth Avenue right now we're gonna add a couple of cloves of this roasted garlic on the spinach like this okay and then Pat and I are going to put them in the oven for about doesn't take that long maybe about six minutes when it comes out we're going to flavor it with a little bit of oregano and some feta cheese for our light pizza all right that's when we come back okay stick around we'll be right back not gonna tire everybody all right hey welcome back everybody Hills wrong all in the band one of the greatest sous chefs on the planet Pat Benatar ladies and gentlemen so you know those oven tomatoes that we are that we didn't so we put a few of those on but let me let me show you what we did during the commercial break and then we're going to get into a sort of a little lighter style gumbo that I'm going to show you how to do so look at this we got these sort of pizza things going on so now what we do Pat little oregano then we do a little crush pine nut like that you had earlier yeah really nice and then instead of using the other will use this feta cheese because it's good and light I'm not making this stuff up come on work with me so a little feta cheese like that and then just to sort of finish it what we do Pat is this we'll just kind of take a little bit more olive oil hmm all right for me since we got it light I'm just gonna hit it with a little pepper all right now we're gonna put this back in the oven all right so this goes in the oven and we got our little white pizza now like the hottest thing to make light is like gumbo cuz Gumbo's gumbo ho so here's a trick that I wanted to show you and whether you want to keep it light or not first of all we're going to keep it shellfish fish shellfish light you know how we always take when you make the roux cuz the whole secret with gumbo is all in the room so we take equal pots of vegetable oil I would use butter but vegetable oil right light and then instead of adding that what we've done to sort of get more flavor out of it is we are a head of time we've toasted the flour you can do this this has done a lot in Louisiana to speed up the process of those doc roux Gumbo's but you need an oven yes and so you can do that now it doesn't take it takes like a good hour I want to have to do this but it's speeds it up and you get all this wonderful flavor all ready to start now too much flour you add a little bit of oil like this until we get that but look at the color already packed well it's about 350 degrees and you know Rouge shouldn't be so thick thick thick it should be spreadable like that but look Oh already to color folks on that okay I mean we're they're ready just from toasting it in the oven all right now we can start with the Trinity so we've got onion and we've got celery and we've got bell pepper now we got to let this cook one thing with the vegetables Oh a little bit of salt can you hand me that Cayenne right there Pat please salt and we're going to use cayenne pepper to spice it up now one of the things about the vegetables here got to let them cook 8 to 10 minutes get the flavor out after 8 to 10 minutes what we're going to do is we're going to add about 30 cloves of garlic hey it's healthy I add a couple of bay leaves and a little bit of thyme so what we're going to do is we've got fish stock and we've got clam juice after the garlic we're going to add okra that I cut fresh okra okay tomatoes and then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to use pieces of gumbo crabs like this inside for that flavor okay but guess what guess what I gotta wait eight to ten minutes so I got a ask you think you could like sing a song for that minute our way your nose contagious yes danger then you fashion into perspective Oh when we tag watch the song will you think of Roble yeah like I said earlier go like go get it yeah speaking about that listen to this that gum but once you add oakley you add the tomatoes then you put the crabs in a the crabs going to give it all this nice flavor but it's also delicious that takes about 45 minutes to an hour that's where I'm at right here in a nice little simmer smell I love now loving it now if you want to kick it up a notch lighter like we're going to do now when it does that we're going to add the shrimp we're going to add some crabmeat we're going to add some oysters and some green onions and a little bit of parsley and then look we don't have to cook this very long we're just going to get that love thing going in there taste it season it speaking about what we made watch how beautiful these are oh yeah you thought we forgot about them huh no way talk about a great little snack look how light these are they're practically floating to you so you just have it that and what I like to do is you can just sort of drizzle it can cut it with a little pizza wheel if you want drizzle with a little olive oil and that's that sorry Pat oh yeah I got a you know a little a little hot yeah we'll save that as weak safer boom by now you got a serve gumbo with rice my opinion sassafras on the side hot sauce on the side it's just one of those things you got to do remember the seafood has like a built-in thermometer you don't have to once you add the shrimp and it starts cooking you don't have to cook it much longer you serve a little bit of that light gumbo like that then see how nice that color is because of that flour that we toasted a little bit of rice little green onions and hopefully you all got a healthier choice tonight right folks all right want to thank the guys in the vein good friend of course Neil Giraldo want to thank him Pat Benatar thanks for joining me see see I've got yeah
okay gimme that thank you very much and thank you all for coming great turnout um a couple reasons why I'm here um first of all being part of the Macy's culinary team and culinary Council I thought what a great way to have an afternoon to share with you my latest book kick up sandwiches it came out exactly a week ago and it's been a lot of fun um the people that I have shared with last week I launched on Good Morning America and then I was on the chew and the view and the Rachel show it's amazing to me how close especially in America how close sandwiches are to our culture because it doesn't really matter what culture we come from we all have some sort of sandwich memory that we can relate to I certainly have a few of them which I share in the book growing up in Fall River in Massachusetts Portuguese descent so and french-canadian so I share those but as I have been very fortunate to travel not only in this country but you know in the world this seems to always be a sandwich connection no matter if you're in France or in Vietnam this there's this connection of a sandwich a memory of a sandwich and so I decided to to take those memories particularly of my own on and of course my culinary team are not only here in Orlando but also in New Orleans and and throughout our organization and sort of pull what kind of sandwiches with some of the favors today I'm very very simple we're doing a classic Monte Cristo which those of you that have been around a little bit it's hard to find a Monte Cristo these days they used to be very popular 20 years ago on restaurant menus and on lunch counters and and diners and now your high press to really find the classic Monte Cristo anymore at least on the right way and then secondly what I've been really really surprised about in launching this book a week ago but in all the research and particularly we did something really unique and that is that we we sort of went and found the best bloggers in the country and some of you are in the room right now but we went and found some of the best bloggers who are really into food not just like great bloggers but really into food and really take it very seriously and what we found out is I have found out not only this past week but doing all the research for this great book was how many families use a sandwich and a soup at least once a week as a dinner and as dinner at home it's fast it really is great of quality that you want to put into the sandwich of the soup as well as it's very economical and practical and certainly it's pretty easy for the for the kids to to want to take and participate in that so first of all I want to thank the bloggers secondly I want to thank all of you most importantly for being here and all right let's get started shall we um so the first sandwich we need we need a batter um so you can do this a couple different ways and what I learned when I first won the sandwich of course we used eggs and so these days there's obviously allergies coming out the wazoo and really truly actually my daughter's just launched a two weeks ago their first book on gluten-free cooking uh so many people have so yak disease right now it's mind-blowing we have to make adjustments in a restaurant which who would have thought about that 10 years ago of doing like a gluten-free pizza or gluten-free dishes but anyhow so no eggs we're going to use we're just going to use strictly a few different dry ingredients and we can always add and I will add but flour that I have a little seasoning in here so salt and then baking powder and baking soda totally optional if you don't think that you're going to keep this more than a day on then you really don't really have to use the baking soda the baking powder I'm using because I want to get that little bit of puffiness that is what it's going to do as a natural leavening agent so we'll just sort of mix that up and then I'm going to use a beer um you don't have to use a beer you can use milk I thought hey listen Macy's is paying ability why sprouts first I use two beers who knows so the consistency of this should be really almost as great we're saying we're talking only a grater same well it's kind of like a good tempura batter right it should just about coat of spoon it shouldn't be too thick but it should be just a nice consistency and you can always spit it out as you begin now in the in the book um there's also a fabulous section for breads because I think when you think about sandwiches right it's not just about like ham and cheese you know it's not just about like baloney and cheese or baloney although there's nothing wrong with a great baked baloney sandwich I can tell you that but really those components are the bread um and these days you have a lot of choices because there are so many great artisanal bakeries out there that are doing really really awesome so you can go that route or you can go into the section that's in kicked-up sandwiches and there's a whole thread section for basic two-week - multigrain pumpernickel etc etc if you want to choose to go that rope and do your own bread the the other great section that's in there um and it's worth I mean of course it's great sandwiches what is the condiment section spoon it up is also what we call it in there because we tell you about how taking really really simple staples like mayonnaise whether you buy it or whether you make it and what you can do with them to really kick up your sandwiches ah something as simple as like ricotta cheese which is on every supermarket shelf and how you can sort of flavour those things to really sort of kick up your sandwiches - anyhow there's a whole book of condiments in there and and and toppings and salad dressings etc that you should check out that's really really awesome third is obviously what are you putting in it so whether it's a simple egg salad sandwich which believe it or not was one of the almost number one blogged sandwiches in this little thing that we did which blew my mind because I mean I didn't think that egg salad would be that interesting to people but when it goes to show me when you have a great recipe something as simple as egg salad done right and done to taste delicious people are going to get excited about that um and then of course beside that inside is where I was really talking about is really the preparation whether you keep it simple plain whether you toast it whether you griddle it what are you griddle it on a machine whether you griddle it on a stone in this case we're using our great sort of Macy's pot here which is sort of a thing that we've done exclusive for them to sort of right we're doing it in a to fry the sandwich believe it or not you can griddle it and if you want to do that but there's nothing wrong with frying if you fry right okay the whole key of frying right is the temperature okay people out there think that frying oh my god I'm gonna I in my veins in my nerves and this has been all be applauded and all my goodness and you know if you fry bad then you should talk like that but if you fry right you don't really have to have to worry and it's all about really the temperature and how you do that if you're going to fry on the stovetop as we are today as opposed to a fryer you want to make sure that the oil is about 50% of the what I call the weight in the pot because it's going to expand whether we put shrimp in there or catfish or whether we're going to put a Monte Cristo in there that it's important that we sort of keep that together all right very simple innards good roast turkey good ham this is an uncute ham a good American cheese not that processed crap that's out there and good American cheese okay good ingredients make great food make great sandwiches very very simple condiments so we have our bread and basically for this what we're going to do is we're going to take a little bit of mayonnaise or as much as you like some people are not mayonnaise fans that's okay but we want to give as I say in the book to spread a chance to really sort of show itself the other thing that I also like beside that is is adding a little bit of mustard this is a DeJohn mustard I don't think that you have to add a lot but I think the combination of this really makes this to be a simple but yet delicious sandwich and then from there what we're going to do is we're going to start with the cheese first and then we're going to start with the roast turkey and you see you know just this also as simple as a sandwich there's also a technique that goes with this too to make it work to make it all stay together it's not just throwing everything in between two slices of bread if you want to do that go on a fishing trip going up you know on a picnic oh that you don't really care about and then we're going to take the ham and really just want to lay that and then we're going to come back with the top layer of cheese as I said what is very important for this particular sandwich is really pressing this pressing it is very important and don't mind getting your hands dirty now the key then the next thing is soft butter it really and particularly if you're going to griddle this as opposed to frying it if you're going to griddle this you really want to make sure that the butter is soft it's not going to tear the bread up and shouldn't tear the bread up and you want to make sure that you distribute it evenly which is why you have a sandwich spreader or you could use a good butter knife pressing it really really good as I said is very is very key and then once it's pressed then you can griddle it or fry it with this particular thing what we would do now is take it dip it inside of our battle check your batter before you're going to do this as you can see now our batter is getting thick as it's sitting there it's just because it's relaxed it's the way that it's going to do which is what you can always add to thin it out which is perfect now a trick that Gregg and I were just talking about in Barnard before I came out was for this particular sandwich it's really important that the proteins sort of solidify again so we have the proteins the meats the cheese that we've sort of relaxed as we have made the sandwiches okay but not what we want to do is we want to take and we want to take those proteins and you can either wrap them so you can do it ahead of time or we want to put it back in the refrigerator so that they really solidify because then what you want to be able to do is to be able to really just sort of dip that inside of the sandwich and write what you want to do then just we we have got this out we're going to just sort of pack this dry a little bit I don't know if you ever had a Monte Cristo but preserves a some sort of Jam was always sort of a centerpiece or a mama later whether you like raspberry orange whatever you like the other thing was I never could imagine why powdered sugar would be sprinkled on a sandwich like that I could never figure that out and then I figured out that the whole key to that is that if you did fry bad the powdered sugar covered it up and so you really couldn't you couldn't really so look you're just a little bit like that and maybe another another layer sort of like this listen that look great right here with me you
thank you thank you yeah so we're doing it yeah got it yeah got the green light you're go what do you think I think yeah okay we're going to head our launch day say yes to getting business done let us help with money and though American Express open

with liquid plumbers power to destroy the toughest clogs there's a plumber in all of us
what's up guys thanks for joining me here I'm damned Langan tonight it's all about the cake you guys can see I've got breakfast on the brain I created this entirely edible satin pancakes huge shagging pancakes the whole thing the cake a lot of fun to put together I want to show you guys just how I did it so let me get this huge pain cream cake out of the way I'll put it right here for a reference and I'll grab another cake that I've prepared this is a lemon blueberry cake or a lemon berry cake the recipe for Remy Sheratons you guys can check it out and what I did was just fill this cake with vanilla buttercream let it chill overnight and I have it on a base and connected to my base is a piece of copper tubing the copper tubing is connected to the bottom of the base copper tubing is completely food safe that's what your water runs through in your refrigerator so it's great to use for structure for cakes so to make this gigantic pancake cake first thing I have to do is roll out some tan colored or I guess batter colored fondant so I wrote up some snakes of fun and I did this ahead of time - huh expedite this process and after I rolled up snakes of fondant kind of regularly what I did was just flatten them down a little bit with my hands really simple because when we create these pancakes what we're really doing is just creating just the very edge so this huge pancake cake right here is actually cake on the inside the only solid pancake is belongeth on top so it's kinda like an optical illusion so once I have you know my my takes the fondant rolled out what I want to do is dust and very top of them and that's going to give the look that these were you know like on the grill or on the griddle whatever you call the thing to cook your pancakes on so to get this nice brown color actually just mix together some yellow food dust and some Dutch process cocoa powder so it's just like a nice natural color and I'm just brushing this in nice and heavy and then I'll use another brush to get rid of all these like little excess bits of dust that are now on the sides so if you guys are enjoying this video if your friends are into cakes and baking share this video you can check it out later share it on one of your friends walls so they could check it out and enjoy it and you guys know I love talking baking and cakes and answering all of your questions so if you have any questions about what I'm doing or questions about cakes are baking whatever you guys want to know I'll leave those questions in the in the comments below and if you are looking for the recipe for this cake this lemon berry cake it should be sharing the comments yeah sharing comments good you guys can check that out there cool so you guys can see I'm just brushing the top here with this dust another what I do is just take another kind of pastry brush and just use it to get rid of all of the excess look at my original brush back to because I want the edges to stay fairly just like light tan like I only really want this color on the very top of the tank what I'm going to do is grab my pizza cutter and I'm going to get to pancake slices out of each one of these little tubes right here so if you guys want to check out my facebook the link to my facebook is at the top of this video it's baked by day and you can also check me out on Instagram I post a lot of cool stuff there usually before I do these lives here on the Food Network Facebook page I usually have a story or my own serum that shows like in process photos of how I got the cake ready so follow me on Facebook and Instagram you know since I'm Ganesha alright so I'll take my cake and I'll decide which is my front I think this is my front because I like where the syrup bottles going to be here with where this copper tube is so what I'll do is take out my first piece my first piece of fondant and I'm basically just going to wrap it around and I want that light colored side facing out and then I'll just stretch the two pieces to meet in the back and kind of push them together with my hands I'll bring all of the seams to the very back of the cake and then I'll cover them up with some syrup drips so you really won't even see them once the whole thing is put together so we'll do that again so I also think it was pretty advantageous to to roll this fondant out ahead of time because it kind of set up a little bit by it's pretty warm here today in Pennsylvania actually so fondant is sweating it's really soft cakes or soft so I'm just taking a sharp paring knife right here and I'll just cut the edge flat and then I'll just push these two edges together and I do want to try and keep some space in between them I don't want all the pancakes to sit perfectly flat on top of each other because let's not help antiques rolls so you know so I'll just make sure this is nice and adhered to the cake and the buttercream is pretty sticky so I don't need to you know really like what's this fondant but if the fun that wasn't sticking I would just read it with a little bit of water so let me take you back down here that's how the first two pancakes go and I'll just show you again how I got this color so I'll take one of my ivory colored pieces of fondant and I'm just dusting the very top with my mixture of cocoa and yellow food coloring so if you guys are just joining we are creating this epic sack of blueberry pancakes that are being covered with a gravity-defying drizzle of syrup it's pretty cool it's pretty sweet cake literally and inside the cake is a lemon blueberry layer cake so unless I forget um I'll cut into the cake you guys can see what it looks like alright so dusting the top here just to get that color that look as if these pancakes were really cooked on the grill and then just getting rid of that extra dust to keep my keep the side of my pancakes ice and just ivory-colored and I'll grab my pizza cutter cut it straight down the middle so if you guys create cakes yourself if you're a cake artist we'd love to check out some photos of what you've created so share pictures in the comments below if you guys have any of them if you have an idea for a really sweet cake for next time something else you would like to see in one of our broadcasts let me know in the comments so I decided to make blueberry pancakes because blueberry pancakes are my favorite I pretty much love anything blueberry like blueberry pancakes or blueberry muffins totally my jam but you certainly could use whatever kind of fruit you want for this guys let me know in the comments below what your favorite pancake accompaniment is alright so you guys can see this does take a little bit of time and another detail that I like to add are these kind of air bubbles like these little imperfections on the side of the pancake so pancakes in Baker's terms would be considered like a quick bread because they get their leavening from usually baking powder maybe Basin soda but basically they cook from the heat of the pan right so there's always these cool about air bubbles in them on the sides because a basically cake so I'm just using a ball tool and a Dresden tools what it's called a little sculpting tool just to put some little holes and things on the sides looks a little more realistic I think you can also kind of drag a line sideways so if you guys would follow my work you'll know that I'm totally into these gigantic food cakes certainly my Jam's though last week we created a huge avocado it was pretty cool they were like alright so let me go here again I'll grab another circle my fondant that I've dusted with cocoa powder so you get the top nice and brown nice and like griddle Brown and I'll just stretch the strip around so the two ends meet in the back and I'll just kind of pinch those little ends together my focus is really the front so this is the front here so I just want to make sure that each pancake is meeting up with the pancake shirt below it good looks good right going for another one so tonight I'm using marshmallow fondant a lot of people ask me would take a fun that I like to use and usually I make my own fondant just because I use so much fun and it's easier to make it it's also cheaper so if you guys are looking for a really cool fondant recipe just search online marshmallow fondant it's pretty easy to work with it tastes really good because it's basically 50% marshmallow sauce if you like marshmallows you'll like marshmallow fondant and whenever I'm kneading my fondant or rolling my fondant out I like to use a little bit of vegetable shortening my hands to kind of add a little more moisture a little more flexibility to define it keeps it from cracking awesome starting to like a stack of pancakes all right so let's bring it back here I'll show you guys again you guys are just joining how I'm getting this color so I've rolled out some ivory colored fondant about 24 inches long because I needed to sit around my 8 inch cake so 24 inches plus a little bit of stretch kind of gets me where I need to be so after I roll up my fondant strip I have some cocoa powder that I've mixed with just a little bit of yellow petal dust on my paintbrush here and I'm just painting on the very top of this shirt and then I'm going to cut this shirt in half so to create this pancake cake you guys will see in just a few moments to get the gravity-defying effect it's holding my little syrup cup I actually just used quarter inch copper pipe or copper tubing you can find it at any hardware store it's completely food safe because it's what your water runs through in your house you like in your plumbing and it's pretty sturdy it's easy to shape so it's great for Kate structure but it can hold a good amount of weight so good stuff to use if you're into building like grab you find okay all right so after have the top of this stripped off did I'll just cut in half doesn't have to be perfect the more variation that is in this strip the more variation I'll get in with in cakes right so I'll just pick this up bring around you have any questions so far now the questions the questions to start and show me operator all right so get these strips to meet in the back push them together whenever you're wrapping fondant around a cake there's always a good bit of stretch so like I said I kind of just take the sides of the cake this is an 8 inch cake multiply it by 3 get 24 inches and then 24 inches plus a little bit stretch gets me completely around my cake so it looks like just about two more will get us all the way around so before I move on I'll go back to what I was doing earlier here I'm just using a ball tool just to make little air bubbles in my pancake because the size of pancakes always have those little fluffy little bubbles on greatly bubbles quick tip if you guys are big pancake lovers like I am if you have you know a favorite pancake recipe and you're looking to kick it up a notch next time you make your pancakes separate your eggs add the egg yolks to the pancake batter as normal and then whip the egg white so it's just a touch of sugar so like a medium peak and then fold those egg whites into your batter your pancakes will be fluffier and because I've ever dreamed super easy step takes just a couple more minutes and it really just kicks your pancakes up a notch so try not next time so if you guys are just joining I'm Dan Lang and I'm from baked by day and you can check out my facebook page at the top of this you can also check me out on instagram at baked by Dan if you're really into these cool cake creations share this video leave any questions you guys may have in the comments below and if you're looking for the recipe for you take them using tonight it is a lemon berry cake since I'm making blueberry pancakes you can find that recipe pinned at the top of the comments so I'm just wrapping you strips of fondant around the cake my cake is nice and cold its frosted with buttercream but you guys know I really like in Osh juice so ganache would work for this pretty much anything solid I or anything to get some solid on in the in the refrigerator so sometimes it's helpful to use a sculpting tool to kind of push the edges of the fondant together if they're not really like meeting up but like I said this is kind of the back of the cake and I can cover this up with some syrup drips just like you have here so I'm not too worried about it all right so it looks like just one more strip should finish this up so let's see let's get this final trick we'll finish it up I think we're good I think we're golden just like these pancakes all right so in butter creams are getting soft cash so that's basically the making of a huge stack of pancakes pretty cool huh so just a few final details here before I put my top pancake on just a couple of air bubbles a little bit of texture here to make these look like they're nice and fluffy like they just came off the griddle right sweet so if you guys want to get notifications or find out ahead of time when we are doing these live tape broadcasts you can first off make sure that you like and subscribe to the food our Facebook page check out my facebook page 8 by dan and check me out on instagram at 8:10 because i always put something my story as i'm preparing for these cakes so you'll kind of get a little hand up listen tell me on my Instagram alright so I'm just going to clear my workspace and I just want to dust away all of this all this cocoa powder just won't get any cocoa powder on my top pancake as I'm rolling it out alright so Roman town pancakes super unique all going to do is take piece of fondant same color that I used to make all of my strips make sure these are all nice and attached awesome and before I even go to roll this out to take the fondant I'll kind of give it like a little pinch see if I'm going to get an 8 inch circle out of it looks a little small I'm going to add just a little more on to it I'll give this a nice meet whatever you guys are rolling fondant always want to be nice and stretchy see how this stretches like taffy or Bubblegum's not ripping not as important for rolling on a huge pancake but if I were going to be covering a cake in fondant and I needed it to be nice and flexible you stretch to the fondant will be really important so giving this a nice roll and then kind of like shaping a little bread loaf I'm just going to tuck all the fondant under to get rid of any creases or anything like that and then grab my cornstarch get a good bit of cornstarch on my table a little bit on top and I'm switching it up tonight I'm using the good old fashioned wooden rolling pin as opposed to my PVC pipe so I want this to stay really circular so every two or three turns I'm going to turn it just like an eighth of the way not even a quarter turn just a little turn it stays nice and circular and I want my top pancake to be really thick and really hearty looking since it's a great timing so I want to roll this too thin I'll stop in just a moment and check the measurement of it so you have a little air bubble not a deal I suppose a pancake would have air bubbles in it anyway right but the cake decorator and you can't not pop an air bubble when I see it on top of my cake all right so I'll grab my a cool thing over here and awesome I'm actually eight nine inches so eight inches on my cake or less the border of all my other pancakes should be perfect look at this just a few more rolls alright so now I'm going to do is just keep my sculpting tool and fine but I think looks like the center of the pancake and I'll make a little hole just as a guide for myself because what I need to do is fish this pancake over top of this one because you guys can see in this cake there's a pancake on top right so that's how I got it on there just guiding this over and I'll just stretch it into place oh yeah the crowning glory if any parts are too short a big deal I'll just stretch a little bit awesome right nice butter cream off my hands so the same deal I'll just add a little bit of texture to this since this is the final top pancake couple of air bubbles so this will seem or a little mark at the top is going to be completely covered by our syrup in just a moment so same deal I'll go back with my cocoa and I'll use nice like circular buffing motions to add some color to the top of this and then to add some real like char grill marks not charred gosh you would never want a pancake to be charged but to add some real color marks to the pancake I'm going to get my little creme brulee torch and hit just the top and sides of this cake for even more out color totally not necessary to use a creme brulee torch but anytime I can pull the torch out and kitchen I'm always down to do it so I figured that'd be a cool little effect for tonight alright so just taking this just to the very edge and all of this cocoa powder I'm going to have to brush away before I move on so if you guys are just joining right now I am dusting fondant to create the look of a pancake because we're making a gigantic stack of pancakes and of cake but the inside is a made of pancakes inside is made of a lemon blueberry cake and you can get that recipe at the top of the video all right so now away from my workspace I'm just going to dust off any excess no one said this was a tidy process cool dust off any little bits from the sides and then I'll just finish by the dusting off of my board alright gosh now I can get rid of this Coco confusing me because I'm looking at pancakes going to smell chocolate alright so let's do graph to do next next i have to grab my blowtorch so you can get this thing to light there we go so I'm just going to take the blowtorch and just hit the sides of this pancake just a little bit and you'll see that it starts to like brown and bubble up it's exactly them looking for just on the very edge so it's all the sugar in the fondant that allows this carmelization happen looks like I'm running out of you team but you guys get the point there all right so let me grab my maple colors modeling chocolate and I'm actually using modeling chocolate or I used modeling chocolate rather to create all these syrup tricks just because there's a lot of piecing together that goes on and modeling chocolate is really great for kind of like being seamless or being able to have seams the kind of healed of zone so the first thing you have to do is cover my copper tube with a big piece of modeling chocolate to come into the main setup report so I'm going to roll this out fairly thin like what's gonna happen interesting and it just needs to be the length of this piece of copper tube right here and I don't need to add any type of person X Pro layer I don't need to add any type of sticky anything to this copper you'll see that just by pressing it into the tube it sticks so the molotov chocolate totally just sticks in place and then I'll just pinch it around just little by little until the edges disappear until the tube disappears rather than the edges meet up and then I'm just going to use the palms of my hands to smooth out the seam so if you don't have modeling chocolate utility could use fondant for this modeling shop it's super easy mate I have a recipe my favorite recipe for modeling chocolate on my website as well so if you head to baking with Dan comm you can find it right just pinching isn't so the edges of the modeling-chocolate are the seams are completely together and then what I'm going to try and do is just with a really light touch I can't go too heavy here because it's super warm and this stuff is super soft but I just want to use the soft parts of my fingers and like the palm of my hand to kind of smooth this out all right that could be smoother but to move on I'll show you guys to make this syrup before I just want to roll out some of this modeling chocolate pretty skin so I'll start with a circle here I'll grab some cornstarch I need a good bit of cornstarch for this sort of thing put some on top okay in just our roll a circle and then cut out like a poor shape so really a regular circle hole Oh a poor shape that I'm looking for oh good let me grab a really sharp craft knife this is actually a scalpel so when I'm decorating cakes I really like to use scalpels because they stay so sharp you can find scalpels online they're actually about the same price as a regular krabby I and they just stay so sharp that they make cutting fun and modeling chocolate like super easy it's such a dream cutting modeling chocolate or fondant with a scalpel alright so same is when I put my top pancake on I'll find kind of like a center piece here I'll have to meet the hole little bit bigger I'm just going to fish this over my piece of copper tube lay it down there get rid of this cornstarch I'll press it into place and then what I really want to do is just soften this edge my modeling chocolate is moving around a little bit so just a little bit of vegetable shortening under it will make it just sticky enough to not move quick tip there all right so as I was saying just to kind of soften this edge here make it look a little more natural like an actual sarah forms going to take my finger just soften this edge a little bit right and then now I need to hide this seam right here I want it to look really natural like syrup is actually pouring on top of the pancakes so I'll take some this modeling chocolate again on a roll a little sausage please they're round they're kind of push it down just lightly kind of just insinuate that it's still kind of pouring out and then I'll just pinch this top part up so that it meets this main pour awesome alright so now what I want to do is add my little little syrup cup I don't know what you'll call I was going to call it a pour but that's to clean up it's called little uh mm syrup carafe I guess so this is just a cylinder modeling-chocolate the same brown color as the syrup and I paneled it in a piece of white modeling chocolate and chilled it until it's nice and cool so what I'm going to do here is just plunge the little cup right on to this copper tooth here there's this solid modeling chocolate it is solid modeling chocolate okay let me just look at the front here make sure it isn't seeing anything so I'm just going to add two little bits of modeling chocolate here just to kind of further reinforce that the syrup is actually pouring out of this little thing here that will smooth awesome so back down to this cerebrate here like I said I'm just using my fingers or the soft part of my hand just to smooth this out so now what I want to do is create a few larger serif drips just like here and don't forget I'll get to that handle in just a second that's kind of one of the last things I want to put on but to make some of these characters I'm going to take more modeling chocolate I'll just roll it until it's smooth and I want to roll a teardrop shape so I want to kind of get rid of any extra cornstarch here because I don't really want a lot of cornstarch on this otherwise it's not going to stick to the cake and that's not cool all right so teardrop shape rounded at the bottom cut one inch flat you can I'll attach this right here so to do this I'm just going to pinch one end so it's kind of flat attach it there and just press it into place and I'll flatten out the top because if it's dripping it'd be kind of flat here but then I'll try and meet the side nice and rounded right saj that seam out with my finger and I'm going to be brushing this modeling-chocolate with with vegetable oil or like cooking spray to make it nice and shiny so since the modeling chocolate is fact-based it really likes to be brushed risk vegetable oil get nice and shiny because less oil to that and that's what modeling chocolate we now know it's the only way I could describe it there are many ways to make modeling chocolate and fondant shiny brushing it with cooking spray is one of the easiest so I'll do one more drip on here and you get this a more of this brown we're in Lemongrab not looking chocolate not sure where that got you okay so in the meantime what I have to do to finish up my stack of pancakes is make some blueberries after all these are blueberry pancakes so to make my blueberries have some dark navy color fondant and I added a little bit of tylose powder to this just to stiffen it up to get this color I mixed together black purple and some navy blue and to turn them into blueberries there's a turn the spine in the blueberries basically I'm just going to knead it until it's nice and soft and then roll it it will fall in my hands to get rid of any of the scenes set the time for just deciding I'm going to grab a little star cutter just to add like a little 5-point indentation to the top and then I'll grab my little ball tool and I'm going to press it into the center and then kind of pull it out up in a few spots and then pinch it back together I think that looks pretty pretty blueberry like alright so I'll show you guys that again taking a little bit of this navy blue or blue berry colored fondant rolling into a nice smooth ball hit it with a little Equinix star just to make it look like a little you know where they came off the stem and then rough it off just a little bit with my ball tool place that right there alright so let's add one more of the syrup turkic-speaking i think these are really soft stuff to make my syrup colored modeling-chocolate super-easy a little bit of golden yellow a touch of copper and then some Brown gives you this awesome set up color so a lot of times I've seen pancake cakes where people use actual syrup that's cool but I think it's a little too like thin and seeker I really like how this how the modeling chocolate looks that's why I decide to go with Molly chocolate writing so a pull top nice and thin so that I can blend it into my top syrup piece right here wait all right so to finish up my little lass a little syrup pour here that's when I add a little handle so really simple I'm just going to take a little piece of white fondant flatten it down a little bit get some cornstarch to show that it's not sticky and this case is about to come together if you guys are just joining you're seeing the final crowning jewelry the final few moments of this huge stack of blueberry pancakes come together so make a little handle just going to see if this works perfect cut a little strip of white modeling chocolate it's a little bit thinner and I'm going to attach this to my setup Cup at the top of my cake so to do that wet that just a little bit hopefully it sticks truly hot in here so we'll see so I'll pull one end in and then pull out of there and in takes me back to my days in the ceramic studio cool pretty simple there I don't want to fidget with this too much because it's really kind of hot but there you go little handle it so now I want to make this shine I want this there to really glisten like real syrup right so I like to just take a regular old cooking spray spray some of it into the cap grab a paintbrush I should start so organized and I'll tell you once I start working everything is just crazy alright so just by brushing some vegetable oil just on to this therap it gets really shiny I what I'm doing this I like to be really careful because obviously don't want the pancakes to be shiny I only want the CEREC to be shiny so just brush it on and this usually lasts for quite a while but oil isn't really going to absorb into the modeling chocolate too much but if it's data I would just you know we brush it before before the celebration but this cake isn't for a party both of these pancake cakes or are just for me so lucky you lucky me right so I'm just brushing this here for the special oil to get nice and shiny nice and set up like get this little guy right here in the back so I think the best part about this cake is that well number one it's it's so huge and then it looks like a huge stack of blueberry pancakes but it actually is a blueberry cake on the inside so you should really can't get cake for breakfast drink I cake for breakfast sometimes anyway so okay alright so let's finish this up I have some big ol Pat's of butter here super easy all I did was take some really like yellow modeling chocolate and come into squares and just round the edges just a little bit so let's see where's my front this is microphone X that's a big Pat's of butter and I'll start with some blueberries so whenever you're placing stuff on a cake it's good to kind of place it in late groups of three because things look good in groups of three so three or five or you know maybe even one would be good so you know put one down here in the front another one right there so really quickly I'll show you guys one more time how you eat blueberries a little bit of my navy color fondant give a little need so it's nice and soft so I can roll it into a circle I'll roll it into a little sphere I'm gonna set a square different a square take a little five-pointed star cutter giving the look of the top stem part of the blueberry and then I'll pinch it back together just a little bit there we go put that one on side and I'll put a few more on the top why not there you go so that's how I like to make a huge cake that looks like a stack of blueberry pancakes I'm going to cut into this I'll show you guys exactly what it looks like on the inside I also have one I'm not going to cut into let me grab a nice sharp knife and a plate and a little paper towel because of any final questions leave your questions in the comments below don't forget to check out my facebook at baked by dan check me out on instagram at baked by Santana share this video if you have anyone you think would you know what's the I'll comes to the background right where the seams are so straight down with my knife oh yeah I always like to clean my knife in between cuts makes a much nicer cake slice all right see how I did here oh that's good it's just a lot of cake so the lemons marry cake looks like Moses we're very sent to the bottom but there you go that is the inside of the blueberry pancake cake it's pretty sweet deal this piece is all for me I'll try and come for it guys don't forget to follow me on Facebook and Instagram if you have a cool idea for a sculpted cake or any kind of cool cake projects let me know in the comments below do you guys have any questions you can hit me up on Facebook at bayside in or leave your questions in the comments below I hope you guys enjoyed watching this guys have an awesome week I'll see you all soon thanks
what's up guys how's it going welcome back to my bait shop I'm Dan laying in tonight or today rather it's all about tape for breakfast because I'm creating a gigantic fried egg I don't know the other than can't afford because that's what I do around you so this giant fried egg starts with a big forty inch layer of butter cake and a little six inch layer butter cake so this little 6 inch gave income to joke so I actually died the a butter cake yellow apart basics I'm gonna cut through the whole thing it's yellow egg yolk so the first thing I have to do is carve down my yolk so you can see here I just started with a six inch round layer cake and I already started rounding off the sides just around a little bit I always spend a lot of time looking at the food I'm going to create before I before I actually you know create it and I eat eggs every day when I was younger I always used to eat fried eggs we call them dippy eggs but I know most people probably call them sunny-side up eggs we're good so guys don't forget to leave your comments below I'm curious to know your favorite way to eat an egg and I don't know if our questions are showing up so if you have any questions I'll do my best to answer any of them whichever ones I can after this broadcast but share this video with someone you think might enjoy it and let us know below if there are any realistic food cakes you would like to see me create here live on the Food Network Facebook page so what I'm doing right now is just frosting my six inch cake with some yellow American buttercream and I'm going to put some yellow fondant over it and I'm using all yellow here obviously so that when I cut into it it's yellow like a yolk so my cake for this or this yoke cake here's nice and cold and I find that sometimes when I spread American buttercream over a cake that's been carved all of the fresh crumb kind of makes a little hard to spread the buttercream so a good tip that I have is to microwave your buttercream just for about five or ten seconds depending on how much you have just so that it's a little bit thinner because as soon as it hits the cold it's going to kind of you know stiffen up so if you get it a little bit warm before you spread it on the cake it'll be a little easier to spread and another really cool thing about this cake is that since it's such a I guess shortcake since it's so rounded and organic it's not really you know take with any sharp edges I can actually make this cake from start to finish without children so normally I'm all about showing my cakes if you guys have seen me work before you know that but this one I can kind of make from start to finish so this is just a piece of plastic acetate and it's great for kind of contouring buttercream cakes or ganache cakes just like I'm doing right here because you can bend it in your hands kind of shape your cake so I just want to frost this fairly smooth now looks pretty good so I'm going to set this aside and I'm going to roll out a little bit of yellow fondant so if you guys are just joining this gigantic fried egg is actually a cake it's a 14 inch cake with a six inch cake on top this is a egg yolk I'm creating it live right now with the help of some vanilla butter cake some butter creams of course and fondant so I just frosted my yolk and now I'm meeting together some yellow fondant that I dyed with some golden yellow gel paste and just a touch of orange because I want the seal to be really really rich in color so just a little bit of cornstarch on my bench here I'll flatten it out just a touch and I'll roll this in a nice circle I always like to turn right on it as a rolling it just so stays in a circle and also because it stays nice and even and thickness that way so if you guys have never checked out my facebook page report the link to my facebook page baked by Dan is at the top of this video make sure you check it out and if you want to see some of the recipes I use for my cake or buttercream or anything like that I don't over my blog which is baking with Dan comm and also checking out an Instagram because every week when I do these lives I try and post progress photos for leaked stories of what's going on so you can know before I go live what I'm going to create we move my cornstarch here so my cake should be nice and sticky because I just put the buttercream on it so I'm just going to lay this on it right over top just use my hand to smooth the top down I want to try and keep this nice rounded Yoshi so I'll just turn this as I smooth down sees the rounded part of my hands and right now this is pretty matte but what I'm actually going to do is paint this with some vegetable oil once the whole thing is together and it's going to give my fondant yoke that really nice glistening appearance that our freshly fried egg would have so stay tuned because there are a lot of really cool techniques that I'm going to use to finish this cake off they're really going to bring it to life so another really a fun thing about this process is that normally when I'm rolling out fondant always working to get rid of any air bubbles that are in the fondant but as I was making my example cake earlier I realized that fried eggs are full of bubbles so I really didn't even have to worry about popping all those bubbles so this is just a wooden sculpting tool I'll use it all the time for cakes and since it's smaller than my finger I can use it to kind of push the fondant all the way into the bottom corner of that cake and then what I'm going to do is grab a knife grab a craft knife here and then I'm just going to cut the fondant away barely touching or that cake is and I'll just talk a little bit of that under and then I'm just going to set this aside so if you guys have any questions don't forget you can post them below I'll do my best to transfer them after this broadcast if you're looking for awesome recipes that are going to turn out bakery style treats in your home kitchen make sure you check out my blog which is baking with Dan comm and if you guys are working on any cakes or you've attempted any sculpted cakes or sculpted food cakes please share them in the comments below because one of my favorite parts about this whole gig here is getting to see what you guys create so feel free to share away awesome so that's when I can finish them inside what I want to do here really quickly just to round this out just little bit further take some of my fondant just an extra scrap piece here knead it together until all the wrinkles go away I'm going to use this to buff my yoke out I'll get a nice smooth side there and just really lightly I'd imagine the support would be like to put makeup on I don't really know I don't know if anyone's ever tried to use a piece of fondant to make a vodka then be really funny you should share about it have you ever tried that gate you think that would work no Beautyblender maybe at work maybe you could blend your beautiful makeup with a piece of fondant alright so see that just kind of buffs the whole thing out makes it look nice and soft gets rid of any like rough finger marks awesome so this I'm just going to set aside and I'm going to get to work in on the weight of my case now my cake is going to start with just white fondant but as you'll see in the cake that I've already completed there's a lot of color and texture that goes into it and that all comes from using a propane torch once the whole cake is put together so what I have here I want to work on a piece of parchment so it's easy to clean up I have a 14 inch cake it's about an inch thick I have it on a 12 inch board so I have a little bit of overhang so that when I shape my cake you won't see the board won't ever be exposed so the first thing I want to do is just kind of cover two sides in this way just to make it kind of a in uneven circle so it's a little more than organic looking or you know like natural as a fried egg would be and then basically I just want to taper in all of the sides so I'm just going to turn this as I work here so this cake itself actually started with three pounds of vanilla buttermilk cake which I call my confetti cake on my blog because I usually like to put rainbow sprinkles in it but if you just want a nice solid buttermilk cake you can forego the sprinkles and you'll have a really great butter base cake cards well and stacks well also goes just an interest of keeping my space clean I'm trying to keep all these chromosomes parchment and then I'll just drop this with some buttercream and I know from earlier that we stopped doing a crumb coat this is going to look a little rough but like I said Friday totally organic bumpy all kinds of Ripley and you know rough looking from from being fried um so by no means am I too worried about this beam you know really smooth like I normally would be when I'm putting on this cake which is really cool because it makes this process a whole lot quicker so I know that eggs are one of my favorite breakfast foods and they've been ever since I was younger we call fried eggs dippy eggs and I was a little kid if you guys have a favorite way to eat an egg or you have a cool idea for an egg cake let us know in the comments below because I think Arius the same what's your favorite way to eat an egg key yeah dippy eggs yeah I don't hope anyone else fulfilling everything so you can call it funny side up you can call a fried egg and silly call it dippy egg which actually sounds really funny two more in say so and have it this is nice and tapered in I want to leave this out fairly flat because that's where I'll attach the yolk and whatever I'm carving a cake I like to do it in really short motions I just take off one section at a time you can always take off more but if I did accidentally take a big dent out of my cake it wouldn't be a big deal back filled with buttercream so frosting a cake is more like being a only go for meant work early go consult their sculptor well I mean you know when you're when you're frosting a cake it's almost like you're out now working with like bread and a there's nothing on my cake artists come on alright so this looks pretty organic it will take even more shape once once the pilot is on there so let me just clean up my space a little bit you guys are just joining this gigantic fried egg cake it's 14 inches across made with three pounds of cake and creating it right now out of cake buttercream is fun so don't go anywhere because we're going to come together to mess up the next few minutes so I'm going to move my cake up onto my turntable here this particular Topher do you guys have any questions about fate being about you know sculpting cakes or whatever let me know in the comments below I'll do my best to answer once this broadcast is over can also feel free to hit me up on my Facebook page or think right and check me out on Facebook of a potential me on Instagram alright let's give this a frog so I have some butter cream here at piping bag just an easy way to kind of distribute this and I just need a thin layer here doesn't have to be really pissed with all these crumbs I like to try and keep the spatula going in one motion and just keep a spatula on the buttercream because if the bear spatula touches the cake or I pulled a spatula up to complete its just going to kind of rip those crumbs away which is no big deal because all of this will be covered once the cake is out you know covered in the white fondant so I think my favorite part of putting this cake together is getting to torch the edges with the propane torch anytime I can bring out my propane torch and fire that up when I'm working on a cake it's always toys extra fun it's a chance to be a little a little dangerous and live on the edge a little bit you don't get to live on the edge too much when you're making cakes but when you're torching a cake that might be as crazy to catch so across this all the way to the edges I'm going to tuck the fondant under the edges of this cake so I'm not too concerned with getting the buttercream all the way to the very edges because the butter critter the fun is going to stick to the case anyway smooth this all out awesome so I'll take a little poll scraper here and just smooth this just a tiny bit so connecting perfect again like I said but I don't want any huge lines in my buttercream so this is just a big bowl scraper it's just going to get rid of any really rough lines they're good so I'll set this aside and now what I have to do is grab a sheet and I'm gonna put the tollgate together this giant egg cake I'll put it together on a sheet pan because when you're making an egg bake need a big platter for them and the biggest thing I have is this sheet pan so I have a clean sheet pan turned upside down and since it's metal this is also going to allow me to torch the edges of a without letting me do a fire so now I've got to roll out some white fondant so before I do that I want to clean up any final crumb before I get my weight fondant all right grab my white final step before I put my wife on their own is to actually add my yoke before I add the white on it what that's going to do is cover the bottom edge of the yoke the white will be a fondant that's the egg white of the Cape will actually cover the bottom seam of the yoke so they yolk and the white will look more like they're one piece as opposed to just being stuck on top now I'll try my white on it get a little bit of shortening in my hand so it's nice and easy to need and I'll give it a good knead until it's nice and stretchy so what this is nice and stretchy and we'll pull it out and I'll draped it all over the cakes and I'm just going to cut away the portion that's covering and oak and smooth the entire thing together all right I'm going to bring all these wrinkles to the bottom decided nice smooth top and I'll roll it out look at a cornstarch on my bench if you guys are just joining here my name is Dan Landon I'm from baked by Dan I love making hammock realistic food cakes one my favorite things to put together and tonight I'm making this huge fried egg because eggs are my favorite breakfast student I thought it'd be really fun to turn a fried egg into a cake so I see a few air bubbles normally I'd be really dead-set on popping them but I'm not worried about because the white of the Friday always has air bubbles so we'll just add to the look of the whole thing I do want to try and keep this in barely even circle just so I know that go covers my whole cake so I'll keep turning it as I roll it tuna rolls and I should good to go so normally I'm always working with chilled cakes because chilled cakes are a lot easier to sculpt and cover with fondant but I'm just going to cover this straightaway I obviously haven't chilled butter cream but since it's such a rounded design and really organic to begin with it so it doesn't need to be chilled so just kind of roll this up move my Center my table unroll this fondant on top of the whole thing first thing I want to do is just smooth down around that yolk because in just a moment I'm gonna basically just cut away the fondant right where the yolk is touching the white and I'll just peel this extra way and that yolk will be revealed there so by putting the white over the yolk and then peeling it off it makes the egg look a little more seamless like they're actually one piece instead of you know just like the yolk looking like I just plopped it on top of the white so around the edges here what I want to do is just kind of flatten this down so it looks a little more pointed towards the ends good all right I got my craft knife again grab my sculpting tool and I'm just going to trace around the yolk just to get myself a line of wearing it to cut so what I'm trying to do this right up against the edge of the yoke and if there's any space like if any cake shows through totally no big deal I'll just push the white fondant into into the yolk and it will just look like one seamless stain so really carefully I want to peel this up good so I'll just push these two pieces together put my white away here all right and so on this edge here what I'm going to do is cut that quarter of an inch away from the side of the key because I want to spin this edge a little bit and texture it so it looks nice and rough and that's the part that I'm going to hit with my propane torch it's really brown and make it look like it's actually you know fresh out of the frying pan peel this away take a little bit of my white use it to push that fondant towards the yoke and if any buttercream Peaks out I'm just going to brush it away with the pastry brush alright so now it's really just on the texturing and coloring and that's what absolutely brings the paint to life so this is my favorite I'm going to move this up on top of my turntable all right I'm gonna grab a pastry brush get rid of any buttercream or a little cake crumbs that have kind of poked through the whole thing and I'm going to take two texturing tools and the first thing I'm going to do is just smooth out this cut edge so it looks a little softer and a little West Point so the smooth is hoping down I want the white to look thin but I still want it to be a good bit of cake so this cake believe it or not like I said it's about three pounds of cake so it really put served at least about 10 people you got a good inch of cake here so what I'm going to do is just start kind of rough from the edges up a little bit adding some little texture holes making this look like you know I just dropped this egg into a skillet of hot oil that white started to cook up right away so just some holes in some spots that the propane torch is really going to accentuate maybe some larger ones and other spots kind of break it this is one of the best parts of making food cakes is when you get to really come be creative and random and texture things and add color and add you know dimension with your with your texture and airbrushing and dusting makes the whole process really fun so now I'll just add some air bubbles or little little pricks around where the UH where the white video could be together I want to add some more texture I can just use my fingers right so once this cake is finished I'm going to hit it with some pepper because I always eat my fried eggs with fresh dirt freshly cracked black pepper it's like one of my favorite things and crush up black sprinkle actually work really well for that the first I thought about using black sugar but the crushed up black sprinkles really look like fresh cracked pepper because you get a really irregular shape and size of all themselves it's all about those sprinkles can do a lot of them alright so if any parts look like too rounded and don't look flat and off ball just kind of push them out just a little bit more push some areas in just a perfect circle awesome alright so super painful all right so I'm going to start this and then I'm going to paint the case it's a little shiny and then I'll hit it with just a little more color so I'm just going to keep my propane torch moving as I aim aflame right towards the side of - I'll let some areas get a little bit darker so this is just a little creme brulee torch I just borrowed from the kitchen store and all its really doing it caramelized in the sugar we're burning all the sugar and the fondant basically take this all the way around edges and then I'm actually going to use some watered-down piping gel to paint over the yolk to give it kinda like a semi-gloss finish and then to give the yolk a really high gloss finish I'm going to use some vegetable cooking spray vegetable oil don't want some little spots need where that oil jumped up and hit the egg I'll just hit a few spots on top not too dark so just a little bit all right so now I'm going to grab some piping gel written down with just a little bit of water just a little bit easier to paint on my white and I'll just paint this whole thing on here and I'm just really going to bring the white to life just so it looks nice and freshly cooked and ready to eat I'll paint it all the way up to the yolk if some of it gets on the yolk though chilly no big deal doesn't matter so make sure I have a nice even covering so I'll just spin my cake as I bring the brush up the side of the cake alright I'm gonna grab some cooking spray and I'm just going to spray the cooking spray directly on top of the yolk and then I'll use another pastry brush just to kind of paint the whole thing to make it look nice and smooth so just spraying this vegetable cooking spray on top of the yolk and I'll just paint across the whole thing and then after a second or two any bubbles or brush marks will go away and look like a nice freshly cooked and give now I think this needs a bit more color so I'm just going to torch the side of this a little bit more I like when my Friday has a lot of color on the edges because I think it has a really nice toasted nutty flavor let's get some good color here so whenever you're torching fondant you always want to keep the torch moving because it'll look like it's not doing anything and then all the sudden is going to bubble and color is going to show up so this is easier to do in codes if you're looking for a really deep color instead of trying to do it really dark all in one shot and it's going to smoke a little bit too because you're burning the sugar in the fondant but that's no big deal actually smelled like tar piston marshmallows so I'm not complaining all right a little bit more right here and then when I hit this with some black pepper I can eat a fried egg without some freshly cracked pepper on top so I have some black sprinkle that I just kind of crushed up and I'll crush them up just a little bit more as I sprinkle them on top of the egg and I think it looks like freshly cracked pepper right across the center there we go so I'm ready to eat it's not even breakfast time but right now I have cake for breakfast this is my gigantic fried egg if you guys just joined and

what is up guys happy Friday I'm Dan Lang and I'm here to show you guys a really awesome sculpted cake project so when fronting I have this huge half sheet cake and it's been really warm and sunny here in Pennsylvania so I've totally been feeling the summer vibes lately so I figured I'm just going to skip spring entirely and I wanted to make a ice cream cake so a huge sculpted ice cream popsicle pop possible ice cream whatever you want to call it so you guys will see right here I have a huge half sheet cake let's check this cheap cake out I have a huge half sheet cake did I uh filled in France with buttercream it all I did was round off the edges with you know a knife gave the entire thing a nice buttercream coat with the help of my bowl scraper right here and whenever I'm eating an ice cream pop or popsicle there's always a huge bite at it because I don't mess around it comes to ice cream so I want to make a big bite out of this ice cream so what I'm doing here is taking a 7 inch pastry ring my cake is nice and cold so this is cutting super easily before I cut this let me just pop some gloves on this project is so much fun to put together this big ice cream pop is one of my favorite cakes and last week we made a huge lemon slice and a lot of people actually made the cake and shared it which was really cool to see so if you guys make this cake screaming you know attempt it definitely share it let me know so I'm just going to clean these crumbs up a little bit and I have some buttercream and what I'm going to do is just give this like a little crumb coat it doesn't need to be super stick with icing or anything because we're just going to cover it in fondant so I have some buttercream here this is just Swiss buttercream it's nice and soft and I'll just give this little crumb coat just my fondant sticks so if you guys are into all of this cake design and like cool custom cakes and sculpted cakes and stuff definitely check out my Facebook page which we have linked to at the top of this video it's baked by Dan on Facebook and if you do Instagram check me out on instagram at baked by Dan so hopefully we got some questions rolling in I love answering your baking and pastry questions or cake baking questions so if you guys have a question leave your question in the comments below and I don't forget to share this post with any of your friends you think would enjoy it cool so just a really quick little buttercream coat like that grab my little paper towels get rid of these crumbs so now I have to roll out some fondant right so tonight I'm using marshmallow fondant and it's just a recipe that I make if you've never worked with marshmallow fondant before you definitely should check it out because it's super easy to work with you can use search online for marshmallow fondant recipes you'll definitely find plenty of recipes you could try out so I'll just move my cake right over here and I will grab oh so this is about five pounds of fun it looks like a lot of fondant and it certainly is but whenever you're covering a cake and fun you always want extra fondant because you want the fondant to be able to drink really easily order the cake because it makes smoothing the fun and a lot easier so I'm going to grab just a little bit of vegetable shortening through my hands here and I want to knead this stuff until it's really soft until it's almost like saltwater taffy because I want it to be nice and stretchy so that it's flexible when I drape it over my cake so if you guys have any funding questions if you with those questions below see if we can answer them so if you guys are just joining we are totally feeling the summer vibes tonight oh it's beautiful warm weather we've been having in Pennsylvania least and we are creating a huge sculpted ice cream popsicle cake I was kind of going back and forth but I call this a popsicle shy called an ice cream but I'm all about rich desserts so I definitely choose ice cream over a popsicle but to each is alright alright so this is pretty flexible now so gosh you gotta work on them out of breath here he's doing this so what I'm going to do is gather all of my rough corners to the underside get a nice smooth top that'll be the top I'll roll out so I will grab my shaker filled with cornstarch you could use cornstarch here you could use powdered sugar or confectioners sugar icing sugar people call it different things but I like powder I mean I like cornstarch it's what I've always used works well for me so before I even ground my rolling pin I'm just going to start flattening this a bit put a little bit of cornstarch on top grab my trusty PVC pipe start giving us a rope so I always like to roll from the middle out make sure it's nice and even I'm going for about an eighth of an inch thick here pick it up I'll turn it around turning your fondant often make sure that the fondants not sticking to the table and it also ensures that the fun it is a nice even thickness which is important you know whenever you're making a sculpted cake turn this again so I know that I need my fun it should be about as long and as wide as a rolling pin so I'm going to just roll this fondant totes as wide as my table so if you guys are just tuning in we are rolling out some fondant right now to cover an awesome ice cream sculpted cake er let's complicate that is an ice cream popsicle the cake itself isn't made of ice cream though you guys get the picture if you guys like your scene here if you feel so inclined check out my facebook page of Bayside and check out on Instagram I always post cool stories I was working on some really cool French macarons today so I was putting that in my internet story all right so this is got a little too big to turn around so what I'll do is just shift it around with my hands just make sure it's not sticking which it's not and I'll grab a pin here you guys can see that I have a couple of air bubbles no big deal at all just pop those and smooth it out my finger have one right over here too sometimes the air bubbles in your font especially especially the ones on the end don't even end up on your cake but it's always easier to pop the air bubble when the fun is on the table then to try and wait so you know - okay so what I'm doing now is just kind of buffing this on it smoothing out I'm just holding the rolling pin still I'm just getting it as one final stretch this is just going to get rid of any like digits in the font from the rolling pin we have any questions someone wants to know what your Facebook is again ready so my plan yeah baked by Jan's you guys just look at the video description above you'll see a little link you can click on that those baked by Dan you can check me out there or if you're looking for my Instagram it's just baked by down on Instagram or you can search the damn Langan on Instagram that's me alright so I have my fondant smoother here just give them this fun in the nice buff get into this something wants to know if March now and fondant will hold up better in a high humidity climate that really depends on the recipe really depends on the recipe and how humid the climate is so you guys will see here like Hawaii like Hawaii you know I've never been Hawaii I would love to be if you want to invite me to Hawaii probably say yes but um honestly with with a lot of things like a lot of things and baking and cake decorating I would say experiment if you're making marshmallow fondant and you know you're in a high human climate or a climates ranking it I would leave some of the water out so check out a marshmallow find recipe leave some of the water out of it and probably work well for it so I roll my fondant up on a rolling pin so let's check this out right here so starting with the fondant just hanging out just the very edge of the cake roll the silver my cake stretch it down the sides the first thing I want to do is push in the fondant right around this little cutout right here and we're going to cover this in some melted chocolate on top so I'm not super worried about these little cracks right here but whenever you have it in doubt like this you want to work on that first because kind of a funny shape so you want to make sure you push that in and then the next thing I'll do is grab my corners so to smooth the corner down I'm just going to bend my hand and like a 90 degree angle fashion and just smooth that in flip this around we'll do the same thing right here stretch it out to slightly been been in and I will just use the soft edge of my hand to push this down towards the side of the board and it's a little humid here today so I could tell that my buttercream was already sticky but if my buttercream didn't look kind of sticky from my cake being cold and it being brought out into you know humid weather I would have just sprayed my buttercream with a little bit of water or vodka which is my favorite thing if you guys could see me decorate cakes fourth you'll know that vodka is always like my go-to liquid for attaching something to a cake awesome that was pretty I love them stuff it's easy alright so you grab my fondant smoother I'll just smooth out the top of this it's already looking so good so if you guys are curious this layered half sheet cake is probably cake for about 45 people which is a heck of a lot of cake so I'll tell you I have a lot of cake to eat when there's live broadcast is over all right so what I'm doing here is just taking my phone it's bitter I've got the rounded edge down and I'm just smoothing the side of the cake this helps to attach the fondant right to the bottom of the cake or right at that bottom corner do that again this way by the way in the back and then I'll just use my fingers just to push that in right there alright so I'll cut away most of this excess just to make the board a little lighter just using a paring knife for this if you guys are just joining you don't forget to share this post leave a comment let us know what you think if you guys have ever created a spoke to cake before I love to see other people's work so share that picture below and I by all means if you attempt this cake somewhere over the weekend or later tonight I don't know whatever works for you certainly share it on my Facebook page at a Friday know and love to see it so now I'm just taking a sculpting tool and I'm going to start pushing this fondant under the cake this is really important because a real popsicle is rounded on the bottom just like it is on the top so this wouldn't just sit completely flat on the board it would round under so the way to do that is just by pushing the fondant under the cake using some type of sculpting tool could even use a spoon like a metal spoon backwards or I guess you would say backwards right like a spoon flipped over and just use the rounded part of the spoon to do the same thing right here then can you explain we have a few questions from various people about using vodka to make fondant stick to cakes I was sure yeah really simple so guys fondant is mostly sugar and sugar dissolved in water alright so whenever you use water to attach foam into a case or it to attach fondant to itself you have to be really careful because if you go overboard the fondant just has the tendency to get really sticky and kind of get kind of gooey and slosh around that's what water but vodka is alcohol so it doesn't dissolve the sugar as easily or as quickly and it also evaporates really quickly so I like to use vodka simply because it dries so quickly it makes the fondant stick to the cake and it's not really going to cause any like gooey fondant or like debating of your colors you really could use any clear alcohol you know whenever I guess you could use tequila you could use clear rum that's the thing right mm-hmm wait round white rum I have even used when I've run out of back you guys I've even used like an orange the tool that you would use for making like a margarita so I'm just using this sculpting tool just to hit the microphone with my head there I'm just using the tilting tool to now cut the fondant off so it's like a multi-purpose tool first you tuck the fondant under the cake and then you use the tool to tape extra fondant off and I like to do this in pieces instead of doing like one really long strip I think it's a bit easier to cut off just what you need because I don't want to cut too much off here I definitely want to tuck it under because I don't want to see the cake especially since this is a red velvet that you guys may have seen awesome so now you can see that I have like a little rounded edge here the fun it's nicely tucked under actually how I did that we have this point in edge here I just take the tool just pushed upon it in and then glide the tool on it super easy just finish up this little higher cut mark right here so this is a pretty giant cake like I said this is cake for like gosh 45 people I thought about making this cake so long but I figured this is Facebook live the KFC's huge recipe big easiest way to make a really impressive cake I think it's just makes huge that's all you have to do it just makes you so I figured let's make a huge ice cream obstacle but if you wanted to make a quarter sheet cake if you wanted to you know attempt this and make it much smaller so we could do that you are the boss in your own kitchen do whatever you want all right so that looks pretty good I'm happy with how that looks right so I'll just go around one more time of my fondant smoother just smooth the top and the edges kind of at the same time if my fondant was kind of sticky and my fondant smoother for sticking to the fondant a little bit all I have to do is put a little cornstarch on the up on it and if you know big jokes I'm just going to steam this cake anyway so that cornstarch would have disappeared all right so let me just put my fondant back we always want to keep your fondant scraps bag right because all right so now what I'm going to do is apply a little bit of vegetable shortening just to the top portion of the cake because I'm going to roll out some Brown chocolate fondant and attach it to the top of the cake and then cut it away so that it looks like really luscious strips of really rich hot fudge sauce or something like that so I'm using vegetable shortening to attach the brown fondant because I want to drape a big thing of brown fondant over this and then peel it away so the vegetable shortening allows me to attach the fondant but it's kind of just like a semi-permanent attachment it's not going to be impossible to pull away right so if I use water to attach the brown to the green it would totally check it out in every loss so I'm just going to move this get my work face back you have a question Bethany would like to know if you weren't going to be covering the top of your cake how can you fix crack in your fondant um could I question that well the first thing you can do is start with fondant it's really soft so you can microwave your microwave your fondant and then knead it for probably like five minutes I need to mind pretty quickly you can also take your phone and smoothers and kind of like push those cracks together and kind of like massage them together and you can also grow some shortening over it but um yeah everyone has a different methods that they like you could use a little bit of royal icing that was colored the same colors on it and use that to kinda like catch the I found that off you just kinda have to experiment I think and find what works you know best for you but I think the best advice I could give to that question is to try and be really diligent with your fondant meeting so it doesn't crack first place and if you find that your fondant is constantly cracking try different recipe or try adding a brand upon it so is the brown fondant right here ash is pretty stiff so a little shortening on my head let's give us a nice neat I want to knit and stretchy so I'm a total chocoholic when it comes to desserts and sweets if it's got chocolate in it on there so that's why I decided to go for chocolate here but it's good totally be any any colors on there any flavor you would want it to be if you guys have a suggestion or a cake that you would like to see create on Facebook live hit me in the comments below let me know what you think always looking for fresh creative ideas someone said this could have been an orange creamsicle so hop to go hey cook but I sure I'd go with a mint green and like I said chocolate because chocolates like my favorite food group alright so see how this is nice and stretchy is pulling really well and not really breaking this chocolate fondant does have actual chocolate in so the texture of it is a little bit different this is kind of like a mixture of chocolate modeling chocolate and fondant so a little bit tougher if you were trying this you could just use plain vanilla fondant it's dyed brown but where's then it's all about chocolate with me so alright so I'm meeting all the edges together the corner so you have a nice smooth top and I see I'm gonna measure my cake here 11:6 so you might find it about 17 inches wide right and then it would be just as long as it turns out okay on top so I'll start rolling this sideways to get the width of the network this reminds me of the gigantic chocolate-covered strawberry cake that we need for Valentine's Day which is like one of my all-time favorite cakes you guys didn't see that video check out my facebook page because it's there it's really awesome be a great cake for any of the remotes actually but we covered the bottom of that cake with some Brown fondant this was a chocolate-covered strawberry shortcake so we feel on that chocolate covered vibe right now all right so everyone usually asks me why I use a PVC pipe and the answer is just because I like to and I kind of always had let out know the real answer is because they're PVC pipes are really easy to find I got this at the hardware store for like 3 bucks and super easy to clean so PVC for rolling out fondant always a good a good deal I find it fun it doesn't stick to it as much either just because it's a shiny plastic surface so I'm just popping any air bubbles I see my fondant with a pin a little thinner on this times like this one totally wish I had a shooter all right so roll from the center out right now check my thickness here in a little bit [Music] so if you guys are just joining I've already covered my huge ice cream popsicle with a nice mint green fondant and now I'm rolling out some chocolate fondant I'm going to drape over the top going to come my chocolate dip it shopping trip that's pretty good I'm happy with that oh all right so same deal I will roll this up grab my cake and I only want this on the top half of my cake right here so if you guys just thaw just you're tuning in and just use a little bit of vegetable shortening on the top push on cake that's going to make this fondant stick slightly easier to sing how then did you make this piece with hot on it yeah yeah I'd say it's about it's like 1/8 of an inch thick probably all rights the same deal start with my corners start with the top edge this top little cut this extra off got a little say it with all the chocolate there and little to my channel alright so I'll push in this indentation this is the bite mark because if there is an ice cream popsicle and myself in the same room gonna be at least one bite mark out of it so I'll push that in there smooth these sides down this chocolate fondant is awesome it actually smells like chocolate I don't know if you can solve it I can smell it you can phone I don't you guys can smell it but also rich and chocolatey that is all the notes of chocolate so that one on really easily I'm going to grab my sonic smoother smooth that down the sides there kind of push that edge in smooth this around and usually when I'm covering a cake in fondant I want the edges to be nice and sharp sharp corners and all that good stuff out in the night scream pops cooling you know it doesn't have sharp corners all rounded and rushes and just dipped in rich chocolate sauce perfect it is so grabbing my sculpting tool one more time I'll do that same deal I just did I'm just pushing the fondant under the cake and then I'll go back and I'll use the tool which is a bit more pressure to actually cut the fondant off so if you guys have any questions about sculpting cakes or about baking cakes if you have any issues or things you know you need some guidance on when it comes to baking let us know leave your question the comments we'll see if we can answer it alright so cutting this away and in just a moment I'm going to use a sharp craft knife and do some more cutting here so that it looks like there are just big drips of this chocolate and not just one on solid piece so if you guys want notifications for when I'm going to be doing these on live broadcast make sure to check out my facebook page which is baked by Dan you can find the link for it in the top of the video here you can add me on there also check me out on instagram at bake by dan i also have a youtube channel that's baking with dan though they don't get a little confusing there so lightly different slightly so I'm going to grab a sharp craft knife and what I'm going to do is just cut through this chocolate fondue and just cut some drips of chocolate here and what I'll be able to do is pull this extra fondant away because I only used vegetable shortening to attach it if I'd used water fun it would be stuck there until I don't know like next week forever basically someone wants to know that the pre-press that you did for this cake how long does it take sure um you guys will see really quick obviously the shortening didn't go all the way down to where these pieces are so if any extra pieces aren't sticking all I have to do is that a little more shortening will stick in place so how long does this cake take so I baked these two half sheets yesterday when I was baking I was doing my bakes for the weekend and after they cooled I filled them with some mascarpone buttercream and then I just let the cake chiller tonight so I'd say this is like a two day project so you would bake until your cake one day and then let it sit in the fridge overnight or for you know two days if you needed to and then you can decorate the cake in one day so I'll just start back at the other side here do a shorter one yeah guys sometimes people think that you know you have to like finish a cake in one day but often with a lot of sculpted cakes especially be really really complicated really detailed ones there like day long or like week long projects so you just keep your take chilled in the refrigerator as long as it is crumb coated you shouldn't have to worry about it drying out because all the fat and the buttercream or the ganache whatever it is keeps your cake nice and it's an airtight alright so I really like this apply and then cut away method I think it's a lot easier to drape that chocolate fondant over the cake and then cut the fondant off as opposed to trying to cut out this really intricate shape in and lay it in place I think that becomes a little more difficult alright so anywhere that didn't get any shortening to make these stick I'll just apply a little bit shortening I'll kind of stretch those out and if any of these edges look like really sharp or really cut I'll just run my finger over them so they look a little a little softer a more natural so if you guys are just joining I still have two really awesome pieces left to go on this cake simply I want to hang in there for I don't know another ten minutes maybe to see this come together any sharp edges you can just take a craftool or sculpting knife and just tuck those under one more piece right here all right so really quickly before I forget if this was a real ice cream pop you would not have the bike dipped right I don't think you bite your ice cream pops on and dip them in chocolate right so I'm going to cut away just this outline where the bite is so we can see the green let's fill that back and you'll see how easily that comes off like I said thanks to the thanks to the shortening being on there so now what I want to do is just add a little strip of brown fondant to the bottom just to kind of act like a border so I'll just use this extra piece I just cut off just cut a thin strip with the help of my trusty paring knife and I'll just push that in place there also make use of my sculpting tool again percent please any of this shortening I can just kind of buff out get rid of it just smoothies sharp edges in with my fingers oh yeah if I were to take a flight out of an ice-cream obstacle it probably would be this big so this is pretty accurate so card thing all right so I'm going to turn on my steamer I want to steam this nice and shiny so all the cornstarch disappears this is tool that way if someone when the homemaker didn't have a steamer what could they do in order to steam a cake like that you can carefully use your iron with the steam setting this whole by iron straight up and then use the steam button if your iron has one of those functions I think that's probably the best bet but you should always try to be pretty limited with the amount of cornstarch or whatever your you are using because you need to go overboard sometimes you can't take her a bit with the steamer always so you have to be careful so before i steam this cake I'm going to give it one more go round and make sure that there are no edges that need to be covered up because once the cake is steamed for at least you know 5 or 10 minutes until it dries it's going to be really sticky and when it's sticky I'm not going to be able to smooth it or run a fondant smoother or anything like that over it because it was just stick the fondant smoother wouldn't know glide over the cake give these corners one final smooth so I also have some giant cradles that I made now stick those in place with the help of my scheme how did you make these things so to make these sprinkles I'm glad you asked because look I have some right here to make these sprinkles I just rolled out some snakes fondant right pretty thin and I've used my fondant smoother to roll them see sometimes when you're rolling now like a snake you got marks from your fingers but if you use a flat tool like a spotted smoother they're nice and flat and then I just use my knife to cut sprinkles let them dry for a few hours about a bing-bam-boom sprinkles baby exactly what I did and I just placed them on a paper towel so that the paper towel absorbs extra moisture and right away alright so here we go give this cake a little steam if you do make a lot of cakes so you can get a handheld steamer like this they're pretty cheap I think this is like just here two bucks so make sure I don't knock my sprinkles off the table alright alright so I'm only sticking the sprinkles to the chocolate part so I'll try and give this chocolate a good bit of steam so that it's nice enough isn't tacky or sticky so you always want to keep your steamer moving whenever you're steaming tape because you don't want the steam to bead up on this is because in a good run or the steam could form like a bunch of bubbles or water droplets and then runs so hopefully these all stick if not I'll just get a little more steam another we'll see what happens here stick very good so I am loving how this is turned out guys let me know what you think in the comment about how this cake looks so far I would normally spend a good amount of time here trying to space all of these colors out and make it like absolutely even imperfect right sprinkles not perfect now that's true he puts wriggled out of cake they kind of just fall all wherever they may write whatever they stick to things I always say yeah that's that's what I love about food cakes is that they really don't have to be perfect because foods not perfect right I mean less you obsess and try to make it perfect but usually food is pretty varied in its presentation all right I have one more piece I'm going to add to this popsicle and then it's going to be done and I'll have to devour the whole thing just kidding so just another message if the steamer wasn't available to here it wasn't really working I could just as easily grab a paintbrush and a little bit of piping gel which is another one of my favorite favorite mediums for sticking fondant to itself and uh the piping gel works really well because it's pretty sticky it's kind of like corn syrup but it has some gelatin in it so it's nice and sticky and it helps fondant stick to itself or stick to you know other things really well so on these edges here where maybe I need like a little more strength the piping gel is a pretty good go-to sweets add a few more of these what's on left last ones a pack guess what what does that another one this is also a great opportunity to cover up any like little air bubbles or dings that got my fondant get a little too excited cover your cake and you ding the fund and a big deal just cover it up with something right can you explain again why you're using shortening to stick this fondant to the fondant sure can't exactly yeah I said it right so after I covered my cake in green fondant I want it to or I added a panel of a chocolate fondant and then I've cut the excess a way to get the strip you look so shortening allowing you to stick the chocolate to the green but then be able to peel it back so the shortening isn't a permanent stick it's a temporary stick it will hold fondant in place stuck to itself but if you need to reposition something it's a repositionable hold I guess that's probably the good the best word to use it is reposition all right few more here I need a purple one and then I have a huge a lollipop stick or popsicles it stops popsicle stick this is one huge ice cream popsicle so calls for a huge popsicle stick all right one more sprinkles and I promise I'm done all right here we go it was pretty cool yeah yes does love it all right so let me grab my big popsicle stick so this is made from gum paste and I rolled some tan gum paste about a quarter of an inch thick I use my trusty ruler here to cut it three inches wide and then I just rounded the edge with a flexible blade and I made this a couple of days ago so on a dry nice and solid I have some skewers in it so they can stick all the way into the cake so what I'm going to do is find the center of my cake here so it's right there and I'm just going to make a little slit just to kind of give this a head start moment of truth add this popsicle stick and you'll be good to go if you guys are just joining this as the crowning glory of this ice cream possible cake so here we go so this should just go right in often there we go a gigantic ice cream popsicle cake because like I said I'm feeling the summer vibes just in time for the weekend these are now pretty cool we have our mid green-colored find a cake of this luscious fudgy chocolate drip on top some gigantic sprinkles you have a huge bite out of the cake of course because I mean come on ice cream popsicle this big of course I'd have to take a huge bite out of it then we have our big popsicle stick made out of gum paste it's not going anywhere if you guys do any final questions about this cake how we create it let us know in the comments below don't forget to check me on instagram at bait by dan and if you have a cool idea for a cake you'd like to see next week hit me in those comments below thanks for watching guys have an awesome weekend I'm Dan Langan I'll see you soon
so giant avocado what's up guys thanks for tuning in to Food Network live I'm Dan Langan tonight I'm here to blow your mind with this gigantic avocado cake I can't wait to show you guys this cake project and how it comes together is gonna be so awesome so grab some chips and guac get comfy don't go anywhere because you're not going to want to miss this so to create this giant avocado cake I had to prepare a few things ahead of time namely a whole nother cake which I have filled and frosted and covered in dommage it's a cards cake so if you want to see how I carve the cake or how I arrived as its shape here check out my Instagram story because I put the entire thing on my Instagram story so if you want to see how I carved it and got to the shape check it out there first they have to do to start a new avocado is put the light green fleshy part on top so what I did was a pre rolls and funding just to you know save you guys the time of watching you roll fondant out so I have some fondant here free rolls and I have a little bit of simple syrup in my spray bottle we switching it up this week usually I really fuse vodka for this stuff but have a little bit of simple syrup in my bottle and I have my piece of fondant that's rule now so I'll just grab my PVC pipe I'll turn my cake sideways and I will roll this on top so if you guys are just tuning in I'm Dan Lyons from baked by Dan you can check me out you can check my facebook all right there so if you guys see this right here I'm just going to unroll this right on top of the cake pretty easy and then I'll grab my fondant mover which is right here and I'll give it a smooth and then what I'm going to do to cut this nice and even around the outsides just so I have a nice clean cut is actually flip the cake over so there's a lot of cake flipping in this design so before I flip the cake I'm going to place a piece of parchment paper on I'm going to grab my board cake board and I'll pick the cake up so my cake is nice and cold I filled this cake in frosting so in front of this cake last night and carved it this morning so little tip there hold your cake very tight in there flipping over right so now that I can kind of see the edge of the cake could be a lot easier to cut the edge and you can see on the cake that I created already the the skin of avocado goes right up to the green right here so to get a really nice edge right here that whole process starts with how I cut this green so I'm taking a craft knife here and I'm angling my knife out to follow the the outward angle of the rest of the cake and I'm just cutting the fondant away right along the side of the cake so I'm try and do this nice and slowly because this edge will show on the final cake so I want it to look pretty good so some of you guys may be wondering why I created a ginormous 25 pound avocado cake and the really simple reason it's just because I love avocados so now that you know spring is here and summer is on its way in Pennsylvania avocados are really abundant I eat them all the time actually love them and if you guys are into healthy baking or like baking with healthy alternatives you probably know that since avocados are so rich in fat you can use them to sub out for some of the butter in your baking so if you're making like a banana bread or chocolate chip muffin or something like that you can use avocado in place of some or all of the butter in your recipe so you have to be willing to experiment on that one but I've done it and works pretty good so I'll peel this away put my green farm in the way so I can use it for later so not have a nice clean edge right so I'll put my craft knife away and before I move on before I move on to rolling out the skin of the avocado I'm going to grab some piping gel and a little paintbrush and what I'm going to do it's just paint some piping gel along the bottom of this fondant strip right here that's just because I want the side of this one to be really nice and sticky so that when I attach the avocado skin to this whole cake it adheres to the top and I get like a nice a nice connection with the fondant so that the whole thing looks pretty seamless as that makes sense so if you guys are just tuning in we are school uh well cakes re sculpted but we are decorating and designing this epic ginormous avocado cake if you guys love avocados let us know in the comments below let us know what you think so far and if you have any questions about this process or about baking very even questions about me whatever you want to know put them in the comments below I'd love to answer them and if you guys attempt this cake please share it on my Facebook page because I'd like to check it out so a lion wants to know what colors new Nick's to get that color fondant the greeting yes alive I'm so glad you asked that question so to get my colors here I actually spent a lot of time studying an avocado so I got an avocado I cut it open and I had it sitting there on the table as I was putting the cake together um so to make this green I use electric green I used a warm brown and I also use a little bit of golden yellow which is like a brown yellow so I'm going to just slide my cake out of the way here so they need a lot of space to roll out my avocado colored skin so to get this color right here for the skin I mix together moss-green i mix together chocolate brown fondant and I added a little bit of black and a little bit of copper because avocados actually have kind of like some red undertones to them in the skin so with colors with kind of off colors like this it's really helpful to like I said have the actual objects on the table when you're mixing the color and it's also helpful to combine a lot of colors together there's not really like once that color for what an avocado skin would be so you guys can see that this is really nice and stretchy if you've seen me work with fondant before you know that I always say that I microwaved my fondant before I start kneading it just so it's nice and soft and I have some shortening on my hands and I'm using that to knead this till it's nice and smooth so once it looks pretty stretchy which it does I'm going to get it ready to roll out so I'll gather all of my kind of creases to the back now get a nice clean top the great thing about this designer here is that avocado skin is by no means smooth that's completely scratching and crazy-looking right so if there are some dents to be able to this totally know the deal and I racked my brain right trying to figure out how I was going to texture this fondant to make it look like an avocado skin and I came up with a little technique that I'm super excited about it actually uses corn kernels that are inside a little plastic bag so stay tuned for that feel cool so have some corn starch on my table I'll grab my PVC pipe just going to start rolling this app go from side to side guys don't forget to share this video on your Facebook page share it with a friend to is totally into baking share it with someone who loves avocados I don't know anyone else that has made a gigantic avocado cake so I was pretty pretty pumped when I made this cake Kayla wants to know what you use to make the pet Kayla Kaitlyn I owe Kaitlyn a great question so yeah we'll get to the pit the pit is actually a six inch apt sphere cake so I just use my half handling my six inch balls and to make the pay so I was just popping some air bubbles on my fondant like I said probably really wouldn't even matter because their air bubbles in the fondant once they're textured on top about it or not even really on to see it but and I'll keep putting my hands under here moving this around just make sure it's not sticking trying to roll in all directions here okay so this definitely looks wide enough I'm gonna make this a little bit smaller or think we can going to tighter shot here on this fondant rolling so I'll just roll from the center out and then around back another direction and if I see any big like rolling pin marks I can kind of pop them out with the rolling pin okay so I'm not too worried about this being like a super even thickness because any irregularities are just kind of going to add to the natural look of this whole thing right so let's see here I'll roll my fondant up on my rolling pin if there's a ton of cornstarch I'll just brush that off if I roll it just cuz I don't want any barrier between my fondant in my cake because I want to stick in place right all right so I'll grab my draw go check avocado and uh it's pretty humid so you know what this this ganache is already pretty sticky but I'll just give it a really quick mist with simple syrup and you guys will see on the base of this avocado before I flip it back over this is a piece of foam core board the bottom quarter of this cake is solid bright cereal treat so I layered it together like a normal cake buttercream cake buttercream cake but the bottom layer is for a cereal treat that's because the shape of this cake requires a really good sturdy base so out of rice cereal and then I have flown or and this is not sticky because I'm going to cut this piece of fondant away right all right so I'll pull this little closer to me and then starting with the fondant right at the bottom of the avocado I'm going to start rolling this on up and over first thing I want to do is smooth my front part a shape like this is pretty easy to cover because there aren't really any sharp corners or anything like that so I'll just move it over with my hands I'll get rid of this crease right here smooth that down and I'll just do the same thing all the way around so guys like I said if you're curious about how I arrived at this shape prior to covering it in fondant and all that check out my Instagram at base by Dan because I have all your guys's backs I got had you guys in mind I figured it would probably one in two high-carb the cake so it's all on my Instagram story when I was carving and ganache seeing this cake earlier today I put in my Instagram story along with some instructions so if you're curious on how I did it and you'd like to attempt it just head over to instagram @ face idea and you can check it out you can see that covered pretty easily and I want this bottom edge to be pushed in and attached to the cake pretty nicely because I want it to attach to I want this skin color to attach to that flesh that light green right so just for one quick smooth before I move on I'm taking some of this extra fondant I'll need it to get rid of those dry corn starchy bits and then I'll just give a little smooth but I'm really going to be rocking this up in a second anyway so this may not matter but I don't know if the cake designer and me that can't let me cover a cake and not at least give a little bit so now I need to expose this base this piece of foam core so I'm just going to start just by cutting the fondant away just until I can see that foam core and then I'm going to lay my knife so it's flat on the foam core and just use the foam core board as a guide keeping my knife pretty level as I just turn it around so now I still have a nice solid base for my avocado cake to sit on which is really important whenever you're doing a sculpted cake like this where all of this cake is tapering out and it's sitting on just a little you know little piece this is probably like I don't know a sixth of the entire base of the cake you want to make sure that your cakes are nice and solid so ganache really also helps with that because ganache is solid or in temperature so I'll grab my sculpting tool and now I'm going to do is just use the sculpting tool actually maybe first before I do that I'll just use my fondant smoother and just use the sharp end of the fondant smoother to really start to just push that fondant in because I want a nice solid feel like good contact with this fondant to the edge of the sink so now that I've gone around with my fondant smoother I'll just use my sculpting tool and I'm just pushing this skin colored fondant the avocado skin fondant into the side of the cake as I just turn it around so if you guys are just joining we are coming up on one of my favorite parts of this technique and that is the texturing technique of the avocado I was nearly jumping up and down when I figure this out because I was so excited it's always so cool when you come up with a new technique even add to your cake decorating repertoire so all right so now what I'll do is grab my craft knife again mmm and I'm just going to cut about like the quarter of a half an inch away from the cake away from the edge of the cake and then I'm not going to cut the fondant away until I flip the cake back over one more time so I'll cut this away and now I'm going to grab my very high-end avocado skin texturing tools which is just some corn kernels in a plastic bag and just by pushing these corn kernels into the fondant with a good amount of pressure it makes this really awesome texture maybe since I have two of them I can do like two sides at a time double time air and so guys like I said I did a ton of research on avocados as I was putting this cake together because whenever I make a food cake I want it to be as realistic as possible and I know that I love avocados and everyone that I know loves avocados but I was really surprised to hear that the United States alone grows like 200,000 tons right 200,000 tons of avocados every single year and not surprisingly the majority of those come from California not Pennsylvania but it's a heck of a lot of avocados so you'll see here I'm taking these corn kernels in this sandwich baggie and just pressing it into the cake and the cool thing about using something organic and natural like this to texture cake in fact every time I press into the cave is going to look completely different like it's not going to it's not going to give me the same texture you know at each turn so when I first tried this I used rice but the rice was just too fine and the texture that it made was just almost like too fine and delicate for something this size I think that a corn works a whole lot better but if you guys have a cool idea of how I could texture this cake you know let me know in the comments below buttons I'm not too proud to hear other people's ideas so I'll go around there's just a few more times when I made this original cake I probably spent about a good ten minutes of texturing it but I won't put you guys through all that alright so the next thing I want to do is just add kind of these pinchy pinchy like veiny things that you see in an avocado I don't really know how to describe it I guess you would just call them like scars I don't know like scanners like imperfections so to do that all really going to do is just pinch the fondant together and run my fingers around it I noticed these like I said as I was you know getting a friendly with avocados checking them out so I'll use my sculpting tool here to can also if I want to make any like deeper marks I can use my sculpting tool for that so I'm pretty happy with the color of this but once the entire cake is done I'm going to hit it with some airbrush I really like to airbrush food cakes whenever I can because the really subtle like color variations that you can get with an airbrush really brings food cakes to life whenever you spend time texturing a cake like this when you then airbrush that cake all of the texture really comes to life and that's what really kind of brings the design over the top and makes it look super realistic I think so let's just do it one more right here cool so I'm about to my core in one more time if you guys are just joining in this my patented avocado texturing technique is corn kernel inside the family's bag press it into the fondant you have yourself some avocado texture so let's go out in here but what about that look I'll just push the air bubble wrap Claudia wants to know what cyber take your even today Claudia this is a yellow butter cake I wanted to use butter cake so that was nice and solid so that you know stay together really well and then I filled it with a lime buttercream it's an American buttercream but it has some lime juice and some lime zest okay so now to flip this cake over I'm going to grab my base again right I'm going to put the base right on the center of the cake make sure my hands are nice and dry I'll pet myself up a little bit before I do this it's like you're in the gym you're up to you like something really crazy right awesome so now if I did my work well which it looks like I did you should see that we have a nice solid connection there between that lime green flesh color you know skin avocado flesh and the skin or the meat of the avocado I wasn't quite sure what terminology to use and I was talking about the skin versus of you know flesh and all that so but there are actual names so before I cut this I'm just going to use my hands and just really gently kind of gather just spun it up the sides and then I'll use my knife and I'll just cut it away so I'll use the palm of my hand just to smooth this fondant in and because I put piping gel on the very cut edge of this lime green part right here it's nice and smooth so I'll grab out a sharp paring knife and I'm just going to really gently cut into the fondant and then use the top green part I just want to use this top green part right here and my knife just to cut this skin away and I'll just rotate the cake probably like every quarter turn so guys if you're loving this video share it with your friends who are into begging or into cakes share with your friends that are avocado lovers share it with everybody now and if you have any questions about what I'm doing or questions about baking whatever you guys want to know just hit me in the comments below be happy to answer them if you guys have a sculpted cake picture that you'd like to share I love checking out other people's projects so share your photo bolon we can all check it out awesome alright so if my edge looks a little rough from cutting all I have to do is just push that in with my finger right don't get rid of that rough edge but I kind of like how it looks because I think it looks really natural right because when you cut an avocado in half it you know certainly doesn't always look like you know you cut it apart with I don't know princess floss or something so potentially something I made up but it makes sense right so I'll just smooth this down with my hands and so the next thing that I have to do is add my pick so I'm going to grab my turntable so it's easy to move this cake around I'll put the cake up on the turntable what of you guys might be wondering why this finished avocado cake is sitting on a pink base it's just simply because I thought to see pink would look really great with the avocado because pink and you know lime green or complementary colors but I'm not too sure about how I feel about the pink myself but we'll see so let me grab my avocado pit here and I made this avocado pit by taking all of the carvings from this cake this was two quarter sheet cakes I took all of the carvings mix them up with you know spatulas and buttercream basically made cake top men and then put that all in a six-inch cast fear pan and I got this I covered in brown fondant and I painted it with a little bit of ivory food coloring and vodka to give it that the textured look and I have a completely awesome technique that I'm going to show you guys to add that look of gosh on what you would call it like when you cut an avocado in half right and you see the pit the pit always has some of the flesh from the other side on it right so the way to get that flesh or that you know chunky little bit that you'll see on the finished cake right here is to actually just take some of the same green fondant that we used to make the top of the cake give a little bit of need with our fingers I'm going to add a little bit of water to it just straight water and then using you know a spoon or a palette knife or whatever we're just going to mix the two together until it's nice and chunky doesn't have to be smooth because you know usually avocados or avocado flesh on the inside because in smooths we'll just make it license nice and spreading nice and chunky like this some people do this to fix cracks in their cake if you have a crack and your fondant you can thin the fondant down like this but I was trying to think of a final detail to add to my avocado cake and I was like oh I need to add some of this green green fleshy bit to the tip and this is why I came up with so I have a pastry brush right just bumping into the light no big deal guys don't be alarmed so I'll load this onto a pastry brush and basically I'll going to do is just brush it on adds just a little bit more water just because it's a little super sticky but you guys can see this is totally already starting look like an avocado with just a little bit more texturing and some airbrush we're going to be set awesome so yeah I just want these like chunky chunky pieces brush a little before right here it's like my main spot right there all right one more spot and then guys I'm about to bring out the airbrush because like I said I don't think any salted food cake is complete without a little bit of airbrushing so so far I think this looks pretty sweet I'm a pralaya I'm really happy with it get rid of this little bit of water right here if you guys are just joining we still have a couple more cool steps to finish up this avocado cake make sure to check out my facebook at baked by Dan check out my instagram at base pride and i have a full full lineup on my instagram story of how I got to this shape and how I sculpted this cake down you guys can check it out and once this cake is finished I'm going to be cutting into it so you're just going to want to stick around for that so to airbrush my cake I'm going to use a little bit of black a little bit of brown and then a little bit of lime green which fittingly is actually going on color green so I'm going to plug in my airbrush a little bit loud you know don't be startled this and I'm gonna shake up my airbrush color a little bit of green and then I'm just going to airbrush very gently the side of the cake I'm just aiming for the very side just want to add a little bit of green color precisely it's important to keep your cake moving whenever you're airbrushing it because you don't want any of those really solid color spots so my airbrush keeps moving and my cake [Music] and now of the take just the very edge where the skin meet the avocado flesh I'll make some sauces hold it darker our Coty's are never you know perfectly well color maybe I'll hit the core just a little bit and now I'm just going to grab my black I'll leave a little bit of the green that's in there a couple drops black and a couple drops of brown and I'm just going to use these just to highlight some of these cuts or some of these texture marks [Music] just for some color variation in the skin [Music] I'll hit the bottom of the cake a little bit added look of shadow and just some drama to that I'll make sure I attach the little pinched bits that I added there so now going with a bit more Brown and I'll add just a couple of those signature brown spots that are in the green and this cake will be good to go right just cleaning out that little folder [Music] I'm always bummed out when I cut into an avocado and I'm like so pumped to eat it and it has a brown sauce but I'm looking for a realism here so but I got and there we go sculpted avocado paint from base began sweet now I have two ginormous avocado cakes I don't know what went up to have some friends over and have like a China Mikado cake party if you guys have any questions leave them down in the comments below but we're going to cut this cake don't you worry so since I've been working on this one it's probably nice and soft let's cut this one right here actually before I forget guys I'm missing one of the best parts we have to add this little stem you know to the top of the cake I just saw it on here you can have an avocado without a little without a little stem on top right I like to call it the bellybutton of the avocado I'm sure that's not a technical name you can call it whatever you want but what I'm going to do to make the little nub of the avocado is a little stem is just take some of my leftover Brown the same Brown that I used for the pit I almost call it the core I'll just roll it into a little ball push that in place and then I'll take my ball tool and just give a little bit of shape just like that it's those small details that make such a difference I think whenever you're creating a food cake so camera girl thanks for reminding me about that so what do you guys think two gigantic sculpted avocado cakes what I love about these cakes is how different they are I mean them using the same process but they both look pretty different if you guys are curious if you didn't see when I was texturing the cake I use this really cool texturing technique I took some unpopped corn kernels in a sandwich bag and I just pressed those corn kernels into the cake totally cool technique it gives you a really realistic avocado texture so the moment everyone's been waiting for people may not believe that this is the real cake but I assure you guys it is so let's cut it open so I have a knife right here let's just get a nice big meaty slice right straight down in the back so i frosted this cake with ganache because i really like using ganache for sculpted cakes because it's nice and solid but you could use buttercream you were just have to make sure your cakes stay nice and cold while you were working on it check that out yellow buttermilk cake filled with some lime buttercream if you want to make lime buttercream you can just use your favorite American buttercream recipe use fresh lime juice for whatever liquid you were put in the buttercream and if you feel so inclined you can put a little bit of lime zest in there it's delicious it's refreshing it has a nice little zing that contrasts against the sweetness of the cake really nicely so check it out lime buttercream super easy to make there you go guys because we're wrapping this up don't forget to check out my facebook page at Bates right and check me out on Instagram API and let me know what you guys would like to see next week because I spend a lot of time thinking about all these projects to bring the guys so I love your input everybody has an awesome weekend thanks for watching I'm Dan Lang and I'll see you soon

[music playing] SKYLER BOUCHARD: Who is the sugar monster? What is the sugar monster? Anyone who is obsessed with sweets, first and foremost, and just having fun. We're not just your standard bakery. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Yeah, I've never seen anything like that. ASHLEY HOLT: They're little works of art, and just loud and fun. It took me a long time before I was able to actually find my own personal style. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Where do you get the inspiration? Because I can't just think of that out of thin air, you know? My brain's a little crazy. When I did this cake, there is this beautiful, beautiful rock called an aurora crystal. It's like a magical fairy unicorn rock that you look inside. And it is just rainbows inside of this rock. And you just thought, oh my gosh, let me turn that into a cake because I can? ASHLEY HOLT: Yeah. All right, show me how this is done. Pick up a little cluster. SKYLER BOUCHARD: All right. As long as you just paint all of them a different color, then it looks like holograms. Every single one? Oh my gosh. Well, let's get started then. When did you decide to go full time with this? ASHLEY HOLT: 14 months ago. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Wow! What were you doing before this? ASHLEY HOLT: I was working as a culinary producer and food stylist. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, wow, so this is really up your alley? ASHLEY HOLT: The inside of this cake is a sprinkle cake, a vanilla sprinkle cake, which is our most popular. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, nice. ASHLEY HOLT: Yeah, filled with a fruity cereal pastry cream. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, my god, I'm going to cry. ASHLEY HOLT: It's a very competitive industry. And it's super important for me to stay, you know, ahead of the trend and just on the forefront of people's minds. We have to put our own spin on it. So we're cutting it differently. We're using different rocks, mixing in more gold, adding in the drips. SKYLER BOUCHARD: And also I noticed, you have all these tattoos. And they are kind of food related. What inspired these? What's-- ASHLEY HOLT: Well, this is my sugar monster. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Wee, so that's the one. ASHLEY HOLT: Yeah. This sugar monster has a big pink swirly ice cream cone hair. SKYLER BOUCHARD: That's what that is. ASHLEY HOLT: Yeah. SKYLER BOUCHARD: OK, yeah ASHLEY HOLT: --jagged teeth because half of them fell out from the sugar, and holding a purple cake. SKYLER BOUCHARD: What was the first job offer you turned down because you were like, I'm doing this, and I'm doing it full time? It actually happened like five months ago. And it was going to take me away to Austin, Texas. Oh my gosh, I was going to make about $75,000 on the job. How did that feel? It felt scary a bit. But it also felt very good. I was very proud of myself. I mean, it's incredible. The clients that we've been able to have recently and just the experiences, and I would have missed out on all of that. SKYLER BOUCHARD: This is so cool. I feel like I'm a mad scientist, and I haven't even done anything. I'm just standing here watching you. So do you have any words of advice for any millennials trying to start a baking business? Find your own style. Be smart with your money. And to be completely fearless, and know that it is going to be hard before it gets easy. Yeah. Just don't give up. And then it turns into this. SKYLER BOUCHARD: It's so pretty. ASHLEY HOLT: I know. It's just beautiful. Well, I'm going to cut into this thing. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, girl. You're not ready for this. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Wow! Look at that. It's as beautiful on the inside as it is on the outside. - That's how a human should be. - Yeah. --like cakes especially. Yeah. [laughs]
[music playing] MELISSA TAVSS: This is our boozy ice cream flight. This is kind of a play off of like what you would get at a distillery if you were going to like taste different whiskies. So how did you even get into this? Well, I love cocktails. And I used to work for different wine and spirits brands. I was like 26. I went back to NYU because I was like, I don't know what I want to do, and then on the side kind of started doing events with Tipsy Scoop. It really was an accidental business, like I didn't know what I was doing. I was making the ice cream in Tupperware in my kitchen one pint at a time. One pint took 20 minutes. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, I'm so excited to try these. Let's dig in. MELISSA TAVSS: There is liquor in there. It's 8:00 in the morning. Oh man. It's OK. If you saw the amount of liquor that comes in and out of our production facility, I don't know what they think we're doing, but-- They're probably worried. What's the percentage? So it's up to 5% alcohol by volume, the equivalent of a light beer. All the ice creams are like what I like. So I try to like make the cocktail first and then like translate into an ice cream or a sorbet. SKYLER BOUCHARD: And how do you get the consistency on this? Like a lot of recipes call for a shot of vodka or like a shot of bourbon to like soften it. Then I was like, how cool would it be if it actually held an alcohol content. Yeah. MELISSA TAVSS: So this is like the fan favorite. And it's kind of a mouthful to say-- dark chocolate whisky salted caramel. That's the full name. Dark chocolate whisky salted caramel. Yeah. OK. Mm. And this is only in the retail store. This is only in our store, yes. In the store front. Yeah, exactly. [music playing] MELISSA TAVSS: Brick and mortar really wasn't like in the business plan, but what happened was we have a commercial kitchen up in East Harlem and people started coming there like thinking it was an ice cream shop. After that happened, we were like, we've got to-- We've got to find a way to get flights of liquor-infused ice cream to the people because they need that. What was the hardest thing? MELISSA TAVSS: We just like didn't know what we were doing, which was kind of a blessing because we weren't like scared. But there were so many hurdles that we had to jump over. Because there's alcohol infused into the ice cream, It was really hard to get it into grocery stories. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Legally. MELISSA TAVSS: They like pulled it from the shelves. So how do we card people for it? So now we have like federal government approval declaring it a non-beverage. We don't need a liquor license to sell it. We just have to card people. The most important thing that I learned was you really have to be persistent. Do you think that you would have been able to do this before social media and the internet? Before I had the Instagram following, I really depended on my friends and family for word-of-mouth. The social media component is huge, but you still have to put yourself out there. It really just is crazy how fast it can get your name out there. I mean, it's really hard to start something new that people don't know about. But it's kind of about just like taking a bet on yourself. Go with your gut and then everything else will figure itself out. Well, thank you so much. This was delicious. And it was so great to hear your story. Thank you for coming. I'm going to take these to-go. MELISSA TAVSS: Thanks for coming. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Thank you. [music playing]

Today on "Feel Good" with me, Hannah, we're making a chocolate mousse with a secret ingredient. Avocado. [music playing] I love this recipe because it's the same consistency as a regular mousse, but it's totally guilt free. The key to this is using a ripe avocado. The difference between an unripe avocado is that it's green and hard to touch. But a ripe avocado is brown and very easy on the thumb. So I love this recipe because it's great for a dinner party because you can make it beforehand and chill it. The reason why you want to use a ripe avocado is so that it all blends very easily. After I add the avocado, I'm going to add the cocoa powder. And cocoa powder is full of antioxidants. I'm also going to add an unsweetened almond milk, which makes this a really great vegan dessert option. But if dairy's not an issue, then you can use any milk you want. Maple syrup as my sweetener. But you can use honey or agave instead. But it should definitely be liquid. I'm also going to add vanilla and a pinch of salt. Now I'm going to blend this on low for about two minutes. [clock ticking] [bell ding] This looks about perfect. Oh yeah. It's light and creamy. Exactly how we want it. I've made two servings here. And although you can consume this immediately and it is delicious, I think it's much better after you chill it for about 30 minutes. Whoa. Whoops. While this is chilling, I'm going to clean up and get ready for the best part-- toppings. Now comes the fun part. Here are all the toppings that I'm going to use, at least. But you can use whatever toppings you'd like. I'm doing a bunch of fruit. I've got raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries, which I think adds like a nice layer of sweetness as well as color. This is a great dessert to make for a dinner party because you could have a little toppings bar where everyone puts their own toppings on it which would be so cute. Then I've made coconut whipped cream, which I think is great, super easy, as an alternative to regular whipped cream. All you do is you take a can of coconut milk and you put it in the refrigerator overnight so that it hardens and separates. The top layer will be hard like this and underneath will be coconut water, which you can use for a smoothie or on its own. Then I'm going to add some cocoa nibs which give it a nice, crunchy layer, as well as some chia seeds. And even some coconut chips. Let's taste this. Mmm. This is amazing. I hope you enjoyed the episode this week. Catch me next time on "Feel Good" with me, Hannah.

hey guys what's up I'm Dan lying in your favorite cake daiquiri or at least lame itself and it's Friday night next weekend is Memorial Day which here on the East Coast equals the unofficial start of summer so that means I'll be the beach and I'll be grilling so I wanted to make this awesome light-up grill cake I made this cake last year for a 21st birthday it was really popular on social media so I figured I'd show you guys how I make it cool as far as this cake I think is that actually lights up in the middle so if you want to get a quick shot of that while I'm getting my second cake set up I'll show you guys all the steps it takes to make this cake so they're actually some little LED lights that are made for cake decorating and the center of the cake and makes it you know look lit up like embers which I think it's really cool so to make this cake first thing I have to do is start with a short cake here and cover it in black fondant I already did just in the interest of time so I have to roll out a strip of black fondant place around the top of shape let me just move this out of the way and I'll grab some one side and some black fondant so if you guys have watched me before here on Food Network on the free to our Facebook page you guys know that I love talking baking and cakes and answering your questions hopefully our questions pop up today sometimes you have some issues with them so if they don't get to answer your questions I apologize but try and speculate waiting so right here I have some black fondant and I just to go with black just because my girl is black so I figured it'd be a pretty cool color and then it highlights all the color food on top of the cake you'll see my fondant here is nice and stretchy it's actually not too hard to get at this consistency right now because it's been about 90 degrees right now in Pennsylvania for the past few days so we're like Miss heatwaves so fondant and buttercream and all of those things are super soft so what I'm doing here is just getting this fondant ready to roll out a strip to place down on the top part of my crib so if you guys have ever created a a barbecue cake you know grill cake something to get ready for Memorial Day or convening in the summer we'd love to check out your photos I love seeing all the stuff you guys create so in the comments below share a picture of what you made so everybody can do it and if you want to check out my facebook page you can find me on Facebook at Bayside and you can also find me on Instagram I have a pretty cool Instagram story no update all day as I was working on this barbeque cake so if you guys kind of want to see some in process shop you can check them out on Instagram or you can just get really comfortable right now and I'm not going where because so follow me through and I'll show you how I'm getting ready for Memorial Day all right so I'm rolling my fondant out hopefully about 30 inches long I have 30 inches marked on my table so see here my cake is a 10 inch cake so 30 into 30 inches or a little over 30 inches shoot me all the way around my page so I'm just using my finest wheeler to smooth it out I'll grab what's called a ribbon cutter and I'm just going to cut an even strip of black fondant out of here and I want to save all this glass on it and use it to make all of the charcoal briquets my barbecue inside here all right so now what I have to do is flip my take over I don't even have to wet this tape because the humidity in the air is making some condensation take already so I'm going to place a cake drum or just a stack of cake circles top of my cake flip it over no matter how many times I do that my heart always tough for a second every time and the reason that I'm flipping my cake over very simply is just because I need a rim of fondant around the top of my cake and I think it's much easier to do when my cake is upside down so I'm just going to pull this strip right up to the side of my cake and then wrap it all the way around and I'll meet the camera back here at the time and then you guys can't see this right here what I'm doing is just using the table as a guide to get a nice flat rim here and then we're these three pieces of fondant joint together what I want to do is just cut through both of them get rid of that little extra wedge and it'll grab something sticky like piping gel and use it to catch these two edges of fondant together push those together you're really strapped here but I'm going to grab my fondant smoother and then just smooth around the side of this just like I'm smoothing fondant on the cage normally a lot of people ask me what type of fun and I like to use I use whatever I have available sometimes when I'm using black fondant like this or what I'm using dark navy or or red I like to buy it just because those really dark colors are kind of hard to mix especially if you're starting with white fondant so if it's a dark color I buy it whatever whatever is available if it's a lighter color or white I really like to make marshmallows on it it's super easy to make if you search online for marshmallow fondant you will find some really great recipes and you just have to experiment as with all recipes and you know find one that works for you so here I have a 14 inch cake board I covered it with some green fondant and textured it a little bit with a clean tea towel and I'm actually going to put my cake on top of it so it looks like my grill is sitting in the grass although the grill cake that I create it for the demo I made to look like it was sitting the beach for this next week I'll be grilling a tree you know indifference so now what I have to do here is just take my cake up all right so I'm going to place the spatula on my board and then place the tape around top of the spatula looks pretty centered I'll just peel that right off and then I'll peel this board out and now I have a nice rim of fondant assuming I can get this off assuming that the condensation has it made it completely stick so if you're in an area that's really humid and finding fondant is always sticky every working out of cakes one thing you might consider doing is switching Sigyn osh ganache is really easy to work with it's great for coating cakes because it doesn't have to be refrigerated so if your cake isn't cold and it's not going to get a bunch of condensation and I'm actually not even going to worry about all of this corn searched because all of the condensation that will gather on it has got to kind of make it all disappear so onto some fun stuff you can't have a barbecue that curtiss-wright cheeseburgers it's me so I have some brown modeling-chocolate here and I'm just going to give it an E very simply until the the cracks kind of go away you need it so it gets nice and soft modeling chocolate is basically just a mixture of chocolate and corn syrup I actually have my favorite recipe for modeling chocolate on my blog which is baking with Viacom so you guys can check it out there and you can also find the recipes for the cake I use this is actually in the apology cake with chocolate and vanilla cake filled with strawberry buttercream super delicious I think it's a really nostalgic American cake and a great way to take off summer so I'm just shaping some rough cheeseburgers here out of this modeling chocolate and I say ruff because the you know the shape of nothing perfect and I'm just going to take a piece of aluminum foil that I crinkled up and just texture the sides of these burgers and then I'm going to take a mixture of piping gel vodka and a little bit of reddish brown food color and I'll paint these so that they look really juicy and meaty and you know I'll sizzling a scrumptious like they're growing up so if you're a cake decorator it's really cool to find different things around your workspace like parchment paper or a limited foil board you know whatever you have and use it to texture your fondant or your modeling chocolate so I'll place these ramasees a parklet and then I'm just going to grab this mix here that I've pre put together it's just vodka so that it dries a little bit of warm brown food color so you get that nice meaty red look and then some piping gel which adds that you know greasy kind of juicy look to these burgers and then after this dries I'll put some modeling chocolate cheese on top so I'll set these aside or set these aside for just a moment all right so before I move on to tweenie I guess the great on my grill what I have to do is roll out a long sausage of fondant that's going to fit all the way around cake good good look at that k there so we're going to be creating the shrimp I'm going to show you guys how I make the kabobs they're all made out of fondant or modeling chocolate everything is edible even the little even a little great pieces they're actually fettuccine pasta that I painted with some black food coloring so - the LED cake lights everything's edible which i think is really cool so mister only had a make a black fondant here I want to try and give this a nice and even and I want it to kind of be thickness of the height of that that that rim that I just created on my grill so people always ask what I like to use to roll my fondant up you know cornstarch or powdered sugar I prefer cornstarch but whenever I'm rolling a shape like this you'll notice that I don't let me have any powdered sugar or corn starch on my table because if I did instead of this rolling it would just kind of flop around and like turn into like a flat shrimp like a flat thing it it would really be what I was looking for some milk cornstarch gets the job done just fine so I'll cut one end flat and I'll line this end up with the previous scene that I had and I'll just carefully place this all the way around the cake so this is going to give me some height to rest my pieces of black fettuccine on sounds funny saying black fettuccine but um yeah black fettuccine that I have to make the great through my grille cut this with a nice sharp knife and then join these two pieces together so push this app just until it's rounded don't they actually make black haha they do make black pasta I believe it's a squid ink pasta yes I know that that's the thing I've actually never eaten it I don't know if I would give him the chance but they do make black pasta yeah alright so I'm just smoothing this back out and then what I'm going to do is make some charcoal briquettes because you can have a charcoal grill without charcoal briquets right so back to my black fondant really simple here these little charcoal briquettes add a lot of detail to this cake so I have some pre-prepared I'll take my fondant and all I'm really going to do is roll it into circles kind of flatten it down and then square it out and I'll paint these with some white food color so that they look kind of would actually be the word a lit I don't know burning hot hot charcoal briquettes so I'll make a few more of these and then I'm going to grab some white food color and a patient rush I'll put some of this western color into a little custard conference and a little bit goes a long way here so kind of want this to be like a dry brushed look and I'm just going to brush these no real like rhyme or reason doesn't have to be even maybe some size or white and you know some stay solid black you know for visual interest so if you guys are just joining right now I'm using some black fondant and some white food coloring to make some sharp over tests for my barbecued roll cake which I'm making in excited preparation for Memorial Day which is next weekend so this is the cake I'll be making again next so you're ready for my Memorial Day celebration because there's nothing like a crazy cake to uh to kick off the celebration especially being a stubborn so alright so now comes the really cool part my favorite part of this cake the lights alright so these little LED lights can be bought online they light up they're actually pretty bright you can see how bright they are and they're made for for cakes and decorating food obviously they aren't edible but they're not going to hurt your cake by you know placing them on top of the cake if I were making this cake for a client and like I said this cake is just for me I would advise the client that there are six LED lights in the center of the cake that are edible and then they would know to take them out but anytime you see a cake whether it's a car cake with lights that light up or fire truck or a monster tank with light-up eyes that light always comes from me little LED lights so I'll place these in the center of the cake and then what I'm going to do is take my charcoal briquettes and just start playing them around the outside it's funny when I made this cake last year for 21st birthday I really did do some research into what a charcoal grill looked like because I haven't grilled on a charcoal grill since I was you know much younger with my dad hanging out over the summer I feel like everyone uses gas through a charcoal grill makes a much cooler cake than a gas grill would for sure so I'm just going to make a couple more of these little charcoal pieces some black fondant some white food coloring if you guys are just joining I'm Dan Lyon I'm decorating this grill cake you can check out my facebook page baked by Dan we have we have the link to that right at the the top of this broadcast here and then to make these embers this part that lights up in the center what I have here is just a mixture of crushed up rock candy I have some clear some yellow and some orange and what I want to do is just make the top of these lights just a little bit sticky with some piping gel so everything kind of sticks together so I can pile up the rock candy on top and then the lights illuminate the rock candy from the underside and it looks like the grill is really lit my absolute favorite part of this cake and these lights actually stay lit for several days which is pretty cool really surprised the first time that I use them a couple years ago and they stayed lit for you know like several days so I'm just going to try and keep this rock-candy right towards the center here I'll just gradually cover these up and you can see right away is a really awesome effect that you get from the rocket can be being illuminated by the LED light you could also use coarse sugar here I guess if you had a sanding sugar you could probably set as well I'm laughing here because my my camera girl absolutely loves getting shit on cooking so it's kind of a little inside joke between us so now my grill is completely lit looks like it's ready to go all I have to do is place some rums on top now it's important that this outer edge here is about the same height as my my bro test because what I'm going to do is just place some pieces of this black set of Cheaney right across the cake and I want the fettuccine to kind of set right on the edge of the grill get rid of some of this cornstarch here and then if I need to cut any of these I can do that really easily just by pinching off the end so I'll place one and maybe like every inch or so and if it's not sticking I'll just grab a little bit of piping gel just stick that down but once I place my burgers and and sewers on top well that's going to stick with no problem so I colored these fettuccine just by mixing together some black food gel that you know I would use to color fondant word anything like that and I mixed that with some vodka and the reason I used vodka is because it wouldn't hydrate the pasta like the vodka didn't make the pasta mushy so basically I just made like black watercolor you know using the the vodka and the black food diet and after a couple coats I had these black pieces of fettuccine and they're strong enough to support the weight of the little food pieces I'll put on top because of the help of these little charcoal pieces right here look that broke good thing I have an extra so a great tip for someone like this is to always have an extra you never know if you're going to need it alright so one more here place that down just lay some burgers on top let's get this thing going give some life here so one burger there let's see I want to try and not cover up my lights in the center too much so I'll place these burgers right side by side let's make some let's make some kebab make some some skewers let's see I have some uh some ivory colored modeling chocolate here and I use it to make some uh some mushrooms where you sewers I'm actually just going to use more fettuccine as my little skewer pieces I knew that I could have just used regular Shearer's but I was going for you know the fully edible thing so more pasta it was here we go alright so it's really worn here like I said so my modeling chocolate is pretty sticky that's why it looks so shiny but normally a room-temperature modeling chocolate is really solid so you really have to like give it a good meat but today it's nice and soft alright so to make these mushrooms we just go to a row a circle cut in half this will be the top cap of my button mushroom and then I'll make the little bottom pieces of the mushrooms just a little circles flattens out here so normally for a cake like this I would have all of these little decorative pieces created like a day or two in advance just so they all had time to dry and set up and then when it came time to assemble the cake the whole thing would be a lot easier so I'll just put this on I'll let this hang out for a second it'll kind of stick together I have some little brown cubes of modeling chocolate the same modeling chocolate that I used for my hamburgers and I'll paint these with the same piping gel vodka mixture so this is the meat or the protein on my skewer you know come to think of it this uh this girl cake actually is pre protein heavy and we have two cheeseburgers probably about 25 grams protein each and then you got these skewers so this is definitely it's definitely a well-rounded nutrition cake I would say all right let me just switch my gloves out here since I have that often lon clicking gel paint on top so if you guys want to share this video please share it you'll have on your Facebook wall forever if you want to you know try making this cake and if you do make this cake by all means absolutely please share it with me on my facebook page at 8 by dan I love when I you know I get the feedback that people of use tutorials to make cakes one of my favorite parts of the gig so it make these shrimp here really simply I'm just going to roll some really elongated teardrops pinch the end of one flat and then this is going to become the shrimp tail and it just needs a little bit of texture to it so I'll grab a modeling tool and kind of fan this out that will give it some shape and I'll kind of texture the back and underside of these doesn't have to be due to too detailed I'm going to dust these with a little bit of orange petal dust so I'll do that just on a napkin so I made a huge mess here so a little bit of orange petal dust tap it on the paper towel first and go in here so I know that shrimp especially once they're well once they're cooked are much darker that like peach orange on their tails and then that the color kind of fades up so I'll darken the tail a bit and then I'll bring the color kind of unevenly up them real quick here can also airbrush these that would be really cool and a little dark so maybe I'll use this other side here and then I'll kind of curl leaf okay so let's play some shrimp on the barbecue it's gotta fix this tail a little bit so modeling chocolate pieces are always easier to put on a cake once you chill them after shaping them because they'll set up really firm and then they'll go on your tank a lot smoother [Music] so time to put together the rest of these skewers I'm gonna grab two pieces of fettuccine certainly could use actual skewers here no real reason to make you know fake skewers especially since skewers or steamers but I just wanted to try and stick with as much edible stuff as I could so really simply I just have some red spheres of modeling chocolate that are kind of like cherry tomatoes one of my favorite vegetables to put on a kabob I have some strips of yellow fondant that I cut and textured to look like yellow peppers so you have my mushrooms here place those on there and then I'll go in with piece of beef prime cut of modeling chocolate beef right there a little slice of zucchini or summer squash whatever whatever you want to call it sometimes called cornea there you go in UK right mm-hmm Gareth is not okay don't quote me on that if you have any viewers from from the aforementioned places where they call summer squash what was that clear that right guys come let us know in the comments below and the next to this broadcast I'll check it out and I have learned something new all right so I'm just feeding these over the pieces of pasta and then whatever fun had gathered up on the edges of the pasta from the you know from the action of putting these on I'll just kind of clean that off I'll see which side looks best I kind of like that side here I'll shorten this a little bit so final touches going on here before I guess this whole thing together and you're going to grab a pastry brush just use that to dust off any of the less bits of this cornstarch great and like I said my favorite part of this cake is definitely the light up embers in the center so I really want to highlight those as part of the design and not cover them up so I'll place these just towards the edge here a little bit of cheese and you will be good to go so ningke's change my gloves again I don't get a bunch of colored dust on my modeling chocolate cheese I'll give this a good need I'll roll it out cut it out of the cutter and this cake will be good to go little dusting of cornstarch on top I really was going back and forth right away our cheddar cheese or this is white American look good go steal the white American cheese for my burgers so that's what I decided to go for it okay all right so I'll grab a square cutter once way too I'll make some hot corner slices to just make it look like one of these burgers has a heck of a lot of cheat line all right so I'll put that down there and I'll kind of pinch the edges of these slices so it looks like they're melting down hey other side nice place machines again so that's my version of a barbecue grill cake let's put the two side-by-side I have this barbecue grill right here on top of what I got some credible clicks in the yard you know just hanging out in the yard getting ready for Memorial Day and then I have this barbecue grill cake that is sitting in some sand on the beach because that's what I'll be doing next week at the beach grilling so I hope you guys enjoy seeing out and creating BBQ cakes you have any questions let me know in the comments below to my best answer the ones that I can see you guys next Friday night don't forget to check me out on Facebook at Beach High Dam and everybody have a great weekend I'll talk to you soon
[music playing] SKYLER BOUCHARD: So what is Jianbing? We think about it like a savory crepe wrap. It's super common in China. You'll find it on most street corners in the morning. So, a savory crepe wrap? Right. Break it down for me. It starts out looking like a crepe. We have a batter that's thicker than a crepe batter. SKYLER BOUCHARD: How did you guys learn how to make these? Neither of us has a formal training background. Reuben basically worked on this recipe while he was living in Shanghai. So how did Reuben and Tadesh become friends with jianbing and start Jianbing here? TADESH INAGAKI: Well, we started at Smorgasburg, which is a big outdoor food festival that happens every weekend in Williamsburg. People are kind of going there in part to explore new food. That was a year ago, SKYLER BOUCHARD: One year ago. TADESH INAGAKI: Yeah, almost exactly a year ago. REUBEN SHORSER: The story actually begins back in middle school when Tadesh and I met at band camp. We met in seventh grade. SKYLER BOUCHARD: --at band camp, wow. It's like a romantic-- REUBEN SHORSER: It's ridiculous SKYLER BOUCHARD: It's like how'd you meet your husband kind of story. REUBEN SHORSER: Yeah, it's-- What was that moment where you like, we have to do a business with this? I remember being in Shanghai, like thinking about this. And I was kind of tired of my job. And I wanted to do something else. I was working there at a consulting firm. And I was talking to Tadesh, and I was like, do to think that this is a crazy idea? Or should I actually move back, and are we going to do this? And he was like, seems like a normal idea. Let's just do it. That's what-- - It's pretty normal. - Yeah. TADESH INAGAKI: Let's do it. All right, so the dough is down and I crack an egg. What does the egg do for the dough here? For one, of course, it's about the flavor. It also kind of holds the whole thing together. Very crispy. Oh my gosh, that smells so good. Scallions? REUBEN SHORSER: Yep. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Cilantro. Lovely. What's this? REUBEN SHORSER: This here is a pickled mustard root. It's called zha cai in Chinese. It's kind of salty and a little bit sour. TADESH INAGAKI: OK, so we've got two different sauces. This we call 13 sauce. It's super unique. It's also got like orange peel, and ginger, and cloves. And this last piece is super important actually. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Is this what makes it a jianbing? TADESH INAGAKI: Yeah. This is actually a cracker that we make ourselves as well. It's kind of a labor of love because they're not that easy to make in large quantities. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Really? TADESH INAGAKI: It was really important to us from the beginning to make the original jianbing. And that's why every part of this we're making ourselves. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Wow. TADESH INAGAKI: And there you are. REUBEN SHORSER: There it is. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Look at that. That's gorgeous. Mmm, this is really good. TADESH INAGAKI: Awesome. REUBEN SHORSER: Awesome. Well, you guys know each other more than I know you both. So I'm going to switch it up a little bit and have you guys ask each other questions. What was the most unexpected thing about starting Jianbing Company? Oh, right. Honestly, I feel like it's the intensity of the work. Perhaps the most unexpected thing is how smoothly it's gone for us overall. For the past year it's gone almost like, I think, better than we expected. Right, yeah, yeah, well, let's-- So what advice would you give to anyone trying to start their-- any millennial trying to start a food business right now? To work with a partner, for sure. You know, if either-- if it was only either one of us doing this, we could not have done it. TADESH INAGAKI: Yeah. Yeah, you got to have two people. How do you like working with each other as friends? How do you maintain that balance? Yeah, it's definitely not-- it's not easy. No, it's not easy at all. And we've like-- we often say, so we've known each other for a super long time, including at school, but we've learned more about each other than we did during the extent of our friendship.

Hey. I'm Hannah. And welcome to "Feel Good" with me. Today we're going to make a super simple and delicious flourless chocolate mug cake. All you need is a mug and a few ingredients. [music playing] We're going to start with eggs. We're going to add all the wet ingredients together at once. I like to use maple syrup as a sweetener. But you can use honey or agave, whatever you may have in your kitchen. We're going to add a little bit of vanilla and coconut oil to keep everything really moist. And I think the hint of coconut really adds to the overall flavor of the cake. I'm going to whisk this all together. Coconut oil can be used as a makeup remover and it can also be used as a post-shower or bath moisturizer. And it even works as a conditioner for the ends of your hair. So now that that's done, I'm going to add the cocoa powder. And you want to make sure you mix this really well because you don't want any chunks in your final cake. And I really love this recipe because it's pretty easy. It only takes a few ingredients. My nephew absolutely loves it. He's seven. And he's always looking for a sweet fix. I make it for him all the time when he comes over. I'm also just going to add a pinch of salt because I think it really kind of balances out the bittersweet chocolate flavor. Now that this is all mixed up, I'm going to add my walnuts. Although you can use any nut that you really want. Pecans, almonds, kind of whatever you have available. I like to chop the walnuts really small because it acts as a substitute for the flour and binds the entire recipe. Now I'll just put these in here. And if you're a chocolate lover like me, I'll just add a few extra chocolate chips. Now that this is done, I'm going to add everything to my mug. OK. I like to put the mug on a plate. Just in case it spills over, you've got less of a mess, and you can clean it up off the plate and not the microwave. I'm going to put it in for about 80 seconds. But mind you, every microwave is different. This smells amazing. So you can really top this with anything. I like to do chopped fruit. Maybe some whipped cream or some more nuts. Shredded coconut. Whatever really your heart desires. But this looks gooey and awesome. Let's give it a little try. It's probably pretty hot. Mmm. Thanks for watching, guys. See you next week on "Feel Good" with me, Hannah.
hey everyone i'm chelsea white of cello suites and i'm here today to show you how to make a checkerboard cake so if you kind of match the chekura theme of black and white we're going to be flavoring this cake like cookies and cream some of you I haven't started off by showing them how we're gonna put together our layers so we can build this chick checkerboard pattern so as I'm doing this if you guys have any questions about me or baking or any of the techniques that I'm using feel free to ask so I have here 8 inch cake grounds I baked and I'm using some circle cutters to cut out 4 different pieces from each cake later and we're then going to alternate back inside of each it Oh pick up sorry we're then I'm gonna alternate them inside of each other so we can get that really fun pattern so I've already cut up two of my layers and you can see that I have started stacking them together so you're just gonna be alternating your white and your black paint layers so since I have a black layer here I'm gonna go ahead and take this white layer I'm gonna Nestle it in here and then we're gonna take our smallest little black circle and we're gonna put it right in the center so we're gonna go ahead we repeat this with all four of our cake layers umm and I'm gonna run you through some of the tips that I use to help make sure that this pattern turns out so I'm using here today my favorite vanilla cake base and my favorite layer chocolate cake recipe and both can be found on shell sweets calm so with that I'm gonna go ahead and assemble my second layer here so one important thing to note if you're making a checkerboard cake is to make sure that you do level your layers and normally with this recipe it bakes very flat so you don't normally have to level it but today since we really want all of our layers to be perfectly the same height that way our checkerboard is aligned it is important that you do later so keep that in mind if you are using this recipe or any other recipe that's a very important step so next not only to our layers complete have two layers I have a cut here and if you don't have these exact cake pans with this silence or okay sighs you can definitely alter this to use like a six inch cake ground if you had smaller circle cutters if the only thing that's important is that you're spacing between your rings it's equal and uniform so I'm gonna go ahead now and it's really easy I just like to make sure that it's lined up and you just gently press into the cake later so you want to press nice and firm and I like to kind of twist them a little bit just make sure that it's cut all the way through and then I just gently pull it out any questions out there while I'm doing this what's your favorite non cake dessert my favorite non cake dessert that's a tough one um I would have to say probably chocolate chip cookies so I like to cut out my cake grounds while my parchment paper still on there that's just my preference but you don't have to do that and then I just gently pop out each little bit and while you're doing this you want to be really careful because you don't want to tear your rings so my fingers are thoroughly chilled and that makes them a little bit easier to handle so I recommend doing that if you plan to cut out rings like this another thing is you also if you don't have um these circle cutters you can totally just alternate black and white and make a really fun pattern cake that way with a little bit less time cool but will still have a really great on interior once you cut into it so now we're just going to cover the last layer here and again you just want to really make sure that you're lining it up uniformly around your layer so let's put them together before I cut in just to make sure spacing is really even so we're just gonna gently push it in like this and also as you're doing this if for some reason you do get a lot of crumbs around your rings make sure that you clean them off so that way you don't get different colored crumbs all right so now it's time to assemble these last two layers and then we're gonna go ahead and get started assembling our cake I'm do the same thing as before I'm just going to gently remove these and this also takes up a lot of counter space to lay out all of your layers so make sure that you definitely let yourself enough room if you plan on doing this technique we're gonna go ahead and just keep alternating our leaders here and I'm gonna gently just push them together to make sure they're nicely lined this one here and then we just have the centers left so these should look exactly like bull's-eyes once you're done with them I'm gonna go ahead and make sure there's an excellent level I'm gonna go ahead and dust off my hands and and we're going to go ahead and get stocking so I'm going to go ahead and slide this over here and I'm going to Center my cake stance you guys can see exactly what I'm doing so we're going to stack these and we're going to be frosting it with a little bit of American buttercream that I made and this is just standard vanilla buttercream so my layer cakes I like to put a little bit of buttercream on my cake base and just spread it out and then I really help secure your cake to your cake base sometimes you get a little bit of slippage and I can help control that so we're going to go ahead and start I think with this layer you can go ahead and center it and as you're doing this to get the checkerboard it's important that you alternate your outside layers so next we'll stack a vanilla layer that has been all on the outside rim so I'm going to go ahead and put on a decent amount of buttercream here and I like to add a lot of buttercream to my cakes they're like a huge sweet tooth so if you don't like this much butter cream it's all about your preference you can definitely put less on and also if you don't love American buttercream you can totally use a different type like Swiss meringue or Italian any of that would work on this cake do you ever use chocolate buttercream and cinnamon on I do actually so today when our finished decorating this I would be adding a little bit of butter or chocolate buttercream to the top to decorate so yes and we will be today somebody gently spread this out and since we did level our key players if you have some loose crumbs so it's really important as you're doing this gently birthday frosting to the edge of a cake layer so you don't rip up a bunch of those crumbs go ahead just keep working my way out here and then we're going to smooth it any other questions how do you make the buttercream so this buttercream I love American buttercream for the taste but it also is the easiest buttercream to me all you do is you take butter sugar and vanilla you mix them together you very slowly incorporate powdered sugar and then you add in splashes of cream so literally five ingredients super easy my recipe for American buttercream is at lunch Elsa's calm and actually a full tutorial as well on my youtube channel which is called shell sweets bakery so you haven't any questions on how to make it definitely head over there and check that out I'm going to go ahead now just spin this around get nice and level buttercream and that's for not an ex-gay clear so like I said earlier we're going to be using this later next and it's important to make sure that your layers are pretty aligned as you're doing this because you want them to line up when we cut into this it's next to I have now it's more oh I forgot to add our our crepes or a lot of them to our next layer so I'm going to add some more butter cream on top of this and we're going to smooth it as well so again we're just using the same technique here and if you don't have an office especially you can always use a knife um but it also special makes a lot easier so if you have one definitely use it and if you don't but you like decorating cakes a lot I highly recommend getting one these two tools are the most used tools in my entire time so I hope you don't mind getting them if you don't have it and you like to be okay so we're gonna add some chopped or some chopped chocolate sandwich cookies at this layer and this is just going to give it a little bit of an extra crunch as we bite in so I always like a little texture in my case so but if you don't like chocolate sandwich cookies or you are not a big texter person so next we're going to use a layer that has black on the outside so I go ahead and set this down and we're gonna run the press down just make sure that we have all this orbit was secured underneath it's pretty good we're gonna have some more buttercream any other questions out there yes do you chill your buttercream first no I don't um I guess if I were to make it ahead of time and stored overnight I would pop it into the fridge but in general I usually on whip up buttercream and then use it immediately and I don't chill it so if you have any problems with your buttercream being too thin and you are struggling to frost smoothly on you can always that a little bit less heavy cream or a little bit more powdered sugar either those will help stiffen up your buttercream as well where can you buy the rings that you use to cut the wires so I bought my rings on Amazon I literally just searched circle cookie cutters or circle cutters and they popped up which was great but I'm really sure you can also find them at cake decorating stores are probably even on some water to retail stores like Walmart or Target and then we're gonna add our last layer so we're almost done stacking I'm so excited to cut into this cakes that's the very best part so this is definitely in be a delayed gratification type of a cake so last but not least around our last cake layer here and again when you're handling these layers you have to be very careful because you know it's four individual pieces of cake and you don't want to show you all stay together so be very delicate as we're doing this so now that my cake layer is on edit to flip it upside down because it makes it easier to get a nice sharp edge just when your frosting and that's because you know that the bottom and the sides are the key player base against the pan so they're guaranteed to be flat so anyway I have now just press this down make sure you don't have any air bubbles in here and to make sure all my layers are nicely aligned and once we've done that we're gonna go ahead and start to frost the exterior of the cake now in a perfect world I would definitely apply a crumb coat to this cake chill it and then apply a nice second layer of buttercream especially since we have our use matte dark cake base which is going to release some dark crumbs but today since this is a live stream we're just gonna be doing one coat of frosting however if you have unloaded time I highly recommend using and crumb coat but it's always the best practice so now I'm going to go ahead and smooth this out on the top and then we're gonna work our way down our size it's gonna make sure this is nice in the line alright so you don't have to cross this way this is just the way that I find is easiest I just kind of push my cross into the edge and then work my sighs but I think a lot of people have different techniques for this so if you do it a different way that's great but I find that this works best for me we're going to smooth it out and so once we have all the Frost's do you want to hear we're actually going to be covering this cake with crushed Oreos so if that's going to be great because that way if we do get any extra crumbs on the edge of our cake or any of our Oreos are peeking through it filled the cake with it's not gonna be a big deal and they won't really show up so we're just gonna make sure we get a nice even layer of frosting here and then we're gonna go ahead and get stuck hoping this in crushed chocolate sandwich cookies all right so we're gonna go ahead and smooth across it now around and out a little bit more in a minute but first I'm just gonna try to shop in all those crumbs again if you don't love a lot of frosting you can totally you can even do this as a naked cake where you just leave the edges exposed or you can do it really like frosting where there are some bits of exposed cake it really all comes down to your preference so I'm gonna go ahead and add a little bit more on here because that's how I like my cakes and I'm just gonna share this cake with my friends that are helping me tonight which are Julie and Lauren and they also like frosting the hawk so we're going to add a watch this any other questions out there for people just tuning in you just go through what cake you're making of course so I'm making today a checkerboard cake and it is going to be a cookies and cream flavored cake and we're going to be covering it in a minute with crushed Oreos and we have made some rings with our cake layers we're going to make a really beautiful pattern when we cut into it so now that I have frosted our cake and we have a decent amount of frosting on here we're gonna go ahead a little bit just make your edges a bit sharper and then we're going to add some crushed Oreos so I'm gonna go ahead and just kind of apply an even amount of pressure here and drag my cake bench around and this is just to really smooth out those sides and again this isn't going to be perfect but it's not a big deal because we're going to be covering our cake and crushed Oreos in one minute so if you have a hard time getting perfectly smooth sides on your cake a really great technique that you can use is covering your cake and either sprinkles crushed Oreos anything like that even crushed graham crackers and that can help kind of cover those imperfections and still make your cake look really great and give it a great pop of flavor as well so that's a great trick to use if you're working on learning how to perfectly smooth frosting I have a full in-depth tutorial in which I take you through all the tips that I use get perfectly smooth sides so you can download out my youtube channel which is called shell sweets bakery if you want to learn more about that so I'm gonna go ahead now just add a little bit more frosting up here a little bit and then we're gonna smooth out the top and then we're gonna smooth it one more time any other questions people are very excited for you to cut into the cake I know it's gonna be the best part I'm already excited but I'm trying to like control myself as we finish decorating this cake that's the thing also so like I'm gonna rush through frosting right now but I swear I could spend all day smoothing a cake I think that a lot of Baker's out there are also perfectionist and so it's so hard to just hurry through these steps but most quickly as I can as we get to the best part as soon as possible it keeps moving and again you have the recipes for everything that I am making share at lunch all sweets calm and if you're enjoying this and you want to see more of my cake tutorials you can always check out my youtube channel which is called shell sweets bakery alright I think we're just about as smooth as we're gonna get with one coat of frosting so that's great you can see we do have a little bit of cake poking through but it's not a big deal because we're about to come in this in crushed chocolate sandwich cookies so I'm gonna go ahead and slide these over and I'm gonna get out a large baking tray and whenever you're covering up meat and I think it's always great to set it in a baking tray so that way and run away sprinkles on our trapped if you don't do this to end up with sprinkles all over your floor or um crushed cookies so I highly recommend this step I've learned that the hard way I think last time in your life for examples I also box rumbles everywhere like my feet we're just crushing them okay so I excused my hands and gently press crushed Oreos all around this cake and again I'm just making this cake for me and my friends tonight and I clearly wash my hands so I was gonna use them so anyway I can grab a handful here and I'm just going to very gently press it up and it's important here to apply enough pressure so that you're going to adhere the cookies to the side of the cake but not so much here as much your frosting so it's definitely a delicate kind of touch but you need it to be somewhat firm so be careful as you do this to be a comfortable with you my own pressure that you believe you need to apply the other questions other how many layers are under there so in this case there are four layers which is going to give it that really awesome pattern when you cut into it and it's just a vanilla and chocolate cake base that I've used to make that pattern and what size hands did you use to make the layers so these are 8-inch cake layers but you don't have to use that size if you have different size cake pans you can totally make this pattern out of AA different sized cake layers and veterans is covering this and just kind of gently turn it as we go so you guys can see the progress that we're making this have no idea how much willpower it took not to eat all of the chocolate sandwich cookies while I was chopping them I did taste test a little bit group but there still should be enough respect so I've been doing this you easier tons of extra rock on the sides and I likes gonna scoop that up and utilize it as I work my way around the cake so we're almost anything for about three quarters the way great any other questions where people find the recipe so again in this recipe you guys if you want to make it for the cake layers the buttercream everything is up on shell sweets calm and also I have tutorials for everything if you want to see exactly how I make this cake batter that can also be found on my youtube channel which is called Chelsea bakery [Music] I have a lot of leftover sandwich cookies so I think that we'll be able to take care of those later who gives you this right all right so once I covered the cake I would like to just kind of gently press in with my hands and that's gonna help secure any piece that might be a little bit loose or might not be fully effective cake all right so that's pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead now I just scrape away the excess around the base of my fingers because we don't want this falling all over the place when we move it us back onto our cakes and there's a lot of loose bits at the bottom here so obviously go ahead all right that's pretty good so now we're going to ahead and generally lift this up see if I can flip it I might use my offset spatula just to be safe there we go we're gonna mend places back onto our cake stand I'm also gonna rinse off my hands away quickly just because they have all right and now we're gonna go ahead and decorate the top of this cake so to make this a little bit fun I have some extra sandwich cookies here and we're gonna find this place these and a ring around the top so I'm gonna go ahead nothing is broken so I've made a lot of cookies and cream cakes in my day and I wanted to do something a little bit different today so I'm mixing up the pattern so we're gonna go ahead and keep working our way around here so once all of these sandwich cookies are in place we are going to be piping on some chocolate swirls on top of them which should be really fun and then we're gonna go ahead and slice into it which is the moment we've all been waiting for am i right am i right you are right okay so I have here some chocolate buttercream that a place into a bag and I'm using the Wilton 2d tip and on this chocolate buttercream is just the same buttercream you used for the vanilla to cover the cake but it on a little bit of baking cocoa to it and just a splash of extra cream to help counteract the cocoa because it helped it cut it ends up the buttercream we're gonna go ahead and now just pipe on some really fun swirls and if you don't have a Wilton 2d dip you can definitely use whatever ticket on my hand I think a Wilton 1m is also very common I think a lot of people have that so you can use whatever you think will look best how long does it take like this last after it's completed I'm also good for you know I haven't ever really had kicked it out for that long so I don't think I really know and it depends on how you store it but I think if you put it in the freezer what we could last for let's say like up to a week but I think that the sooner you eat it after you bake it the better the fresher it is all right you guys and just like that our cookies and cream checkerboard cake is complete so times the best part now which is pointy this case I'm gonna go ahead and set these to the side and wring their out our giant plate and their giant knife we always use think yeah I might come around to the other side because I think that that might be easiest for them to see : so I can show it to you hopefully okay so here we go you guys in this a really big slice because I'm sharing it with my friends we also with the Oreos you kind of have to cut paper one inch slices or two inch slices so kind of regulates how big of a slice and slice but all right you guys let's see how it's turned out so we have a really fun checkerboard pattern I'm going to set this down slide that over means your frosting is a little bit smeared but overall it's a really fun pattern that we have there and see how easy it is to put together and checkerboard cake so on again if you guys want to see a full tutorial for this which is a little bit more detailed and I'm able to take my time a little bit more able full tutorial up on my youtube channel which is called Chelsea's

see you guys hopefully next week
what's up guys welcome back to my Bake Shop I'm Dan Landon from baked bread and tonight I'm creating another crazy gigantic food cake so huge watermelon shootable are now in place watermelon are one of my favorite foods to eat or fruits rather I should say this I'm here to write it started we have Anthony on camera we have Caitlyn answering questions and course I'm Dan let's do this so I'm going to move this huge watermelon cake that I've already made out of the way here but first I'll give you guys a little peek of what's to come move this out of the way you're probably wondering how I arrived at the shape don't wear much I guess so what I have here is a pound cake it's nice and cold I took it out of the fridge what I did was bake one 10 inch cake layer cut in half and I sandwiched it together and then I cut a flat side here so that it would stand up flat just like that but to get the water down shape what I want to do is take a serrated knife and just little by little leave the bottom of the cake wide and towards the top of the cake just taper it up so this will give me that classic you know watermelon slice shape down looking for so for cakes like this they're sculpted and kind of defy gravity and bow out a little bit like this cake does I really like to use a butter cake or a pound cake there's something that's nice and sturdy so that you know when it's standing up it stays Danielle and I also really like to use ganache too if you guys to watch me a design cakes before you've probably heard me talk about ganache it's basically just a mixture of chocolate and heavy cream and you mix the two together and it makes this really strong filling or frosting that's solid room temperature so just with my serrated knife here I'm just going to keep tapering this in and eventually I'll arrive at this tapered watermelon shape just like that so I could be just like that or I could continue to taper it up but it's pretty simple pretty easy whenever you're sculpting a cake if the cake is cold it will be a lot easier and if you're nice to get a lot of cake or buttercream or whatever stuck to it you just want to wash it off with some hot water and it'll be easy-peasy so that is how I created this shape let me just get this out of the way and we started with the actual decoration of this one right here so the first thing I have to do is roll out some white fondant and that's cuz I'm going to start this entire watermelon white and then paint the red paint the pink part rather so I'll start with some white fondant here and I actually microwaved it a couple minutes ago sort of the planks of warm flexible and I'll grab just a little bit of vegetable shortening put that in my hand and give this an ease don't forget to do that to have questions about what I'm doing here your questions about baking your tapes I'll leave your questions in the comments below I'll do my best to answer them and don't forget to share this video with your friends if you think they'd enjoy it and check out my facebook page at base button the links should be at the top of this video so I just want to knead this white fondant just until it's nice and stretchy nice and flexible people always ask me why your fondant cracks and sometimes unfortunately fondant does just crap but usually I find that it cracks because the fun that's dried out where you didn't need it long enough so a good test is always to see if your father's a nice and stretchy when you're kneading it and if it is it should be stretching when it goes on the cake I want to grab just a little bit more just for insurance I have enough that's another trick with phonics you always want to work with a little more than you think you need because the excess that hangs off the cakes makes putting the fondant on the cake a lot easier it's really helpful so this cake will be awesome for you know summer barbecue a block party you cook out and then whatever you want to take it to and I actually started to water modes that are when you decorating here with 12-inch cakes so I would get them you know not large all right so I want to roll all of the wrinkles back so they have nice smooth top grab some cornstarch and my shaker here get a good bit on the table and I want to roll out pretty large piece I'll give it a good pat down with my hands a little bit more cornstarch on top grab a good old PVC rolling pin start over so every couple rolls I like to turn my on it just so it stays circular and save nice interior as well and as I go along with I see any huge air bubbles I'll just give them a pop with a little pin I just know that this Navy shirt ain't going to end up covered with Coon starts by the time I'm done this but you know price you pay for making awesome cake so I'll roll this until it's about a little maybe an eighth of an inch thick maybe a little bit thicker I'll be alright - so I'll grab a pin just to pop use you can zoom in on some of this stuff it yeah Nicolette wants to know how do you keep layer cakes fresh and moist process hey Nicolette you know that is a great question some people like to use simple syrups to keep their cakes fresh moist I don't usually I think the best trick is just to work quickly so bake your cake wrap it up as soon as it's cool and then fill in frost it as soon as you can if you're going to leave a cake in the refrigerator overnight you definitely want it to be at least at the crumb coat stage so it's nice an airtight so anytime you put a cake in the fridge you want it to be frosted with some type of you know crumb coat ganache or buttercream so that's airtight if you need to store your cakes for longer before filling and frosting them wrapping them a couple times and then freezing them is actually a really good process or a really good really good thing to do I should say alright so just using this out my fine Rivard I'm gonna grab my cake so this cake is ganache this is the beauty of ganache I can like handle it and hold this and really really kind of hit it with some good force while I'm decorating it and it's not going to go anywhere so what I want to do kind of wait for my work service is just miss my cake with some vodka and you guys know I really like to use vodka for cake decorating cuz it dry so quickly so sometimes when attaching fot it to a ganache cake I like to use vegetable shortening but the box is going to give an extra hold for this cake so basically I'm doing is placing one side of the cake down and then I'm just going to grab this white fondant and just wrap it up just like that super easy around my fondant smoother smooth this whole thing on here until like I said I have a good bit of excess and that's perfect it's always better to have more and be able to cut the fondant away than it is to throw it out be like oh no I don't have not so I'll give this to good smooth from the middle out that's going to push out any air bubbles if I do see some air bubbles of trapped between the cake and the fondant I'll just give them as smooth if you guys are just joining we are creating this gigantic watermelon cake just in time for all the summer barbecue Sofia wants the Nelson taste the vodka that you can trade on the page shit no you totally don't taste the vodka it completely evaporates so I'm going to still be there don't worry so I'm just going to take a craft knife now and what I want to do is just cut this spot it away right where this rounded area ends so I'll start by cutting a lot of excess away so I can see how to see what I'm working with now put this away for later use can always reuse funny you're going get rid of it as long as you put it back in this bag right away it will stay good alright so now I can kind of see the edge of this cake and I'm just going to use my knife and just carefully wrote a knife along the edge of the cake and hopefully get a nice flush cut if not I can go back in and do another another pass with my craft knife so this is kind of like I guess paddling the cake because of the shape of this watermelon covering it in a traditional manner really wouldn't work well so I find that this is easiest methods what I want to do here is just take my fingers just smoothy's together I want the fondant to become pretty well attached to the ganache cake and then what I'm going to do is just take this off clear myself a little bit of space here for somebody with an alcohol if you guys don't use alcohol you could to these water that would work just fine alright so when I go back here to want it yeah alright so I'm going to pick right here is good yeah I'm going to pick my cake up take my board and a piece of parchment and just flip the cake over because I need to get the other side and you be able to cut the other side so I feel a little air bubble I'll push that out the side here so right now Pennsylvania it's a good two solid 75 degrees which makes cake decorating even in a sea kind of difficult on another advantage of using ganache is that ganache like you guys saw is pretty solid room temperature whereas buttercream is not sovereign temperature really softens up so if you're having issues with your cakes feeling too soft when you're trying to butter cream or carbon in fondant and you've used buttercream try switching to ganache and you might find that it's a lot easier so if you guys want the recipe for the cakes that I'm using you can check out my blog which is baking with Dan comm also checking out my Instagram it baked by Dan on its ear and because I usually post a lot of cool stories and pictures of what I'm doing for these lives so if you guys want to be in the know for the time comes you can check it out there all right so I'm just doing a couple final cuts here to get all of this white off and get it where I need to be smooth this with my finger good all right so before divine want to take stationed rush just get rid of any of this extra corn search yeah Sarla would like to know what exactly is phenom Darla ganache is what is on the inside of a truffle it's a mixture of chocolate and heavy cream I like to use white chocolate ganache because it's not going to show through like chocolate or dark chocolate would so to make white chocolate ganache you're going to need a scale the recipe is by weight and I 5 parts by weight of white chocolate and then in one part by weight of heavy cream or whipping cream double cream and a cream that has at least like 35 percent butterfat in it will work so now I'm going to roll out some green fondant and that's going to be the green skin in this watermelon so let's move that away in grandma green so I studied a watermelon pretty close to you're ready for this cake is that it's really funny whenever I make fruitcakes I always spending a bit of time splitting the fruit or vegetable but I'm turning into food and basically what I notice is that the two colors in the watermelon are basically just two saturations of green so what I want to do is start the cake with the lightest green which is kind of this lime green here and then I'll build up the color using like a sponge painting method so I want to give this a good roll same thing I want to nice and stretchy we'll grab a little bit shortening so if you guys are just joining we are creating this epic sculpted worm just in time for all those summer festivities and what I'm doing now is meeting the green fondant for the skin of work Jennifer is asking how you go about keeping the key good if you say do it before you need it Jennifer if you're going to make a cake a week before unit you definitely want to double or triple wrap it into some type of plastic wrap and then put it in your freezer and it should be done and then you can just defrost it before you want to fill it or frost it alright so same thing I want to roll out the three here I'm gonna grab my cornstarch even more on the table as if I don't already have enough cornstarch on the table on me let's hit some more here so I'll roll this to the width I need it about eight inches and then prepare just going to roll it long way around if you find that your fondant sticks a lot when you're rolling it it's really helpful to always keep the fun that moving if you're always shifting around and keeping it moving it's less likely to stick and if it is sticking you'll catch it you'll catch it earlier than you would if you just kept going and then if you need to start over you can start over quicker I don't think you know alright so I'm just popping these air bubbles and what's really great here about the scandal or doll is that the fondant doesn't have to be perfectly smooth it has some denser you know craters in it no big deal because I've never seen a perfect watermelon I hope take day they exist so any kind of imperfections or textured textured elements are just going to add to the look of the cake once it's finished all right good so my rolling pins 20 inches long so I know that I have enough fun and I'll just roll this up on a rolling pin brush off some of this cornstarch here turn the 5/8 I'm not my cake again I have sitting on a piece of parchment and I was given mist with more vodka so that my sonnet six and on the bottom of the cake I have attached a piece of foam core board that's what cake is standing up on so I don't want that to be too sticky because I'm gonna peel it away from that so I'm just making sure that the edges of this white fondant that I apply it earlier making sure they're sticky because I want the green and the white to adhere to each other a lot of times with sculpted cakes people have issues with trying to get their ganache or their buttercream smooth because they're using a palette knife which is straight but obviously your cakes aren't straight or curved you can either piece of plastic acetate to smooth it you can also just buff it with some water and your hands once the butter cream or ganache is set up all right so you see I just unrolled that right over the watermelon and now basically I'm just going to use my hands and get to smoothing this in here so I'll do the same thing I'll cut this upper side and then I'll flip the cake over to cut the other side but I'm pushing specifically right along the edge here because I want to get the green fondant that's the skin of the watermelon and the white area I want them to be attached really well and if I want to buff this out I'll take a little extra piece of this bonnet you guys need to see me do this trick before and I'll just rub the Sonic along the cake and this will just make sure it's attached adhered I know I just said the skin doesn't have to be perfectly smooth but it's not just about smoothing but it's also about making sure that the fondant stuck to the cake really well that's real important go so now what I'll do is grab a knife here and cut away a lot of this excess so guys don't forget to post your questions in the comments below share this video if you guys have ever created a close to cake or into the case you want to share share it in the comments below so we can all check it out so now what I want to do is place the flat part of my knife just go ball in the cake I'll start at the middle here make sure you guys can see this and if I run this along the area that I already covered and try and keep them legs nice and steady I should get a nice clean cut yeah breezy wants to know if you have to create the cake after you do the ganache brandy you don't have to freeze the cake you can just put it in the refrigerator if you're going to cover a cake in fondant once it's once it's covered in buttercream or ganache usually you don't want to freeze it at that point because when you take it out of the freezer it's going to get a ton of condensation on it and then it's going to make it really tough to cut your cake because your fondant will basically you wet the whole time you're trying to smooth it all right so just a couple more cuts here I just want this to be a nice clean edge and after we get this on here I'm going to be painting this and want to show you have to Cole cool sponge painting techniques using a sea sponge and a piece of plastic wrap to get a really cool texture that I think looks pretty realistic so I'll just smooth this with my pointer finger and some make sure it's nice an attached and I'm gonna be flipping this cake over I'm just going to cut away a little bit of extra I don't want to cut all the way up against the cake cause they get a little bit of overhang so all right so same thing I'll smooth this side over make sure to attach the white and green really nicely if they don't feel like they're attaching what I want to do is to take a paintbrush with a little bit of vodka and just brush that on there good when I smooth my hands so we'll find that smoother for this part since its rounded one really be too helpful so my hands are my best tool here is I can kind of confirm them to the cake clean off my knife just so I can get a nice clean cut I always like to use the part of the knife to that's closest to the handle I find that that's usually sharper since you know for everyday cutting you don't really use the inside of the mix so that works really well for process like this good switch back to my craft knife here for these final two cuts and then we'll be good to go this is this watermelon cake will be ready to paint which i think is a really fun part of the whole project good are you so tell people are ask me if you kind of back up and you crazy box on the cake why'd you do that yeah guys so I sprayed back on the cake just so that the just of the fondant would stick to the ganache that's what I did I like to spray either butter cream cakes or ganache cakes with vodka if I'm going to cover them in fondant just because the vodka dries pretty quickly so I find that I get a good good contact between the cake in the pocket it is here's pretty quickly all right so one more final cut it's all about the details here so something like this you definitely don't want to rush through all right now take my pointer finger my thumb again smoother this all together we have some good contact and now I just need to cut off this piece of fondant it's on the bottom so I'll go back to my knife here I'll kind of find where that cardboard is and just start carefully cutting away so this us that is pretty important because this obviously becomes the base of the cake what the cakes going to sit on so I have to make sure that it has a good sturdy base whenever I'm creating a slope to kink I always like to kind of overcompensate with the structure it's always I think a little bit easier to over the infrastructure or over plan than it is to kind of underestimate how strong the cake Marian update Ryan with right - no Brian yeah no type of paint you use when you're PPP Brian so it's actually not paint it's just food coloring it's the same food color that you use to color fondant or buttercream and I just mix it again with vodka because it drives so quickly so it's not going to make your fondant really sticky and gummy like water would Alden cookies water alright so now I have the cardboard exposed here and what I want to do is grab my paint so I have some Moss color food coloring I have some vodka and I have a little natural sea sponge so the first thing I want to do is take some of my less saturated green and I'm going to sponge paint all over the entire thing this is going to get any kind of that uneven light green speckle that you see on the watermelon I want to try and make sure I don't get any on the white section lock it down so I want this to be pretty regular it doesn't have to be perfect good and then what I want to do is go back with the same green but in a more saturated tone so we'll get this later green out of the way and I have some full strength moss green food gel here I'll add some vodka to my plate and I want a nice dark green so I'll just have this sponge in here and I'll start with one line straight down the middle gut so that's my first line I'll do the same thing I'll continue that over on the other side let me actually move myself here so you guys probably see me a little better back with my darker green good and then I'm going to take a tape brush and just speckle the inside of this dark green strip to some little more more dark green good so if you guys are just tuning in we're about a halfway through making this giant sculpted watermelon cake I'm painting the fondant right now to look like watermelon skin so I'm using a sea sponge and some Moss colored green food coloring I'm going to get a close-up here I'll show you guys again how I did it I'll go up all the way towards the edge just gonna sponge paint this on and then what it kind of starts to meet this top point I'll stop so you can find these sea sponges in the craft section of the craft store they're always sanitized when you buy them but of course you can just clean them with you know sanitizer hot soap and water and you can use them for cake decorating so I'll go back with my paintbrush a little bit of a darker green just in random spots good and then I just want to do one more pass here right towards the bottom so guys don't forget to ask your questions in the comments below and Caitlyn will let me know what your questions are and so if you guys if you have questions about anything baking related cakes pastry you know whatever you guys want to know get me the comics we'll see if we can answer them alright one more time a little bit of green on the brush and then what we're going to do is grab a piece of plastic wrap and I just kind of have punched out and then I'll go back down the middle of each of these stripes on the skin here to kind of blend in this darker green areas this is actually one of my favorite painting texturing techniques is using this plastic wrap because it works so easy you can also do this to texture buttercream it's really cool do you guys like these cakes tutorials and you know baking and decorating things check out my youtube channel my youtube is baking what down YouTube you can also just find some of those videos on my facebook page which is baked by dan on Facebook alright so now the green is pretty much done so I'll clear this green out of the way but any tips for making found on teas taste good there guys you know what if you're going to make funded from scratch usually the best tasting thing you can find is marshmallow fondant and you can also flavor fun with whatever you want you can add extracts to it you can emulsions to it whatever you want to do but I find that a little bit of salt and some vanilla extract into a marshmallow fondant makes it taste pretty good just as it is so I'm just cleaning up my cornstarch here alright so let me grab my turntable good try and center that awesome all right so let me just change my gloves here get rid of it three through diet it's always in my club so if you guys have an idea for a hate project that you would like to see whether it's a sculpted cake or giant food cake whatever you may want to see let us know in the comments below we're always looking for ideas for the next Facebook live and take it for me any time you're painting a cake with your color or your coloring fondant it's always really helpful wear gloves because your fingers end up watermelon green I'll probably be like after a couple days so alright so the next thing I want to do is grab some green tights and I want to kind of blend this really harsh green line between the skin and the white pulp together so I'm just going to take a little bit of green petal dust tap some into the cap here and I'm just really going to lightly just brush over the spot where the two meet so where the green and the white meets I'm just going to brush with a little bit as green petal dust and that kind of that makes it a little bit less of a harsh transition so if you can find these powdered food colors in most arts and crafts stores that sell cake decorating supplies so if you just go to cake decorating aisle you can find this stuff okay so some people are asking I don't know if you know the answer to this is it's safe for children to eat just yeah I would say yes definitely the vodka evaporates if you don't believe me you can pour a little bit of vodka into a plate and walk away for a couple minutes and come back in it'll already started evaporating um but like I said if you don't want to use the vodka that's just my medium of choice you can use water or you can use piping gel or you can use a mixture of water and corn syrup you could use simple syrup in a spray bottle anything that's going to make the surface of your cake kind of damp and sticky will work well to attach fondant to a cake so I already just run the parts we already have a little bit of texture on this white area which is perfect the most challenging part for me I'm making this cake was just trying to get the the red pulpy part of the watermelon to look realistic because it's just such a such a deep colored and textured aspect of the watermelon is pretty challenging to replicate in cake but I'm pretty happy with how my finished product turned out again looks pretty nice alright so I'll put this green food color away and now what I need to do is paint on the the red section of the cake so I'm going to get my green fondant back out I want to roll it out so to paint the red on the cake out of basically thinking like how do I paint this red and get a nice clean line and I was like well you know we're going to paint my house I'm going to tape off the walls right here I'm going to tape the corners when I'm going to pee in the house but I will say I'm not going to put tape on a cake so what I'm going to do is stick a fondant shirt to it paint the red section of the watermelon and peel the fondant off and I'll have a nice clean line so basically that's what I'm doing here I'll roll this out one more time smaller going pins left and then I'm just going to use a shirt cutter to cut a strip of green fun and I want to stick this trip to the Cape just using a little bit of vegetable shortening the shortening will hold the shirt in place long enough for me to paint right into paint but that'll be able to seal it off alright okay so strip cutter people call these shirt cutters ribbon cutters they're delighted for names words you can find them online or at cake decorating stores basically I'll just pass this all the way down the strip doesn't need to be perfect doesn't have to be any even thickness I'm basically using it to act as a guide for my painting right so a little bit of vegetable shortening I'll rub this on here so that it is nice and sticky this is like the homestretch of this cake guys so if you're watching don't go anywhere because once this rent comes on this cake completely comes together and I think it's the most most epic summer cake that I'll probably create all week I'll make another one next week all right so just rubbing this shortening on here good so what I'm going to do now is Center my cake back on the table and just pick up these strips here and just stick it to the side of the cake so I'm trying to line up the edge of this strip with the edge of the skin that I created earlier just pinch this off so I'll just push this in place to make sure it's here good and then I'll grab my knife I'll just cut this flat all right oh it's like I said this is my technique for basically taping off the watermelon so I can get that red section there so to paint my cake I'm about to use a mixture of pink and red I tried this out a few times on a swatch the pink wishes to brighten the red almost was kind of too deep so I found that a mixture of pink and red food dye worked best for well messes to do next I have that mixture in a custard cup here it's a little bit of food dye with some vodka and then before I go on I just want to look down at this and just make sure that evenly attached that there's no spaces because I don't want the red to drip down I'm doing this so that I have nice white outline after I finish painting my red one here all right so I'm going to take a modeling tool and just give this a little bit of texture just kind of Nick it up a little bit because watermelons always have that really porous spongy looking kind of effect to them and then whenever I thought of watermelon never really sharp at the top it's always kind of denting and spongy edges that looks just so softly kind of irresistible you just on a plate into it because you just know to be juicy so I'll roll around the tool in a couple of areas just to insinuate where seeds will end up so I'm doing this texturing before I paint it obviously well allow the paint to gather in those areas it'll look a little fuller I think once it's done I want to get some more plastic wrap ready and I'm going to grab a paper house in case I need it and then starting at the top just cluster our paint mossad went out a little more vodka to it next time I make this cake I think what I'm going to do is especially buy some watermelon vodka so every time vodka for the project it's just going to fit my two issues the peanuts and putting in these not mine so I chose to paint this that's a good question because I can kind of manipulate the paint once it's all on there and give it a look of texture if I just put fondant on it it would just be really solid and it wouldn't have as much life to it I don't think so and for things like this I really like using a fan brush because I think it gives really a quick coverage so any areas really pull up towards the bottom definitely want to get rid of that right away so that it doesn't kind of drip down under my strip here all right subject but I go in with some more plastic wrap here just kind of hit this up and like a sweeping motion our young million-dollar question was able to do the math this is actually a red velvet cake I thought about making a vanilla cake and dyeing it pink but I'm a big chocolate fan so I always sneak some chocolate and stuff whenever I can and once it's live is over the crew and I are you enjoying this cake so I figured you guys will pay for it so oh yeah oh yeah yeah all right so so going in with this painting here so whatever I'm paying a cake like this and I mix the color up I wanted to do a swatch first so before this live I actually mixed this paint up and I painted it on a little bit of white on it just to see what it would look like because it would really stink to have this whole cake you know put together and then put the paint on there and completely heated so it's always a good idea to do a test first so for my seeds I'm just going to take some little black pieces of fondant and roll them out and stick them in some of these groups that I made all right backing with my plastic wrap give us a little bit of DAB here so whenever you're doing this technique you always kind of to change the area you're using because once it gets really loaded up with color it doesn't work as well so I think the polls look a little bit better than dabbing it and then once it starts to dry if you kind of go back and texture it the colors a little more therapy it's a little bit thicker so it kind of pulls a little bit nicer and I think you get even more texture out of it good all right so I'll let that set for just a second you know the red dye up so now what I want to do is just grab just a little bit of fondant just going to roll out some seeds for this watermelon so I know that some watermelons have like white seeds or tan seeds and some have black seeds but I wanted to see two really uh really contrasting on location but I decided to go with black so I'll just roll some circles with a fondant actually going to continue a blowback for this because it's impossible to do this glove so let that dry for just a moment longer so little bits of black fondant just roll the circles in my hands point the bottom and then just let them dry for just a second good so a cake like this when it's done I would keep it in a refrigerator until I wanted to serve it just for just for insurance if I was going to travel with this cake I definitely would keep it chilled until I was ready to leave if you chill your cake and then you keep your cake in a brown cardboard shipping box that is specifically for cakes it will kind of insulate the cake and it will be a little more insurance that your tape will travel and still be in one piece and get wherever you're going all right so time for the magic here let's peel this green strip off see what we have big reveal place extreme keeping cool there we go look I'll take a little bit of hand-colored fun a little bit of brown and I'll need it just into a circle just like this right here and then I'll take a texturing tool just texture that a little bit and I'm going to stick this to one side of the watermelon I think this side look is good press today with my fingers this is kind of like a little nub for the watermelon groves they're like the bellybutton I like to call it a bellybutton awesome alright let's stick some seeds in here to do that I'm going to grab my wooden sculpting tool and I'm just going to use the rounded edge of the window angel and push in a little bit with a point up and then I'll take my seeds and push those in point out how she wants to know when you paint the cake yeah does the color deepen as it's done or is a pretty true color when you first do it uh Tasha I actually find that the color kind of lightens a little bit I think if it dries especially with this red it lightens so you may have to go back and recolor it but I actually kind of like when it lightens up because it has a kind of white accents that a water down has it I guess make it look really like juicy but it depends there's not really a hard answer without depending on the color that you're using some may deepen some may lighten as the you know as the paint dries alright just a few more seeds here and this watermelon will be barbecue ready so if you guys are just joining again get to see highs hope to this case from the very beginning don't worry because this video is going to be on the food number Facebook page it'll be on the wall just a few minutes after this broadcast is done so make sure you check out the food number Facebook page to see this video on full answers back and don't forget to check out my Facebook page base by down on Facebook also check me out on instagram at baked by Dan because I have in profit shots of this cake and I'll put this video after the fact on my own Facebook as well so just a few more seeds I'm doing the indentation here just so disease kind of sit recessed into the cake looks a little bit cooler that white insiders have them stick on the outside good clean things out here so this is how I make a giant toasted watermelon cake just in time for summer let's cut this cake right there all this awesome work cut it open see how the milling truth so nice big 3 at night give this a nice cut right down the center so can be 1 2 3 plays of cake I'm Anthony and then let's see uh clean my knife off here some paper towel and I'll go in sideways make sure my slave system all off my table oh yeah 1/2 C watermelon cage there you go don't forget if you want to see how I arrived to the shape it was actually super easy once this video is done it will be post on the through network Facebook wall as well as on my own Facebook page you can check it out there if you guys have any questions don't hesitate to hit me up on my Facebook thanks bye Dan you guys have an awesome weekend we're about to enjoy this cake the crew and I I'll see you guys next week
so while my vegetable parmesan is baking I'm gonna get started on my artichoke and being crostini so what I'd like to do is cut up some rustic bread great so now just drizzle the top with a little bit of olive oil we're gonna bake them at 375 degrees about 10 minutes just until they get nice and golden brown while those bake up and they're clean up here and grab the rest of the ingredients make the puree so we need some artichokes some pecorino some prosciutto there we go we'll use the prosciutto a little bit pecorino a little bit we're gonna start with the artichokes I always have frozen artichokes and I like to make dips or put them in soups do lots of different things with them it just makes eating artichokes really easy cuz you don't have to clean them or do anything with them but you want us to follow them out so just take them out of the freezer and let them thaw in the fridge and because they're packed when they're really sweet and right do really good in the step so now that we have the artichokes we'll grab the beans and the lemon so I'm using some cannellini beans what's important when you use canned beans is that you drain and rinse them because that way you get rid of all the extra salt if they're packed in do a little bit of salt and pepper and lemon so the lemon is that ingredient that kind of perfumes the whole dip and makes all the flavors really come out so I had about a teaspoon of lemon zest and then we'll do three teaspoons of lemon juice and already smell so bright and sunny it really does it puts a big little smile on your face all right we're done with that so now roll it and we only need half of a lemon if you get a nice juicy lemon you'll get three teaspoons out of half eleven a little acidity to kind of counterbalance the creaminess of the beans and the flavor of the artichoke basil again it puts a smile on your face cuz it's so fresh and yummy the food processor tends to bruise things like basil they're very delicate so I'm just chopping it up so it doesn't get caught in the blades now we need a little cheese about a cup of pecorino romano and the pecorino is very similar to Parmesan cheese it's a lot Tangier and Parmesan cheese but it's similar process that it's aged in and if I could punch it so it adds a nice like salt effective perfect there we go and put the pecorino right in there it smells so good still buttery has a nice strong flavor to it which is really really good so now I want to give this a quick little whirl that perfect so now I want to add a quarter cup of olive oil now I just want to clean down the sides it's nice and thick just make sure that everything is really well incorporated sometimes things kind of fly up on the sides perfect perfect my assault perfect everything tastes really good alright so that's ready now we got something else we got to do here I I'm gonna start with my first shoot though so this is how I like to put the prosciutto in the oven to get it nice and crispy I take a little bit of vegetable spray and I spray baking sheet just like that grab the prosciutto and I went to the butcher and hadn't sliced the prosciutto super thin that way when I put it in the oven only takes a few minutes to get it nice and crispy and here we go with the prosciutto just need four slices that's it I just put them on there sometimes it can be a little tricky to take apart when there's thin now remember when you put them in the oven and it kind of intensifies that salty bite that salty flavor of the prosciutto that's kind of what I want plus it's crunchy you always want a little bit of a crunch so it's like crunchy on the bottom and creamy in the middle and then crunch on the top up next I'm gonna show you how to put all of this together get the vegetable parmesan out of the oven and make my melon and mid flush
I'm cutting my pizza dough for my niece Wacha today and basically it's like a Nicoise salad on a pizza so they're really fun I'm just taking a four inch cookie cutter and cutting out some store-bought pizza dough to make these I like them a little bit smaller though easier to eat when I have a spa day it's nicer to have smaller bits of food rather than you know a big old pizza that you cut in pieces everybody gets their own little beat City so the topping and the idea behind this is that the tapenade made of the Nicoise olives is actually all the flavors that you would find in a Nicoise salad so we're gonna use 1 cup of Nicoise olives and I like them because they're nice and rich and you can buy them I'm already pitted so it makes it really easy then we're gonna add one garlic clove again not overpowering with the garlic there we go we're also gonna add a little little lemon juice just to lighten the flavors up when I make a Nicoise salad I like to make a little lemon vinaigrette to go with everything kind of brightens up the flavors of the tuna and everything so instead this time I'm adding the lemon juice and the fresh citrus flavor into the tapenade then for a little bit of a bright sort of Irby flavor we're gonna add some rosemary and a little bit of thyme the rosemary is sort of slightly minty which I really like it's nice and earthy so it really stands up when you bake it in the oven you want herbs that are nice and hearty and then the thyme is nice and lemony so it works really well with the lemon that we just added in there kind of brightens up all of the flavors we'll just chop this up okay put that right in there we're gonna add some capers so I just buy some capers and then I just rinse and drain them it takes away some of the up saltiness of the capers then anchovies now a lot of times in Nicoise salad you will find anchovies as a kid I grew up eating lots of anchovies especially on my pizza so we're gonna use two anchovy fillets it's that little bit of salty bite that you just don't get um from regular salt you know you could also use anchovy paste if it's easier to kind of give it a little bit of moisture a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil about two tablespoons or so just so we can blend this all together so now let's blend it until it's smooth Oh smells so good so rich it looks so so pretty alright now here we go we are just gonna take some of the tapenade make sure that it's nice and and creamy and smooth so that you can spread it out on top of each piece of pizza dough so this is going to take the place of any tomato sauce what we're gonna do is we're just gonna slice some tomato and we're basically gonna put a slice of tomato on top of the tapenade place it right on top kind of push it ever so slightly so the tomato can stick to the tapenade and then I drizzle a little bit of olive oil just to keep the tomato nice and moist and give it a golden color we're gonna put these in the oven at 400 degrees for about 15 or 20 minutes and up next I'm gonna show you how to finish these guys off
the pound gets twisted so it's time to start on the chicken burgers they've got this great garlic rosemary mayo on it I've got Mayo and a pound of ground chicken we're gonna use 1 cup of mayo and we are going to make it super flavorful with some garlic and some rosemary so half of the mayonnaise is going to be in the burgers and the other half we're gonna smear on the bread we also need a quarter cup of rosemary so lots of rosemary to flavor the mayonnaise and because I have rosemary growing my backyard I like to use it as much as I can I just want to chop up the rosemary so you can combine it really well with the Mayo so now I had the rosemary right in there and one garlic so the garlic goes in grab spatula just mix it all together and already it perfumes the mail and it makes it look really pretty too so mix this all together so let's start now with the chicken we've got a pound of ground chicken but you could use whatever kind of what you have whatever you like and season it with a little salt and a little pepper and half of the mayo I just want to hold on to the other half for our buns there grab another spatula and remember this is a process you want to do kind of quick cuz you don't want to overwork the chicken cuz you want to have nice moist burgers I think it's gonna be really good who doesn't like a nice gourmet burger I think everybody does okay so now I'm gonna start forming the burgers I just want to make sure yep my grill pan is nice and hot make sure it's really hot before you start forming them because you don't want to touch anything after you're done forming them see it gets kind of sticky but I promise you although you think oh my gosh they're so wet and sticky this is what you want because that way they're nice and moist on the grill okay on the grill they go a little bit of olive oil then I take a little bit of mayo spread just a little bit of mayo on each one so we do this now and then we're gonna grill them and then we're gonna add a little bit more mayo on top when the burgers are done when we're assembling okay buns are done ready to flip and see they're really easy to flip if you let that crust form perfect so the burgers are going to finish cooking then I'm gonna toast my buns and assembly's burgers because a few finishing touches I still have to add the pound cakes twisted so it's time to start on the chicken burgers they've got this great garlic rosemary mayo on it I've got Mayo and a pound of ground chicken we're gonna use 1 cup of mayo and we are going to make it super flavorful with some garlic and some rosemary so half of the mayonnaise is going to be in the burgers and the other half we're gonna smear on the bread we also need a quarter cup of rosemary so lots of everybody does so now I'm gonna start forming the burgers I just want to make sure yep my grill pan is nice and hot make sure it's really hot before you start forming them because you don't want to touch anything after you're done forming them see it gets kind of sticky but I promise you although you think oh my gosh they're so wet and sticky this is what you want because that way they're nice and moist on the grill okay on the grill they go grab spatula just mix it all together and already it perfumes the nail and it makes it look really pretty too so mix this all together so let's start now with the chicken we've got a pound of ground chicken but you could use whatever kind of meat you have whatever you like and season it with a little salt and a little pepper and half of the mail I just want to hold on to the other half for our buns there grab another spatula and remember this is a process you want to do kind of quick because you don't want to overwork the chicken because you want to have nice moist burgers I think it's gonna be really good who doesn't like a nice gourmet burger rosemary to Flay or the mayonnaise and because I have rosemary growing my backyard I like to use it as much as I can I just want to chop up the rosemary so you can combine it really well with the Mayo so now I add the rosemary right in there and garlic so the garlic goes in

my gosh the food just landed on the table so excited okay how many times does this happen to you a friend calls up and says I'm in the neighborhood and I'd love to stop by well there's no need to worry because I'm gonna show you a few simple recipes you can whip up in no time it's really couscous with apples cranberries and herbs sweet tangy and very exotic chicken burgers with garlic rosemary mayonnaise a gourmet burger that's juicy and delicious and toasted pound cake with citrus cream simple ingredients that turn ordinary pound cake into a stunning dessert this is a last-minute menu that saves the day every time look she was that so I have a little olive oil in my pan and I've got this great Israeli couscous and they look like little pearls of pasta it actually is pasta but it kind of absorbs the liquid and they puff up and they look perfect because you can kind of spoon them and you can add lots of flavor to it but what I want to do is toast the two cups of Israeli couscous I just put them on medium high heat until the grains turn slightly golden all right while that toasts I'm actually going to toast something else to half a cup of slivered office and I love this crunch to the couscous just spread them out and then I like to toast them at 350 for just a few minutes until they're nice and light golden brown really brings out that nutty flavor so while those toasts let me check back on my couscous here see you can start to see them turning a really nice and light golden color like toasting bread it's the same thank you okay so to these really couscous I'm going to add four cups of chicken broth and you wanted to make that noise because it just means that the pan was hot so it was toasting the couscous when they absorbs all the chicken broth it gets really good flavor it really is yummy there we go so now you would just want to bring it to a boil and once it comes up to a boil I turn down the heat to about medium and let it cook just like you would let pasta cook so while the couscous cooks let's start in the vinaigrette really really easy so let's grab wheat apple cider vinegar maple syrup and while we're here some cranberries so we're nad cranberries to the actual salad but we'll do that in a minute first I'm gonna start with my apple cider vinegar and because I'm adding apples into these really couscous I thought it'd be nice to use apple cider vinegar so 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar start with that and 3 tablespoons of maple syrup it's thick and it's rich and it adds a nice bit of sweetness and so you want a little acidity in a vinaigrette you want a little sweetness in a vinaigrette as well then a little salt got a season it and a little pepper then extra virgin olive oil because it's a vinaigrette and it's equal parts of vinegar to the olive oil and that's it that is the whole dressing we're gonna keep it light and clean the girls are coming over for dinner you want lots of flavor and lots of color but you still want to keep it a little bit on the light side so that is what I'm doing we're at swap bowls now it's not a big bowl we're gonna mix the couscous with all these different flavors so let's start with some fresh herbs about a quarter cup of flat leaf parsley so we're gonna add flat leaf parsley some rosemary and some thyme and the fresh herbs are one of those things that you always want to have around whether you grow them or just have them in the fridge because they add a lot of flavor and lots of color that I've got some beautiful rosemary and a little bit of thyme to both really bold but really good in here and plus I'm gonna use some rosemary in my burgers so I thought why not use them a little bit in the couscous too so about one and a half tablespoons of rosemary it's nice and piney and fresh and really good a teaspoon or so of time not too much and the couscous is now boiling turn the heat down to about medium and let it continue to cook and you just want to chop up the rosemary and the thyme together because you kind of want to bruise it and release all the aromas and all the flavor it's smells so good there we go time to add the cranberries and I love dried cranberries they're chewy they're sweet and they have this beautiful red color look at this it just adds so much color to the couscous so about a cup of dried cranberries you know what you can smell my almonds time to get those almonds now they just need to be toasted just a little bit not too much so you don't ever want to forget about them perfect they're just lightly golden that's all you need to bring out the flavor otherwise they burn very quickly let those cool slightly and so I'm going to add a Granny Smith green apples just because it's more tart and it can really hold up with a vinaigrette there you go this is good add the nuts right on top that's it basically now we're just waiting for the couscous to finish it needs a couple more minutes and when I come back want to show you how to put this all together and get started on the easiest dessert my toasted pound cake with citrus cream sweet and refreshing this elegant dessert can be whipped up in no time
I admit it I like to play with my food sometimes I create dishes just to enjoy different colors and flavors like pizza topped with orange slices of roasted acorn squash white gorgonzola cheese and peppery green arugula sprinkled red on top fresh white tilapia fillets wrapped in purple potato slices topped with a green chive and rosemary flavored olive oil and to satisfy my sweet tooth a peach colored mango cheesecake with a bright sweet basil and lemon syrup today you can unleash your creative side and have fun with food Pizza is the ultimate fun food the possibilities are endless sweet and spicy flavors play off of each other in my colorful roasted squash and gorgonzola pizza the first thing I want to do for my pizza is roast my acorn squash now what I love about acorn squash is it's not as sweet as butternut squash and it has these beautiful little ridges so what I want to do is cut both ends off there we go see how pretty there I love the ridges so we're going to cut it in half acorn squash has a nutty flavor to it I know it sounds kind of weird for pizza but I'm telling you with the gorgonzola cheese it's going to be divine not always it going to taste great it's gonna look beautiful and that's the whole point we're having fun with food so you want to use lots of different colors and textures and flavors to create something really extraordinary out of these really simple ingredients all right so now that we've got that I'm going to take my acorn squash and I just want to cut little rings out of it so there we go there abouts make sure they're all separate now to sweeten it up just a little bit I'm going to add some maple syrup a couple tablespoons see look at that nice and thick a little bit of salt a little bit of black pepper got a squeezin the acorn squash and one add some red pepper flakes and gonna little bit of olive oil and then just want to kind of turn it all around just to make sure that the oil the salt and pepper everything sort of coats all of the acorn squash see how gray that looks perfect and now I'm gonna put it on my baking sheet and just kind of spread it all out cuz you want to make sure that they don't overlap so they can roast evenly get nice and golden brown so I'm gonna pop this in the oven at 375 for 20 to 25 minutes and in the meantime I'm gonna roll out my dough so I'm just using a one-pound store-bought pizza dough all right time to grate some cheese just like that all right there we go now I've got them let's set it up get it all out we'll take the pizza dough so we're just gonna add let's sit on the right on top okay we're also going to add a little bit of gorgonzola cheese now the gorgonzola will add a nice spicy sharp bite to the pizza and you only need about a half a cup so a cup of oats a ten and a half a cup of gorgonzola now before I bake the pizza I gotta take my acorn squash out look at that nice and golden-brown they shrink a little bit when they cook but they look so pretty with the little ruffled edges so so nice okay so now it's time to bake the dough 25 to 30 minutes at 375 degrees and then after that it's time to top the pizza look at that looks so good you can smell like organs Ola I like it so while that cools for a minute I'm going to take my acorn squash that has already cooled off and I'm gonna peel the skin and you could do this with again with pumpkin butternut squash any kind of squash you like and it's so pretty so now you want to top it with a little bit of arugula right over the top some fresh peppery arugula just take the paper leave it right over to the board I just want to add a little bit extra virgin olive oil right over the top this is a little Neapolitan trick my grandfather always does over fresh pizza it gives a little bit of flavor to to the arugula will add a little bit of salt and acetone of it a freshly ground black pepper over the top just to finish off the pizza now time to cut it here we go look at that so good I'm gonna cut myself a little slice look how beautiful that looks okay so now take the pizza put the arugula right over the top that's my slice that Joe is so good and of course you get a cheesy bite from the gorgonzola cheese and a nice creaminess from the mozzarella because it's melts all over the dough it's colorful it's fun and this is gonna brighten up any table
Todd are you gonna start the game you play yeah you can play I'm having some friends over tonight for some fun and games five-card stud poker for the grown-ups I call you twister for the kids had a venue for everyone zucchini and olive flatbread caramelize zucchini and salty olives smothered in a two cheese topping cauliflower bacon gratin a veggie dish that kids love thanks to crispy bread crumbs crumbled bacon and even more cheese and chocolate toffee Muscat pony bars the cookie dough chopped candy bars and chocolate need i say more it's food and fun for everyone I'm starting with dessert first and not just because I love dessert but because these chocolate toffee Muscat winner bars need some time to set up in the fridge what I love about these is that they are elegant and perfect for adults and the perfect little treats for the kids as well I have one pound of sugar cookie dough and it's just a store watcher and cookie dough and I think it works really well in here I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna doctor this up and make it all my own two of these chocolate toffee candy bars and what I like to do is chop them up nice and fine blues will add half of it inside the cookie dough and the other half will reserve it and Pat it on top so you get the crunch on the inside and the crunch on the outside too need a nice sharp knife there we go you want to kind of cut it up in small pieces so it can kind of melt in the cookie dough and that you don't have huge chunks on top either okay so now that we've got that grab the pool half of it goes inside and the other half we are going to reserve there we go so we'll leave that for a little bit later then I also want to add some vanilla extract so let's grab that and that's what I said I'm gonna doctor this up and make it all my own and no one's ever gonna know that it's prepared cookie dough there's so many great things on the market these days that really makes baking a lot easier so 1/2 a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and take a spoon and I mix this all together and kind of break it up and make sure that all gets incorporated really well even smells really good perfect so now I grab my baking sheet and I just sprayed a cookie spray all over it and then I put a piece of parchment paper over it and I sprayed the parchment paper just to make sure that I can just lift it all up like this and cut it into bars and nothing will stick then just put the dough right in the center there and I kind of just press it if the cookie dough gets sticky just wet your hands a little bit with water and you want a nice even layer and it bakes up so sugary and so buttery it's so hot now I prick it with a fork just so it doesn't grow too much in the oven it stays nice and flat and we're gonna bake it at 350 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes until it's light and golden all around the size so while that bakes let's get started on the topic we've got chocolate chips so we do one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips I love this we're gonna melt the chocolate and then we're gonna add Musk opponent to it and make it a nice thick and rich as a topping on top of the cooked sugar cookie dough there we go and I've already heated up a little bit of water so we're doing like a little water bath and patiently we're gonna wait for the chocolate chips to melt the chocolates melted look how beautiful this is it's just silky and rich and it shines and I love it so now I want to take it off the heat I want it to cool and I'm gonna grab my sugar cookie dough nice this is exactly what you want you want it to be nice and golden just like a tan on top so I'm gonna let that cool and the chocolate cool is in the meantime I'm gonna go set up my living room I've got a fun little grown-up table to set up so let's go a piece of green felt cut to size turns any surface into a very cool poker table and everyone gets their own little side table for food and drinks okay looks like we're ready to shuffle look so good in there this is gonna be really fun all right my chocolate is cooled so now it's time to add one cup of mascarpone cheese into the melted chocolate basically almost this whole thing the musket pointer is so nice it's nice and mellow and creamy it's perfect and you just see how you just mix it together and it creates a nice thick creamy topping and that's why it's really important you cool the chocolate a little bit after you melt it so that it combines very nicely it's nice and smooth perfect alright so we'll grab the cooled cookie dough and all I do is basically add all of the chocolate and must go to put a mixture to the center and then I spread it all out so you get a nice thick layer and just kind of spread it out and make sure it coats all of the cookie dough and we're just about to add the crunch some toasted sliced almonds and I just put them right over the top it just makes it look really pretty and gourmet it adds a little bit of crunch too and remember the leftover chocolate toffee candy bar that we cut up earlier here we go we're right on top so now we're gonna put it in the refrigerator and let it set for two hours then we'll lift it out and cut it into little bars and up next I'm gonna make one of my favorites my cauliflower and bacon Greta a rich and creamy dish that's loaded with bacon and layers of cheese
so my dough is chilled for two hours and now I just want to cut it in half and I like to store the rest of the dough in the freezer so that way whenever I need cookies I can bake them off so you just want to unwrap the cookies then you just want to cut them in about half inch pieces or so now that the dough is chilled it's really easy to cut through it all right so now the last ones cut I'm just gonna place them on my baking sheet that I'm lined with parchment paper and then pop them in the oven 350 for 15 minutes until they're nice and golden so now that the cookies have cooled it's time to make the icing I'm gonna use powdered sugar we're going to use one in three-quarter cups of powdered sugar to make the icing now the thing about powdered sugar is it's so fine that it dissolves very quickly and so it makes for the best kind of icing and for a little bit of flavor and because of course you need some kind of moisture to make the icing five tablespoons and I met it through liqueur now I mean it was like so sweet almond flavored liqueur I'm gonna give the cookies like this nice almond the flavor and they'll go really well with the almonds that are already in the cookies there we go just one okay now just take my whisk slowly whisk everything together and it should be a nice smooth consistency okay look at that yeah alright so now I take a cookie and the cookies are cooled it's really important that the cookies cool before you put the icing on them otherwise the icing melts all over the place and just kind of want to put a thin layer of the icing right over the top that pretty and as it hardens it becomes shinier and shinier so I get just put it right on top and when you go to nastya at the end of a meal they'll present you with a little cookie plate and a little cup of espresso so that's how I'm gonna end my video meal there we go it's so now I take I look up and I pour myself some espresso that I brewed earlier pour it right in there here we go and I grab a cookie the first thing you get is a chewiness from the apricot and the other thing brings everything together from cookie of course a sip up espresso little little colors with that so these press woke up I feel like I'm dining in Ostia

makes baking a lot easier so 1/2 a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and take a spoon and I mix this all together you kind of break it up and make sure that all gets incorporated really well even smells really good perfect so now I grab my baking sheet and I just sprayed a cooking spray all over it and then I put a piece of parchment paper over it and I sprayed the parchment paper just to make sure that I can just lift it all up like this and cut it into bars and nothing will stick then just put the dough right in the center there and I kind of just press it is the cookie dough gets sticky just wet your hands a little bit with water and you want a nice even layer and it bakes up so sugary and so buttery it's so good now I prick it with a fork just so it doesn't grow too much in the oven it stays nice and flat and we're gonna bake it at 350 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes until it's light and golden all around the sides so while that bakes let's get started on the topic we've got chocolate chips so we do one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and I love this we're going to melt the chocolate and then we're going to add mascarpone it to it and make it a nice thick and rich as a topping on top of the cooked sugar cookie dough there we go and I've already heated up a little bit of water so we're doing like a little water bath and patiently we're going to wait for the chocolate chips to melt the chocolates melted look how beautiful this is it's just silky and rich and it shines and I love it so now when I take it off the heat I want it to cool and I'm gonna grab my sugar cookie dough nice this is exactly what you want you want it to be nice and gold just like a tan on top so I'm going to let that cool and the chocolate cool is in the meantime I'm going to go set up my living room I've got a fun little grown-up table to set up so let's go a piece of green felt cut to size turns any surface into a very cool poker table and everyone gets their own little side table for food and drinks okay looks like we're ready to shuffle it looks so good in there this is gonna be really fun all right my chocolate is cooled so now it's time to add one cup of mascarpone cheese into the melted chocolate basically almost this whole thing the Muscat poni is so nice it's nice and mellow and creamy it's perfect and you just see how you just mix it together and it creates a nice thick creamy topping and that's why it's really important you cool the chocolate a little bit after you melt it so that it combines very nicely it's nice and smooth perfect all right so we'll grab the cooled cookie dough and all I do is basically add all of the chocolate and must get put a mixture to the center and then I spread it all out so you get a nice thick layer and just kind of spread it out and make sure it coats all of the cookie dough and we're just about to add the crunch some toasted sliced almonds and I just put them right over the top it just makes it look really pretty and gourmet it adds a little bit of crunch to and remember the leftover chocolate toffee candy bar that we cut up earlier here we go we're right on top so now we're going to put it in the refrigerator and let it set for two hours then we'll lift it out and cut it into little bars and up next I'm gonna make one of my favorites my cauliflower and bacon gratin a rich and creamy dish that's loaded with bacon and layers of cheese and take a spoon and I mix this all together kind of break it up and make sure that all gets incorporated really well even smells really good perfect so now I grab my baking sheet and I just sprayed a cookie spray all over it and then I put a piece of parchment paper over it and I sprayed the parchment paper just to make sure that I can just lift it all up like this and cut it into bars and nothing will stick then just put the dough right in the center there and I kind of just press it if the cookie dough gets sticky just wet your hands a little bit with water and you want a nice even layer and it bakes up social greeting so buttery it's so good now I prick it with a fork just so it doesn't grow too much in the oven it stays nice and flat and we're gonna bake

cookie dough and the other half will reserve it and add it on top so you get the crunch on the inside and the crunch on the outside to be a nice sharp knife there we go you want to kind of cut it up in small pieces so it can kind of melt in the cookie dough and that you don't have huge chunks on top either okay so now that we've got that grab the bowl half of it goes inside and the other half we

I started melting some chocolate for my s'more brownie bites these are sort of a mixture between the flavors of a s'more and the texture of brownies but they're little in the decadent so I just melted a stick of unsalted butter with 3/4 of a cup of mini chocolate chips now that it's melted I want to turn off the stove and pour this beautiful smooth melted chocolate right into this bowl add half a cup of sugar then we're going to add two eggs and the eggs are going to thicken this up and of course bind it it's a very very easy brownie batter to make so 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract for a little bit of gourmet sweetness so now we're gonna start blending this all together you just want to blend this until you get a nice smooth mixture it's gonna be can buy and add marshmallows and graham cracker now we're gonna add half a cup of regular all-purpose flour make sure you really measure it out that when we get the right consistency and thickness half a cup of quinoa flour and quinoa flour as you can see is very very fine it adds a nutty flavor to the brownies mix it until it gets nice and thick half a cup of mini chocolate chips you know what I love the most about cakes and brownies is when you bite into them and they have chocolate chips inside and it adds another like layer of chocolate which i think is always necessary but once you add these you want to just fold them in instead of using the mixer so you don't break up the mini chocolate chips so what you want to do now we grab a little bit and we go straight into the mini muffin tray then you take three little mini marshmallows and stick them right inside look how cute these are then I take the crushed graham crackers sprinkle them right over the top aren't they cute all right so I'm going to finish the rest of my little s'more brownie bites pop in the oven at 350 for about 10 to 12 minutes until the marshmallows are lightly golden my s'more brownie bites baked at 350 for 12 minutes and you can see that the marshmallows slightly melt and they becomes pale golden brown color the graham cracker is kind of set into the chocolate so now I get to taste it and they're still warm
let's face it the word leftovers doesn't exactly bring them running into the kitchen but all it takes for a few everyday items to turn your leftover ingredients into one delicious menu lemon chicken soup with spaghetti it's a great way to make rotisserie chicken last all week long this is a hearty soup that you can whip together in no time P pesto crostini crusty bread is even better the second time around and this colorful side dish tastes as great as it looks lemon mint cake with lemon syrup I love simple syrup add it to this light and airy cake and you're in for irresistible treat leftovers don't have to be boring these recipes turn yesterday's menu into exciting new dishes I'm starting with my lemon chicken soup with spaghetti and we're going to start with six cups of chicken broth and I'm using low-sodium chicken broth because I like to control how much salt goes into my chicken soup so I'm just turning on the stove about medium-high and we're gonna grab some lemon two lemons and some carrots now I know that traditionally you obviously don't put lemon juice in chicken soup but I'm telling you this is really good the lemon juice makes it really bright and really brings out all the flavors and kind of just gives it a little bit of that like zing that little punch so we're gonna add about a third of a cup of lemon juice but you're gonna get from approximately two lemons you know what it does the lemon juice really just makes chicken soup really happy it makes you smile and we've got two carrots so you can add whatever else you want celery or onion if you want to but for me it's all about the carrots and that's really all we need because we're going to add some other really good stuff in here so I already wash the carrots ahead of time and now just want to peel them because I'm adding all these different ingredients to it it makes it a really creative new dish and that's what I love about it I want to cut the carrot into little pieces and you can cut them any which way you want you know sometimes people like chunkier pieces in their chicken soup I like them kind of medium and I just put them directly into the pot this is great because a one pot meal and it's so good put that in there so let me give this a quick little stir just to make sure that everything mixes together so now for one of the special ingredients in here and I really do think that this is special the bay leaf and the bay leaf kind of adds that warmth to the chicken soup and you only want to add one hot smells good because it can be pretty strong what you do is you just let it simmer in there and release all those flavors and it gives it that warmth that I love so now let's grab the spaghetti and the chicken so you got some spaghetti and we'll just read chicken all right so before we add the spaghetti I want to add one of my special ingredients here my rind and as Parmesan cheese rind you can use romano cheese rind or Parmesan cheese rind but I have extra rinds just sitting in my fridge and what I like to do with them this is a great way to use these leftovers is to toss it into the broth it slowly starts to soften in there and melt into the soup which gives it an unbelievable flavor and the rind is not plastic or anything it's all natural so it can melt in there and it's good for you that's all good and I'm also going to add about a handful of spaghetti just take this biggity and I just break them up there we go and you can use whatever kind of pasta you want and I like the long pasta in the chicken soup it makes it really good and really pretty so you just add that all in there and add the spaghetti cooks moving on to the rotisserie chicken there we go so I use the legs earlier in the week so now I want to use the breasts and this is what I do I use about a cup of meat and I'm gonna leave the skin on just because it's gonna give the chicken more flavor and you can shred it or you can cut it up I'm just going to cut it up because it makes it look a little bit prettier and I just cut it into little cubes just like that smells good I'm just so yummy what I do is I just take the chicken and put it directly into the chicken stock and all you really want to do to the chicken is heat it through so while the pasta cooks it's going to take about I don't know five to eight minutes to get that all done so it's pretty quick so let's add a little bit salt and a little bit of pepper give it a stir and while that cooks I'm gonna chop up some fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley a little bit of fresh flavor and again when you cook something you know for a period of time you want to add some fresh herbs right on top so give that a quick chop and smells good and the parsley add beautiful color now I'm going to add a little bit of Romano cheese and what I do here is I just grate the remodel right into the soup then Romano sharper than Parmesan cheese so it gives it kind of a pungent flavor and then we're going to add a little bit more right into the bowl right before I eat it so it slowly starts to melt in there so the soups going to cook a little bit longer and up next I'm going to make these peat pasta crostini that's going to be perfect with the chicken soup and look how gorgeous a few simple ingredients transform crusty bread into something truly gourmet new dish and that's what I love about it I want to cut the carrot into little pieces and you can cut them any which way you want you know sometimes people like chunkier pieces in their chicken soup I like them kind of medium and I just put them directly into the pot this is great cause a one pot meal and it's so good got that in there so we give this a quick little stir just to make sure that everything mixes together so now for one of the special ingredients in here and I really do think that this is a special the bay leaf and the bay leaf kind of adds that warmth to the chicken soup and you only want to add one smells good because it can be

spaghetti and we'll just read chicken all right so before we add the spaghetti I want to add one of my special ingredients here my rind in as Parmesan cheese Ronnie can use Romano cheese rind or Parmesan cheese wine but I have extra rinds just sitting in my fridge and what I like to do with them this is a great way to use these leftovers is to toss it into the broth it slowly starts to soften in there and melt into the soup which gives it an unbelievable flavor and the rind is not plastic or anything it's all natural so it can melt in there and it's good for you that's all good and I'm

I can't wait to when I can hug her and get closer and she'll actually appreciate it and not try to push me away it will be a looking forward to yes it's time to get started my mother a raspberry brown sugar panini it's basically like a dessert panini or dessert sandwich but it is so good and so delicious and so beautiful with the colors that it makes me very happy so what I like to do is this I take a nice rustic white bread and I just cut this end off of it because I want to use the inside part of the bread so the slices are all the same size I want to get eight about half inch slices from the spread okay so now I just like to put the bread on my sheet pan here and drizzle it both sides with some olive oil it gets a nice golden brown color and it keeps the bread nice and moist - there we go and I want to flip them all there we go and do the other side as well it gives the bread that nice crunch factor now what I'd like to do when I make paninis is kind of get all the ingredients together and ready before I start assembling so that everything is made and ready to go so we have some fresh rosemary now I love the smell of the rosemary it's nice and piney and I think the rosemary with the raspberry he's really really yummy and you know when I was a kid my mom used to make us raspberry jam I'm brown sugar so she'd put raspberry jam and then brown sugar on the top of the bread and then put it in the pinion maker and it was just this crunchy sweet you know instead of lots of cookies we'd have that perfect so you've got our chopped rosemary then we have matzo dead this Casa della is so good it's fresh mozzarella and you can buy it at the grocery store in the specialty food section and it usually comes packed in a little bit of water to keep it nice and moist so what I do

I do is I get my bread and I add a just like couple spoonfuls of jam and I really like raspberry jam so I like a lot of it and just kind of spread it on the bread there we go okay so now a little bit of rosemary just a little bit because the rosemary is pretty strong so you only need a little bit of that then two slices of mozzarella cheese so it can melt and ooze all over and a slice of bread and I just like to add some brown sugar and see the olive oil helps the brown sugar stick to the bread so we get a nice caramelized crust when we put it in the panini maker just like that then I take the sandwich and I put it in a hot panini maker it's going to take about five minutes for the cheese to melt and for the top to get nice and caramelized and in the meantime I'm gonna continue assembling the rest of my sandwiches look at that panino whoo baby look at how that cheese has oozed out yeah look at that crust on top yes all right before I cut that one I want to put the next one on there we

when I have a day off it doesn't mean I don't cook it means that cook what I want today my aunt Raffy is coming over to help me make comfort food with the rich flavors of Tuscany we're gonna make an easy batch of pasta dough and use it in three dishes like corn totally filled with cheese and corn and topped with tarragon butter crab salad Napoleon's are as elegant as they are delicious and sweet fresh fettuccine uses honey and citrus to make pasta a dessert treat this is comfort food for your taste buds you filled pasta makes great comfort food and that's why I love Tortelli I fill these little pasta pillows with corn and a mix of cheeses a simple tarragon butter sauce lets the flavors shine through if you never made fresh pasta before don't worry it's easier than you think and it's worth it once you taste these corn totally so one of my favorite comfort foods to make when I have a little extra time is fresh past that now because Raffy and I cook all the time together I thought it'd be a fun thing for us to make baby was going to make pasta all right Horace so why don't we do this I'm gonna start by measuring the flour okay so we're gonna actually I know we're gonna make it in the food processor but the only reason I like to make in the food processor is because I feel like you know obviously I learned to make it with the well well would it beat the eggs inside the flat or the mess okay so will you beat the eggs for me yes add a little bit of olive oil a little salt yes to it and I will measure the flour and when you measure the flour you want to make sure and level it off so using just the right amount and the eggs now I think it's really important with the eggs that they're large eggs not extra-large not small and that there are room temperature so I've got three cups of flour I have to measure here and I can't do it well again it's olive oil and if you add too much the dough gets sort of slimy and if you don't add enough then it doesn't have that wonderful fruity flavor that I love from adding a little olive oil it also turns the dough a nice yellow color which I think looks really nice and it helps when you need it yeah but here you left a little bit there every little drop a big size measuring did you add a little salt yep perfect all right see it's very easy it's just flour eggs a little olive oil and a pinch of salt it doesn't get any easier than that things that you should always have in your kitchen or in your pantry but I'm done I don't that I'm ready so I'm just gonna add the eggs right into the flour all right give that back to you and then give it a quick little quick little pulse just a couple of times just until all the ingredients bled together right now if you wanted a fee you could put a little flour on your board because yeah you're gonna knead the dough for me is that okay yeah okay the dough won't actually ever come into a ball but the way you know it's ready is if you stick your fingers like this and it stays together it's ready to come out of the food processor I have to say this does make it easier right you're at this or too much flour in that No so you need a little bit and then you let it rest so while you do that I'm gonna make the filling for our pie get the top job I'm making you work today what can I say and a lot of Italian families people make fresh pasta but we have a little bit different I mean a little more extensive history with Nana Dino your grandfather my father right your great-grandparents on the pasta factory in Torre Annunziata right and now it's before World War two right before during and a little bit after also I believe and didn't know no Dino like any siblings go door to door or something and know your grandfather yeah how do you know yeah went was sent to school and he escaped from school when he was 14 he said he didn't want to study I understand that some his father said okay if you don't want to study you're gonna work in the past effector okay and so at 15 he started traveling around Italy selling the pasta with the past in a suitcase selling pasta and there guys think what Bernard did his you know love for food and and how he became a wonderful salesman yep everybody that said yo who is he's not afraid salesman so for the filling I'm just doing some creamed corn one and a half cups and a whole though it's not a very Italian ingredient I like the cream corn just cuz it's smooth and slightly sweet but it's also salty so it's kind of a great combination then some mascarpone there again that a little bit of florally smooth creaminess just half a cup and then goat cheese the perfect sort of compromise between the two cheese's has a little bit of tennis from the goat cheese and a little bit of sweetness from the mascarpone and I love that for tarragon and what I love about the tarragon it has sort of an anise flavor to it it's just the anise flavor sort of brightens up the filling so and of course a little fresh black pepper so the filling is done the dough is done did after why don't you cover the dough with one of those towels right there will cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes the filling is done so up next we are gonna make the topping for the fresh pasta okay as soon as that's ready we're gonna start making some fresh pasta
first time so the idea is you're gonna roast those right and then you're gonna put them on those crostini that I made that have butter and sugar sounds like a crust on and then we're gonna put a piece of chocolate but not any old chocolate John do you chocolate what kind of Dragoon yeah hey John do you jack on his milk chocolate and hazelnuts these are Italian s'mores you guys who's gonna make you an engine I've got somebody stick here Jonna you like Bert yeah I like very careful I know your marshmallow I artists but I just want you to be careful what's it like to be like you I give me how did you I think you can love me that one to everything jumper that's a joke Carrie
good Italian food doesn't always mean big plates of pasta or heavy meaty dishes sometimes just a few bites our best mozzarella in Carrozza is the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich if you like baked clams you'll love my clams casino little mouthfuls that promise big flavor pizza day with gorgonzola tomato and basil is like a palm-sized pizza and how's this for fast food crunchy Parmesan chicken tenders baked not fried on this show the best dishes come in small packages here's a party favorite for kids of all ages crunching homemade chicken tenders that don't even have to be deep-fried covered in breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese they come out of the oven crispy and perfect for dipping in my creamy vinaigrette I love making these chicken tenders because they make great snack food and I've even figured out a way to Italian eyes them so I'm gonna take the chicken tenders and put them in this bowl and we're gonna marinate them in some buttermilk now the thing about chicken tenders is there are the strips of meat they're located under the chicken breast so as the name leads you to believe they are very tender and that's why I love them we're gonna add a cup of buttermilk the buttermilk helps tenderize the chicken even more it also gives them a nice Tang just leave them in there make sure they're all covered nicely and you want them to sit and marinate for about 15 minutes or up to a half hour it really does break the meat down the proteins in the chicken and help make it really tender okay so we'll leave those alone in the meantime I'm gonna make the coating we're gonna use three-quarters of a cup of bread crumbs and there's seasoned Italian bread crumbs so they've got Italian seasonings in it they've got dried parsley a little maybe a little bit of thyme if you don't buy the Italian seasoning or you just have in your pantry regular plain bread crumbs go ahead and add some dried herbs to them and of course we're gonna add freshly grated Parmesan cheese and mix it together and this is a good time to buy the pregrated stuff so you have to sit here and grate all your cheese otherwise if you have little nubs or little stubs of Parmesan cheese left over in the fridge throw them in the food processor you'll get this nice ground-up Parmesan cheese you can use for things like this we'll leave that alone and in the meantime I'm gonna make the dressing and this is what I'm gonna dip the chicken tenders in I'm gonna take a couple cloves of garlic here I crush them with a little bit of force just because I'm going to make a paste out of the garlic and making a paste out of the garlic really intensifies the flavor and I really want that for the dipping I'm just gonna chop it just a little bit so you want to get it into a nice mince and then we're gonna add some salt to it the salt helps break down the garlic even further and helps create a paste and right against a flat surface just go ahead and just make it into a paste and you can see that there's a little bit of liquid and moisture coming out of the garlic and that is what you want okay that looks good and add a little bit more salt in there a little bit of freshly ground pepper and about three tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and it's thick and a little bit sweet it helps add that tang and acidity to the to the vinaigrette but also gives it a little bit of sweetness mix that together I love to play the balsamic vinegar now we're gonna add about 1/2 a cup of extra virgin olive oil and again this is where you want to spend the money on good olive oil because really taste it here it makes a big difference between an okay dressing and are really good dressing believe that and when my chicken is finished marinating I'm gonna dredge it in the breadcrumb and Parmesan mixture get it in the oven just make sure and shake off the extra buttermilk that way you don't get a clumpy crust the thickness from the buttermilk also helps the the breadcrumbs in the parmesan mixture stick to the chicken tenders and you can also make them ahead of time make them in the morning cover them with plastic wrap and just pop them in the fridge and pull them out and bring them to room temperature before you stick them in the oven that way they cook evenly all the way through drizzle the top with a little bit of olive oil and just so that there's a little bit of moisture that the breadcrumbs can sort of absorb and create that wonderful golden crust as if you had fried them so that's the trick to getting that beautiful fried color that golden brown is to Joy's a little bit of olive oil right on top ok now I'm gonna pop them in the oven 500 degrees for 12 minutes and then it's time to dig into them you
a lot of my friends have kids and some of them are coming over today I want to serve something that will make everyone happy food that's just as much fun for grownups as it is for the kids like fun individual pot pies stuffed with pizza fillings roasted chicken broccoli and mozzarella cheese and a garden of vegetables mixed with cheese and rolled up together in a pancake then baked in a creamy sauce and everyone loves this dessert cupcakes filled with strawberry mascarpone cream these dishes aren't just kid stuff adults will love them too I'm gonna make something fun for the kids that the adults will love too I've created individual pot pies with a flavor everyone loves pizza it's incredible how much flavor fits into each of my pizza pot pies the first thing I want to do for my pizza potpie is make the tomato sauce so I'm gonna add just a tablespoon of olive oil and start heating up my pan because we're gonna make a sauce maybe pancetta I just have a 2 ounce piece of pancetta and I just want to cut it into little cubes now pancetta is basically very similar to bake and it's basically Italian bacon although it's not smoked and it's a little bit sweeter so I think it's perfect for the kids so we'll take the pancetta dump it into the pan and then we're gonna add two cloves of garlic the garlic will flavor the tomato sauce garlic is done okay so now I'm also gonna add a little bit of rosemary now the fresh rosemary just gives the sauce a nice intense elegant flavor a little bit salt pepper stir it up a little bit so one thing that you think it's nice and golden you can have the tomatoes and I've got one can of crushed spend my time on Tomatoes here you want to bring the heat down so like medium-low and you want to simmer it for 15 minutes so that way the flavors of the Panchita the garlic and the rosemary infuse the tomato sauce and make it really yummy awesome okay so while that cooks I'm gonna make the filling for the potpie and we're gonna start with one and a half cups of diced nuts that I like just plain old store-bought mozzarella cheese and I love the way the mozzarella melts it makes the interior of the potpie gooey and yummy like a pizza just like a pizza top then a little bit of broccoli so this is what I like to do I like to hide the vegetables for the kids so they almost don't know they're eating their vegetables the kids will get their veggies and I'll love every single bite I want two cups of chicken just dice it I just went to the grocery store and bought two rotisserie chicken breasts now I just want to pour the sauce right on top just want to mix it all together nice hot I just think it's fun because the kids are gonna sort of open it up and just discover what's in there turning the ramekins over and I'll show you how I do this so I have six ten ounce ramekins and I want to fill them with the filling and I filled it almost to the top there and then we're gonna top them with with pizza dough all right I'm gonna clean up a little bit and start rolling out my dough to top these ramekins I have a one and a half pound pizza dough that I just bought at my local pizzeria and I've basically just rolled it out to about 1/4 inch thick now that I rolled it out I'm gonna take this big cookie cutter and I'm gonna cut little circles out and those cookie cutters about 4 inches or so wide there we go one more we'll bring the tray over and we'll take one circle at a time as you want it to hang over just like that see and the dough will stick right on top of the ramekin how easy is that last one here we go put it over the top just like that okay so now that we've done that I'm going to add a little bit of olive oil to the top of each one just add a little bit to the top just like that just like you would a pizza and then take a pastry brush and just kind of brush it all the way around besides the top so that the crust comes out nice and golden brown when the kids see it they're like oh that looks so good I want to take a little paring knife just make a little slit right on top just so the air can escape and then for a little extra topping and really make these pizza pop I'm gonna grate a little bit of Parmesan cheese right on top see the Parmesan cheese sticks to the olive oil and it creates this cheesy yummy pizza crust on top it's rain and cheese I'm top of the pot pies that's it so now I'm gonna bake them at 400 degrees for 25 minutes until the cheese is melted the inside is fully cooked and the top is golden brown this is gonna be so much fun you
so it's time for my mango lime Bellini and a Bellini is a classic Venetian cocktail except that I'm gonna give it a different spin and I'm gonna just add a little bit of mango nectar and a little bit of lime juice traditionally in Venice they make it with peach so when I do this I take a little wedge of lime and we're just gonna run it around the rim of this little champagne flute then I'm gonna take the glass I'm gonna put it in some sugar and you've got a beautiful sugary rim which I just love and I take that same wedge and I just squeeze the juice right into the glass and the lime just takes out a little bit of that bite of the sweetness of the mango then we take some mango nectar and we're gonna pour about a quarter cup and then for the fun stuff the bubbly we're gonna do some Prosecco so it's Hallion sparkling wine got to have the Prosecco right yeah love it okay so then we're gonna pour about a quarter cup or so of the Prosecco directly on top of the mango nectar and that is my mango lime Bellini I just love the color and I love the whole combo but most of all I love the taste it's a perfect pairing with a little tart a little sweet and of course the effervescence and it finishes it all off with a little bit of sugar this is good stuff here's to Venice
man it looks good you can see the salmon on top and the arugula it's nice and golden brown and while that cools I'm gonna get started on my chicken meal and easy with my tomato and fennel sauce and I've got three bowls cuz we're gonna bread this chicken I just want to measure out a little bit of flour all right now we need two eggs so the flour allows the old to stick to the chicken and then the egg allows the breadcrumbs to stick to it so you need all three to get that nice crispy crust there we go so two eggs so just want to beat then we need some store-bought breadcrumbs need that nice crispy crust so we need some fine breadcrumbs right in there and we're gonna season the breadcrumbs so I'm gonna add a little bit of dried thyme a little bit of dried basil and you can use whatever kind of herbs you like and some Parmesan cheese so just add a little Parmesan cheese in here there we go and I just want to mix it all together I want to fry them up a little bit of vegetable oil so I can get a nice golden-brown crust without the chicken cutlets burning and doesn't have any flavor and you want them nice and thin so they cook quickly there we go and I have got five pieces because I figured since I was gonna make this for Vanessa I could make an extra chicken cutlet for myself a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper and then we're gonna flip them and season the other side and a little pepper now let's start and we'll dip the chicken in the flour first just kind of shake it and get any extra flour off and into the egg and then into the breadcrumbs then we go make sure that all the chicken gets coated then we get a nice even crust everywhere okay here we go nice sizzling sound all right last one into the pad and these are gonna cook about three to four minutes on each side so in the meantime I'm gonna clean up so the chickens been cooking about three minutes and yeah nice and golden-brown on the other side yeah you can see the cheese actually melted into the crust it looks good okay so now they need to cook another two or three minutes on the other side in the meantime while I wait for those to cook I'm gonna get started on the sauce okay we're gonna start with some fennel we're just gonna cut the tops off and just cut the bottoms ever so slightly and then with the fennel what I like to do is just like an onion it's almost like peeling the outer layer of the onion you take the outer leaf off and I do the same thing with the top I'll cut the tops off just clean the bottom off a very thin slice and then I just cut just the outside leaf just take it out and then I take the inside and you cut it in half and I just kind of slice it thin there we go so the fennel is ready I'm gonna grab my platter I just lined the plate with some paper towel just absorb any of the extra grease while it cools they've been cooking about three minutes and let's check yeah you want to check the bottom and make sure that's nice and golden-brown so one out there we go and then we'll let them cool slightly before we pack them up there we go all right I'm going to place the chicken back here while I finish the sauce and let's cook the fennel in there and I want to cook the fennel in the same pan that I cook the chicken just so we can keep all that flavor in there a little salt and a little bit of pepper right in there just to season it and soften the fennel a little bit the fennel is gonna cook for about five minutes or so just until it softens and then when I come back I'm gonna show you how to put this all together and later a tower of sweetness its fruity gooey and dripping with chocolate

you can bite and you can buy jarred but what I like to do is make it from scratch I'm talking about tomato sauce something that is very simple to cook and store you can toss it with any kind of pasta or dress it up with your favorite ingredients for something a bit harder all it takes is a few basic ingredients and in less than 30 minutes you've got a simple tomato sauce for my tomato sauce I like to use a heavy enameled cast iron pot and the reason i like to use it it just distributes the all the heat evenly my vegetables that I'm going to use and my tomato sauce so it doesn't burn the bottom but if you don't have it any stock pot will work just make sure and stir the sauce often so it doesn't stick to the bottom and burn so first I'm going to heat it up just a medium-low heat so by the time I'm done cutting up all my vegetables my pot will be warm I'm going to add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil and add so much flavor to the vegetables I like to use these yellow onions a little bit sweeter and milder and then they use my knife myself make a little slit a little incision and then I'm going to peel the outer skin off of it and we're going to cut it in half that way I can get a nice firm grip on my onion and it doesn't roll around my cutting board first I cut the onion vertically then I cut it horizontally and that makes dicing easier we'll add a little bit of sea salt to draw out all the moisture out of the onion next we're going to add some garlic when you're buying garlic you want to look for a tight firm head or bulb and a nice white color tip my knife pound it run on it it makes it easier to peel you want to make sure and not burn your garlic it becomes bitter when it turns a dark brown color and it makes the whole sauce bitter so I'm going to slowly sweat my vegetables but just means allowing all the natural sugars and liquid to come out of them immediately the aroma is all that sweet pungent flavor comes out of the garlic since it hits the heat now this onion garlic carrot and celery mixture is known as a mirepoix it's just a base flavor for making stews and sauces the carrot adds a fresh sweetness to the sauce okay so these are starting to sweat so I'm going to add one more layer of flavor here which is bay leaf they're really wonderful and flavoring tomato sauces and stocks and stews but you can't eat them they're have a rough leaf and we're going to take it out at the end and won't eat it leave that alone we're going to get our canned tomatoes ready I like to use crushed canned tomatoes they're picked and canned when they're the rightist they make a really hearty thick wonderful sauce seasoned it a little sea salt some fresh ground black pepper you're going to let it simmer for an hour so some of the water will evaporate and we'll get a nice thick sauce and you know I love to make the sauce once every couple weeks and then I just store it in my refrigerator or my freezer because I use it so often in everyday cooking that it's just great to have so every day I don't have to sit here and make sauce so handy and it's just so delicious
so I've started making my marshmallow stirs from my white hot chocolate and what I did is I just melted some semi-sweet chocolate and I'm dipping the marshmallows in the chocolate look at that and I put these little popsicle sticks right in there so that it's really easy to swirl them in the hot white chocolate and we're going to pop them in the fridge the chocolate sets and let me grab my vanilla flavored almond milk so I'm gonna make this with almond milk instead of regular milk which i think is gonna be really fun I've got six cups that we're going to heat up and I thought I would give this white hot chocolate I'm nutty your flavor or grab a couple of spices here so I'm going to make this super super yummy what we're going to do is add a little bit of cinnamon a little bit of nutmeg so we're going to do one teaspoon of cinnamon and cinnamon adds a nice warmth nice and sweet it's kind of like a bear hug that's what I always think and we're gonna add a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg so not a lot because nutmeg tends to be quite strong it's warm but it's not as sweet as a cinnamon it's very spicy without being hot which I think the kids are gonna really like and let's give this a quick little stir and nutmeg works really well with anything creamy all right so the almond milk has heated up nicely and it's just barely simmering so we're gonna turn off the heat I'm gonna start adding three bars of white chocolate last bar I think this will be really fun to drink out of our little camping cups over there let's give it a stir and slowly start melting the white chocolate and you want to do this off the heat so that the white chocolate doesn't settle to the bottom and burn so we're gonna add a tablespoon of agave I'm using vanilla flavored almond milk but it's unsweetened so you do want to add a little bit of sweetener and they got a melts beautiful in here it's not as sweet as sugar so I really like it the white chocolate has melted little a little bit now let's grab the marshmallow stir just gonna grab one gotta save the rest for everybody else and see how the chocolate sets right on the marshmallow and then you dip it in there it slowly starts to melt it and warm through look at that if that isn't decadent I don't know what is you
so I've just diced almost all my vegetables here for my caponata 1 onion 1 celery stock 1 eggplant and now I'm doing the red pepper I'd say it's sort of like an Italian side dish it's like a relish and in Italy you'll find a lot that it's served with meat just as a side or a topping so it's really yummy but for me what I like to do with this is put it in the sandwich with some melted cheese and turn it into a panini now the thing is it sounds like well it's just a veggie sandwich but actually it's not just a veggie sandwich it's a sandwich that the veggies are cooked in sort of a sweet and sour type of sauce that I create with like raisins and red wine vinegar a little sugar so it's really yummy and super hearty as you can tell from all the veggies on my board it's going to be really really colorful and delicious I'm going to start by cooking all the vegetables now I like to use prep all the veggies have them ready to go that way I can add them in as soon as I need I'm not playing catch-up and I start cooking my onion and my celery and depending on where you go in Italy you'll find different vegetables in it and it just kind of depends on like what you have and what kind of vegetables you like so some people like to have zucchini and squash for me I really like a lot of color and these are my favorite things to make it with will salt a little pepper give it a quick little toss here he's going to slowly start cooking down the onions then I add eggplant with this kind of dish you don't have to worry about salting the eggplant because it's gonna cook down and get nice and soft and red pepper there we go get that all in there a little more salt a little more pepper and a little more olive oil there we go it's about 1/4 cup of olive oil in all but the eggplant really absorbs the flavors a lot it's kind of like a sponge so the more olive oil you use the more absorbs it so while that cooks grab my tomatoes and raisins and I know it sounds kind of weird but the reasons that really really good little sweetness that little bite of sweetness that you get kind of intense so let's start with the tomatoes and the tomatoes basically it's not too much tomato supposed to be like slightly pink it's not supposed to be like tomatoes saucy but you want a little tomato because that sort of gives all the juices and helps cook all the veggies if you want a little bit of moisture in the caponata mix it all together see the colors is looking good raises about three tablespoons and I kind of just like measure it with my hands that looks good so this is the sweetness the masala will add afterwards it's going to take a few minutes to cook down and in the meantime I'm going to grab the rest of my ingredients so all the veggies have cooked down and it's so funny because you start out with this big mound of vegetables and it just doesn't look like the same thing anymore but look at how Hardy it is so I've got a couple more things to add I told you it was a sweet and sour type of dish so little taneous Redwine vinegar it has a little bit of tartness so a quarter cup this is the traditional way of making it I'm going to add four teaspoons of sugar a little sweetness from the raisins and less sweetness from the sugar three and four you just want to give it a quick pulse jerks do you want the sugar to dissolve and some capers now I love capers keeper berries are so yummy because they're this little berry that grows on the caper tree and you bite into and it's super tangy about a tablespoon or so it's funny cuz Todd never used to like capers and I've sort of introduced them to him and now he loves them and oregano a little bit of dried oregano it adds a little bit of hardiness it makes it warm and really good just gonna give like a pinch or so and just give this a quick little stir and some of that red wine vinegar kind of evaporates you can kind of it smells good it kind of opens up all the sinuses okay so now grab the bread and the cheese so I like to use provolone cheese it's nice and sharp I think what melts really nicely at the vegetables and it makes again it makes the sandwich harder so that it can stand up to being the main course so I just cut the slice in half add it right there then you take this the top of the bread and I've scooped out just a little bit of bread just to create a little pocket for the caponata and I take the bottom flip it over there we go and now put it in the little panini maker and we're just going to heat it up for like three or four minutes heat it all up together so becomes one big sandwich we're going to continue that do a piece of the provolone a cut it in half so it fits on the little dummy baguette just like that and take the caponata and kind of spoon it in a little pocket that you've created there we go so good even just like this it's so good okay look at that a perfect little sandwich alright let's take a look at this one I'm going to grab a spatula see how smushed down already Jesus started to melt I just want to let it cool down before I pack it up so I'm going to keep grilling and assembling the rest of my sandwiches and then I'm going to get started on my gourmet deviled eggs with crap these eggs are an elegant variation on a picnic classic
Cheers tea tea dessert is a must I've got a family recipe that promises to Wow Italian doughnuts it's so easy because I use store-bought pizza dough they can be enjoyed warm with a dusting of cinnamon sugar or dipped in gooey chocolate and crowned with crushed espresso beans or toasted almonds who doesn't like donuts well I know that I love donuts and this is the way my mom used to make donuts for us and the kid take some pizza dough and all you have to do is buy pizza dough from either the grocery store or go to your favorite pizzeria and ask them for a ball of dough make sure it's nice and cold flour the surface a little bit and we're gonna roll it out these are so much fun you have to roll it out until it's a half an inch thick and then we're gonna deep-fry now who does my deep fried dough I don't know many people who don't and in Italy these are very similar to a Tuscan donut called bomboloni okay just roll it out just like that get the air out of it and I'm gonna take a cookie cutter and I'm just gonna make sure that it doesn't stick so we're gonna put some flour over the dough and then we're gonna cut out circles see just like that then I'm gonna take this little one-inch little cookie cutter let's see pile these up over here and go around and just cut them so I've used half vegetable oil which is really like to the bottom to the top and the thing is you don't wanna over fry these you don't want these to become a really dark color because it'll make the dough too tough on the inside 45 seconds per side and they'll still be sort of pale my first ones are almost ready that's it for a minute I'll show you how to make a topping this is the easiest topping and this is the one that my mom made the most very popular just take some granulated sugar and some cinnamon ground-up cinnamon mmm smells like Christmas it has a little spice to it so it gives the donuts a little bit of spicy flavor perfect cinnamon sugar done now this one's ready as you can see nice and pale in color but they puffed up there we go okay so now I'm just gonna dust them I'm actually dredge them and some cinnamon sugar the trick to putting the topping of the cinnamon sugar on these donuts is that they're still hot so the cinnamon sugar sticks to them just like that and guess what now you're ready to pop in my mouth how often you get to eat a warm doughnut straight out of oil like crunchy and perfectly sweet remember the best way to make donuts I promise you gotta try it not only is the cinnamon sugar fantastic but I like to dip it blue ganache now ganache is a French word for basically melted chocolate with heavy cream and that beautiful we can top it in some nuts some toasted almonds so I take slivered almonds I toasted them and then I sort of break them up with my fingers and there you go another fantastic looking doughnut and let's see we'll do another one here we'll do it again in the almonds and you could top it with any nuts you want it can be walnuts it could be hazelnuts I just happen to love the almonds you could even do white chocolate dark chocolate it works really well with the milk chocolate here and now in espresso beans it's got a kind of a strong contrast flavor now this looks heavenly doesn't it this is perfection

my aunt Raffy is cooking with me today and we are having lots of fun today is all about remembering Rome and because we were both born there we have lots of memories so we're making a family favorite bucatini amatriciana with spicy meatballs only Raffy has a slightly different version of the recipe okay so you had the onion in there I'm going to open the tomatoes for you and I'm gonna grab another one of these and I like the sauce I like the sauce - I was just tasting the vegetable you want to lower it a little better now it's on high that looks pretty crispy keep it hit by them the onion should not crisp it should kind of melt yes soften oh okay you know add a little salt it'll help soften it you taught me this and I do it actually design I'm an open it see it because it makes it sweat and you probably make this with whole Tomatoes right hold can tomatoes yes I make it with crushed will leave okay all right so we're ready for the tomatoes no we're gonna put the vinegar in it first there's your vinegar you make messy sena without vinegar I don't would Victor why would I a visitor in Rome there's two schools do either do it with a glass of vinegar or you do it with a glass of white wine I guess we're out of wine how can you make my vision without wine red pepper that I have oh and by the way that was your wine so I can finish my no that's mine no it is dead how much pepper you want one pinch yeah okay once this blows my add some salt yeah okay we'll grab that really teaching yeah I did I fried the garbanzo beans they're good right hmm aren't they good it's delicious I've never had them fried all right so added some salt to the pack why do you put fine salt in your pasta water actually this is kosher salt why didn't you put rough Saul um sometimes I do but I have kosher salts and just add a little bit more and I figure it's the same thing no I was just curious if it was something I didn't know that I had to learn because we in Italy with what rock something I know but then I'm buying rock salt just for the water kosher salt to cook with fine salt for badness figure it's too many salt so just gonna use the kosher salt from the water and everything else and then the clients all just when I'm baking I don't find it changes the flavor that much can I have this sauce now is that a yes good just a minute all right so you have the sauce I'm gonna go grab my meatballs does that do that okay all right I made these special meatballs whoops I made these earlier I love meat bones what do you think didn't put any ketchup in there did you know I'd never do that ketchup why would I catch it with my meatballs I don't that's I don't know you don't put vinegar in your messy Sharna never oh please ketchup not me me to the intro yeah go for it all right well I'm gonna bake those off at 400 degrees for 15 minutes I'm surprised you didn't say anything about cooking them because traditionally you know you don't bake them high do you do battle Madonna oh is that it it should be pink it should not be grand so half of a can of tomato sauce so now I gotta put that away yay do something else with us make us cool for all right I'll take care of this we'll put in a container and I'll save it for later I'm ready to throw some past in here yeah you okay okay and I'm not gonna throw very much it's just you and me yeah and see they have little holes in the center it's nice and thick thicker than a spaghetti okay so I'm gonna throw this I'm gonna give it a quick here can I borrow this yeah all right so that's gonna take 10 10 minutes or so my meatballs 15 minutes and when we're done we can put it all together right all right so just do it for the cook I keep drinking okay so Raffy may be done but I still have some more ideas on making this classic Roman dish extra special

I love cooking with herbs for my garden so I'm gonna pick a little bit of basil for the stuffing of my zucchini blossoms and a little bit of mint since I'm here and I'm gonna need it later on nice bunch of fresh mint perfect the table is set and it's the most beautiful setting and I made these little party favors for everybody I potted little herbs in little pots so that way everybody could take them home I think it's gonna be really fun I think my friends are gonna love it I am so excited my bundt cakes have been cooling for 15 minutes and I have a little trick to getting them out what I do is I take a baking sheet put a piece of parchment paper between the baking sheet and the fun kicks and then I invert it just like that and you let them sit for about an hour and that way the pineapple on the bottom gets to soak into the cakes they're gonna be beautiful so while that happens I've already started heating up my oil medium heat for a few minutes until it's nice and hot at 350 the meantime let's start on the filling for my zucchini blossoms so use 1/3 cup goat cheese and just use about half of this right here and you want to bring the cheese to room temperature just because it makes it easier afterwards to kind of mix up then I need a little bit of cream cheese so I do a mixture of goat cheese and cream cheese it's always been my favorite the goat cheese has a nice tartness to it and then the cream cheese is creamier and a little Tang the combination together very tasty so 2 tablespoons of cream cheese and some basil fresh basil I just picked and this is kind of like the garden I bring the garden flavors to my filling it just gives a real lightness to it and you should use any fresh herbs that you grow in fact my aunt Raffy has this big little garden behind her house I sometimes go to her house pick it and bring it home especially when she's out of town Basil's in now a little bit of salt and a little bit of ground black pepper now with a little bit more flavoring grab some green onions and heavy cream and some sparkling water so we're gonna need a little bit of cream to sort of loosen up the mixture and make it easier to mix this up and about two teaspoons one green onion now I like the flavor of onion but I want it nice and mild in the filling so I'm only gonna use one of them just cut off the end there and then I like to chop it kind of fine and so that way Fries up in the filling really well nice now kind of want to mix this all together and see because the cheese is soft it just what's up so nicely it looks like it's fresh from the garden done now I want to get started on the batter so god I'm going to use one cup of sparkling water I like the effervescence from the sparkling water rather than using regular tap water see other little bubbles they make for a very light batter and that's what you want there we go and some flour cut the flour just dump that right in there grab a whisk and just kind of whisk it all together and see how it bubbles up that's what you want okay so now I need my zucchini blossoms so I got these at the farmers market and the great thing about these is how beautiful they are and also you know they're not been shipped in from anywhere even if you buy them at the grocery store because they don't last that long so what I do is I just open the little flower part of the leaf up and I take a little ice cream spoon you see how small it is so you take a little bit of the filling and it's perfect because it's the perfect size to fit inside here and then I just kind of leave it in there you want to be gentle because they break pretty easily and then what I do is I wrap the top just like that then I drop it in the batter and you just kind of want to mix it around a little bit so it just covers it there we go and then just take off some of the excess batter and then drop it in and they fry for just a couple of minutes you get nice and golden brown you're looking pretty oh so pretty and I just want to put them on from paper towel just drain off any of the extra oil that might be on them there we go and I also like to season them with a little bit of salt when they're still hot let's grab that one that was trying to get away from me put your napkin ah okay now a little bit of salt while they're hot because that way the oil absorbs the salt all right so I'm gonna finish frying the rest of my zucchini blossoms and then I'll get started on my father bean puree a delicate topping to a delicious main course
hello I need a little support clams Casino is an elegant and classic bite-sized Italian appetizer Little Neck clams are topped with a savory vegetable and punch it to blend and baked with a Parmesan cheese topping each shell holds a tender blend of flavors so good you'll want to savor each one I like to add a little veggie topping to my clams Casino and of course a little pancetta now when this dish was first created in a restaurant called casino in New York City they just topped the the clams with a strip of bacon I'm gonna make it a little more Italian by adding pancetta and some veggies but they're perfect because they're bite-sized you just pop them in your mouth they're so tasty they're so gourmet and they don't take any time at all to make just like that and that's just gonna take a couple minutes so basically the same idea as bacon you're just gonna crisp it up and then it'll add little bits of crispy whites salty little bites to the filling so that it's nice and crispy does it think I'm gonna prep the rest of my veggies I'm gonna add a couple cloves of garlic of course it adds a lot of flavor to the filling so a little bit of garlic shallots and what I love about shallots is they're milder and flavor they're still part of the onion family but they're a little more delicate and this is you know a little delicate appetizer so we're gonna use delicate flavors and that's what shallots give you the same oniony flavor but a little bit milder so we're just gonna slice our shallots okay just like that and you put these around the table and you've always got people that are so excited and they feel like you're really treating them to a great little plate of food with the clams all right smooth these over to the our bowl and we'll let that cool while we make the filling add the olive oil there we go and of course all the flavors on the pancetta that just browned are gonna be in the films we're gonna cook the shallots and the garlic in all of that a little bit of salt bring out all the natural moisture that's in there don't be afraid a little smoke it's good flavor and they're cooking away now we're gonna add red pepper and what I love about the red pepper is the color obviously but the crunch red peppers they've got that nice crunch to them or add pepper straight in see that as a little redness texture in color yummy you have to think when you make these little dishes at a party you want all sorts of different flavors and textures there's something for everyone I'm thinking nibble on satay for just a minute or a little bit of pepper right over the bed add a little bit of white wine basically to pick up all the flavors from the pancetta when we brown the punch it out a little brown bits it also adds a depth of flavor to the filling some oregano just a couple pinches of oregano it's a little bit peppery a little bit lemony that's actually a warmth of flavor to the filling okay and the vegetables just absorb the flavors of the wine it's just yummy and you can smell it mmm so you have a little extra white wine in your fridge just pop a little bit in there and if not you could add a little bit of clam juice to give it that same depth of flavor all righty our filling is ready it's gonna cool and when it's completely cooled I'm gonna add some Parmesan cheese because I don't want to add the hot stuffing to the cold clams so I want this completely cooled add some cheese in the meantime I'm gonna clean my clams I'm just adding some rock salt to my baking sheet that I've actually lined with foil it creates a nice flat surface the shells to lay on as they bake and I had my fish person shuck the clams for me and give me the clams and if you do some shells that way it makes for really pretty presentation people just pick them up and just pop them in the mouth go alright time to clean off the clams they're pretty sand free grit free usually but you want to make double sure rinse them off now we're gonna fill each shell this is gonna be so good perfect I bet my filling this cool so I'm gonna top it with the filling and then pop them in the up so now it's time to add the Parmesan cheese you'll see the Parmesan cheese will absorb all the liquid wine and you liquid from the vegetables makes it nice and crude spoon a little bit on top of each lamb and it adds a beautiful beautiful color on top of the clams and it's gonna add some great flavor chip we're gonna top with a little bit more Parmesan cheese we need to drizzle a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil it adds a little bit more moisture to create that nice golden crust on top okay we're ready to put it in the oven 500 degrees for about 12 minutes
I love to travel and recently my husband Todd and I went to Paris on vacation we had an amazing time god I love it up here I thought it'd be really fun to recreate the experience with an evening filled with all the great food and memories we had and we're on our trip to him having deja so check out my menu we'll start with my fresh mushroom and parsley salad it's simple and satisfying then my Parisian steak and cheese croissant sandwiches there's a story behind this one the cheese is traditional mistake not so much and a very fancy dessert raspberry rose pasta creme riche and delicious with a distinctly floral flavor table we may be in California but we'll always have Paris I remember that when I lived in Paris years ago there was this cute little gelato stand tucked away behind notre Dom so when Todd and I were on vacation there recently we took some time to find it and what I loved about this gelato was that they had these wonderful floral flavors especially their raspberry rose it's almost perfuming it was my inspiration for my raspberry rose puffed Eclair so I've just smashed my raspberries 3/4 of a cup of fresh yummy raspberries I'm gonna go grab a milk and cream here and basically pot de creme is just pudding in French so that's what we're gonna make it's gonna be really yummy and I think town's gonna really find it fun and the best part is there's a real treat at the end and hopefully Tom remember it when he has it in fact I know he will cuz it's probably one of the best desserts we ever had in Paris so 1/2 a cup of milk we're just gonna heat up the milk and the cream and then 3/4 of a cup of cream there we go and it's great because you can flavor this whatever you want and I happen to love puddings so I think the flavors in here will be very reminiscent of Paris now I also need some rose water now the rose water is really where the flavors come in so when we went to the gelato place I had a raspberry rosewater gelato so I am just gonna add half a teaspoon cuz it's pretty strong I just want to heat this up just like medium-low heat you just want the milk and the cream to basically heat up with the rose water so it infuses the flavor in it so we'll leave that and we're gonna start with the eggs so we're gonna need some egg yolks this is rich but it sure is good so I'm just gonna separate the eggs we need four yolks to make this there we go and I think what's so great about traveling is the ability to kind of bring it back home so that when you're home and you haven't been able to travel for a while you can kind of recreate all those memories and I think that's so much fun especially for me and for Todd right now because without a little baby it's kind of hard to go anywhere cuz she's too little so when we're missing Paris all we have to do is recreate the dishes all right one more egg and separate it off and the egg yolks make it nice and creamy and you want to make sure and use room-temperature eggs because we're gonna add warm milk and cream to the egg yolks and if they were cold they get scrambled really easily and a quarter cup of sugar we'll just add that right in there and a pinch of salt just to bring out the flavors there we go a little whisk and just kind of mix it all together okay so sugar and egg yolks and a little salt and that's hot enough and you can see that the milks warm because you see little bubbles around the sides and you slowly add that right in there and just stir it around to cool it off there we go okay so we got that now the raspberries and the raspberries add this beautiful pink kind of tint to it really pretty and you'll see little bits of fresh raspberry in here too I can actually smell the rose water already it was beautiful scent to it now move over here I'll put those in the ramekins I just want to grab my ladle and just fill the ramekins just like that you see the little bits and you want to feel it about 3/4 of the way up it'll be good there we go so now just add some boiling water because we're gonna basically make a little water bath here and you want to fill the water about halfway up the ramekins and it'll keep it nice and moist we're gonna bake it at 350 for 30 minutes and then we're gonna chill them and then next I can make my favorite fresh mushroom salad that I had just about every day when I lived in Paris delicate slices of mushrooms and Parmesan cheese make this salad light delicious and full of flavor
well my mango cheesecake cools in the fridge I'm gonna get started on the topping what I want to do is add one cup of sugar and we're gonna make a simple syrup a lemon-basil simple syrup it's gonna be really good so one cup of sugar and a quarter cup of water and you just want to dissolve the sugar now to flavor it and to make it nice and lemony because I think lemon and mangos together are such a great combination I'm gonna add lemon juice about a quarter cup there we go okay we got that in there nice and lemony flavor perfect the sugars dissolved while that cools I'm gonna grab my cheesecake so now I'm gonna add basil leaves I'm just gonna help the blender by give them those quick little chop lets you cut into the basil that minty lemony smell it's so refreshing so good so you just add the basil right in there and you also add the cooled lemony simple syrup okay very cozy look how green it is oh it's all so good now at this point you could strain it if you wanted to but I love the little green bits so I'm gonna leave it it looks so gorgeous okay so now I'm gonna cut a slice and it's okay if it pours and comes over the edges you want it to do that that way you can see lots of color all right let's dig into this I love the basil simple syrup on top of that oh my god yeah my gosh it's so creamy mm-hmm and the mango puree is slightly sweet and then you got lemon basil simple syrup right on top a little bit of Tang you know the kitchen should be a place where you have fun and you can be creative and remember the more colorful the food the more flavorful it is
(peaceful soft music) - Alaska is kind of Wild West, you know. (peaceful soft music) I mean, everybody has their thing that they’re proud of, from where they come from. Ours is the wilderness, the animals, and the toughness. (peaceful soft music) My name is Libby Riddles, I've lived in Alaska for over 40 years. I was the first woman to win the Iditarod in 1985. (muffled barking) Alaskan huskies, they live to run. Gosh, you watch them just taking off and it's like, "Wow, what an adventure," you know? There's nothing really like it. So when I went into the 1985 Iditarod, I was living in an Eskimo village of 300 people, and we're racing against these big sponsored teams, and I was a total unknown. So about midway through the race, on the Yukon River, it was the coldest I'd practically ever mushed in. You know, that 60 below, still calm of the interior, and that's where I kind of made my move. I was in first place then. I got to the village of Shaktoolik, and it was really getting windy and stormy. (distant barking) And I'm thinking, people die out in these blizzards. But I've camped out in storms before; I know what I'm doing. My dog team's ready to do it. (film reel clicking) Let's go for it. (exciting music) When I left that checkpoint, I was like, "What are you doing, Miss Riddles? "This is really bad," you know, 'cuz you couldn't see for more than a marker. I mean, you can go through bad ice, so I had to have really a lot of trust in my dogs. I'm not scared or anything; I'm just surviving. (film reel clicks) (distant barking) I was out there for 24 hours, and all over the state of Alaska, people were like, "Where's Libby? What's going on?" And the mushers are back in the checkpoint in Shaktoolik, eating hot cakes and going, "God, I wonder if she's still alive out there." (white noise) Nobody left Shaktoolik the next morning til late, 'cuz they're having hot cakes and looking at the weather and stuff. I'd been sleeping in my sled, so I got up early. Oh, when I did make it over to the other side, I was thinking, I'm gonna kiss the snow bank, I'm never going out on the sea ice again. I was so happy. - [Narrator] Her bold move turned the rest of the race into a 170-mile victory lap, with Riddles' cruise to Nome and into the history books. I had never dreamed past the finish line. I had no idea it was gonna be a big deal like it was, you know, like a woman winning it. Of course, women are tough, everybody knows that, you know. (light laughter) (people cheering) I still have to pinch myself sometimes 'cuz I think anybody who finishes it has just accomplished something amazing. (distant cheering) I still have 20 dogs. I don't race anymore, but I run dogs all winter, and then for 16 years, I've been coming down here and sharing these stories with passengers for Princess Cruises. We're proud of these things that are part of our heritage, you know, like driving a dog team a thousand miles through Alaska in the middle of the winter. That's part of what makes us different, and I want to give people an authentic experience and to know that Alaska is still wild and we like it like that and if you come to Alaska, don't miss the sled dogs. (light laughter) (hopeful music)

here's the dish that takes you away from it all with this vibrant combination of flavors I blend gorgonzola and cream cheese and flavor them with fresh thyme then I layer slices of sweet sautéed pears and strips of salty prosciutto you'll love the perfect balance of flavors in this pear and gorgonzola tart the first thing I want to do from my parent or Gonzaga tart is slice 3 Bosc pears so I'm basically just gonna cut them in half and just core them so use a melon baller to help you core it just put that over there so easy that is and I like Bosc pears because they're nice and firm so when I cook them in the butter they're gonna stay intact do that take another one I'm just make slices okay now that I have all my pear sliced just wanna pick them up in a little bit of butter let's take the butter nice soft room-temperature butter I'll just melt the butter there we go now can add all of the sliced pear to the pan just like that and heat them up just give them more flavor and it makes this tart even better so we'll leave these in the pan for about five minutes or so it's while those cook I am gonna get my spread ready four ounces of cream cheese I love good old-fashioned regular cream cheese it whips up beautifully and for a little bit of a kick some Italian gorgonzola and Grogan's ol is from the Lombardy region and northern Italy and it's just got a a nice creamy texture to it a little bit of a salty bite and a little bit of a tang and for a little bit of freshness I'm going to add some fresh thyme and time is lemony so it adds a nice kick to the cheese's it gives a little bit of like a green speck and the cheese too so it looks really pretty so now I'm just going to sort of chop it just so the essential oils in its flavor and aroma really come out well and we can add it right on top now I'm going to blend it all together and the cream cheese whips up beautifully so it's really fun here as a blend that loosens up and becomes nice and creamy alright now just want to add a little bit of salt just ever so slightly because it goes into a little sharp so you don't want to add too much a little bit of pepper I'm gonna give this one more little whip just to incorporate the salt and the pepper there we go now I can sit my tart shell I baked in a little tart shell with a removable bottom and this is what it looks like and I love it because it gives it this little scalloped edges and it makes it look so elegant just get all the cheese and now with this offset spatula just go ahead and spread it all out and you just want a nice even thin layer I only did a little bit of cheese spread it all the way around perfect okay now pour the pears right over the crust and the pears will warm up the cheese as well I want to make it extra special so I'm going to use thinly cut for shoot that which is basically just Italian turd ham and I'm gonna slice it just a little slivers here you just sprinkle it right on top and it makes it into a meal you know you've got the sweetness from the pears with the tane is from the cheese and a little bit of that saltiness and prosciutto now cut a slice of tart and there we go perfect looks good so you want to get a little bit of pear and the crust and of course the prosciutto with the big bite mmm prepared are tender but there's still a little bit from it they still have a little bit of crunch to them a little bit of salty prosciutto it is the perfect lunch again with a little side salad and you're done
I'm making my biscotti crust for my brownie and walnut pie and I'm using 8 almond biscotti just breaking them up into pieces and then the food processor is gonna mix everything together and make a great little crust and then to that I want to add half a stick of unsalted chilled butter you want it to be nice and cold so it can bring together all the biscotti and we can get a nice mixture I'm just cutting the butter into cubes just to make it easier for the food processor to mix it all together break them all up in there we also need a quarter cup of dark brown sugar that way you get that molasses II sweetness that I really like in here blend it all together put all of the crumbs in the center of the pie dish and have a nine-inch pie dish here spread it out evenly and then press down with your fingers so we're gonna pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes until it's nice and golden brown and then I'm gonna get started on my brownie walnut filling I just melted three ounces of chocolate with six tablespoons of unsalted butter and look at this it looks like a little chocolate fountain so this is the beginning of the chocolate walnut filling for my pie we're gonna add one and a quarter cups of dark brown sugar I love that molasses flavor in here plus it makes a little sticky too we're just gonna mix this in now we're gonna add three eggs one at a time so just make sure that the eggs are at room temperature so now we need a little bit of flour we're gonna do three quarters of a cup give it a little bit of structure I'll mix that in there and when it bakes in the oven everything melts into everything else so don't worry if you have a few lumps it's okay all gonna melt and be really good we're gonna add a little bit of salt just a quarter teaspoon of salt to even out all of the sweetness and now half a cup of toasted walnuts that I chopped they add a nice crunch texture in the inside so now grab our baking sheet and here is the biscotti crust pour the filling right inside oh yeah nice and decadent I'm just gonna pour a few walnuts you don't want to toast them because they're gonna toast in the oven when we bake this and you create a little decoration all around the sides and you put them all around the edges of the pie and then you bake the pie see how pretty that looks so I'm gonna pop it in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes until the top firms up but the inside is still sort of gooey and chewy this is gonna be really good

you I'm making my opinion with traveese and goat cheese and the pin they're perfect because they're easy to eat it's short pasta so it makes it really easy when you want to eat it on the go while the pin to cook I'm gonna get started on the sauce it's gonna be a nice sauce made of spinach and Trevizo which is kind of like radicchio and goat cheese so bad 1/4 cup or so there we go and 1 clove of garlic not a lot just one club because I already put garlic in the chicken salad too so I don't want too much garlic in the pasta I don't want us to smell really bad so we're gonna infuse a little bit of olive oil with some garlic the minute you start smelling the garlic heat up that's time to take it out so let's grab the Trevizo the spinach and the goat cheese there we go we'll use the goat cheese in a little bit and I found this fantastic chorizo and Trevizo is basically it's like radicchio it's just a different shape then then ridiculous and the leaves are not quite as bitter but it still has a bit of a bite to it so what I like to do is saute it because it mellows out the flavor and we're going to saute it with a little balsamic vinegar which I'll sweeten it up just a little bit because most people think of radicular Trevizo only in salads but it's actually really good if you saute it because it just tenderizes it it makes it slightly sweeter well here we go with the garlic once you smell the garlic it's done there we go and we'll add the Trevizo right in here and if you can't find Trevizo well you can just use radicchio or really any kind of lettuce you like I just love the texture of the Trevizo and the spinach together a little bit of salt and some pepper then some baby spinach leaves I like the color combination we're adding lots of greens to our food today and the other great thing about all these greens is that they really hold up well when you pack them up give it a quick little stir already the trees are starting to cook down a little bit I'm going to add some chicken stock and some balsamic so let's start with the balsamic just sweeten up the Trevizo about a quarter cup or so of balsamic sweetness intensifies as it cooks down so it really does flavor them sweeten both the spinach and the Trevizo and half a cup of chicken broth and the chicken broth flavors it creates a little bit of a sauce and helps soften the leaves do that I give it a little mix here and let it cook down and we also want to add some lemon juice we use some lemon zest in the chicken salad and now we're gonna add some lemon juice about two tablespoons or so and if you have a juicy lemon you can get that out of half a lemon if not use a whole lemon so now let's taste the pasta let's see if we're ready for the pasta doesn't look like it but let's try it one more minute and that's gonna be dumb grab our bowl need to grab the basil because we're gonna top the pasta with some fresh basil you want to add it right at the end because it's fresh and it's delicate you want to call those yummy flavors but now it's ready I'm gonna add some red pepper flakes so just a pinch of red pepper flakes just like that not too spicy but you want a little bit of kick of flavor and especially when you're cooking with lots of veggies it's nice to add some red pepper flakes because it really gives the dish that POW it's fun for your taste buds is what I always say okay time for the pasta and then we'll also add the cheese there's the pin Nick yep that one got away add the pin and right into the sauce once you add the pasta and you kind of want to lower the heat a little bit and you want the pasta to be al dente I never really checked to make sure mm-hmm come on have a little bit of a bite inside I can't make a pasta without adding some cheese so we're going to add about one and a half cups of powder my channel my channel that we also used earlier in the arugula pesto and I like to add it before we add the pasta water just to see because Parmesan cheese kind of absorbs some of the liquid as well yeah we're gonna need a little pasta water cuz you want it to be you know have a little bit of a sauce in just the little pasta water not too much a couple ladlefuls that starchiness from the pasta water really works well to create a sauce on this pasta and as the pasta cools to it'll continue to absorb a little bit take all that and make goodness out of there we're gonna put it in the bowl and the reason we're doing this is because I need to cool the pasta down before I can pack it you don't want to pack it up when it's really hot so now time to add the fresh basil see right on top and the pasta warms it through that doesn't get cooked which is good and the goat cheese and the goat cheese creates such creaminess in this pasta one and a half cups of fresh goat cheese there we go cut it in half I just take it and I kind of just crumble it right on top and with good goat cheese you can do that and then it melts into the pasta and creates this creamy creamy sauce and goat cheese is so mild you know gives a little bit of a tart flavor and give it a quick little toss just like that and see the hot pasta will melt the goat cheese and it becomes a nice creamy sauce it's so good and I can smell ah the balsamic okay so I'm going to pop this in the fridge so it can cool down before I pack it up and up next I'm gonna make the best breakfast smoothie ever for our road trip it's really going to fuel us up and look at that gorgeous color it's sweet creamy and irresistible you want to add it right at the end because it's fresh and it's delicate you want to cook all those yummy flavors but now it's ready I'm gonna add some red pepper flakes so just a pinch of red pepper flakes just like that not too spicy but you want a little bit of kick of flavor and especially when you're cooking with lots of veggies it's nice to add some red pepper flakes because it really gives the dish that POW it's fun for your taste buds is what I always say okay time for the pasta and then we'll also add the cheese there's the pendant that one got away add the pin and right into the sauce once you add the pasta and you kind of want to lower the heat a little bit and you want the pasta to be al dente I never really checked to make sure mm-hmm try to have a little bit of a bite inside I can't make a pasta without adding some cheese so we're gonna cook down a little bit I'm gonna add some chicken stock and some balsamic so let's start with the balsamic just sweeten up the Trevizo about 1/4 cup or so of balsamic sweetness intensifies as it cooked down so it really does flavor and sweeten both the spinach and the Trevizo and 1/2 a cup of chicken broth and the chicken broth flavors it creates a little bit of a sauce and helps soften the leaves that I give it a little mix here and let it cook down and we also want to add some lemon juice we use some lemon zest in the chicken salad and now we're gonna add some lemon juice about 2 tablespoons or so and if you have a juicy lemon you can get that out of half a lemon if not use a whole lemon so now let's taste the pasta let's see if we're ready for the pasta doesn't look like it but let's try it one more minute and that's gonna be dumb grab our bolt need to grab the basil because we're gonna top the pasta with some fresh basil I'm making my pinning with traveese and goat cheese and the pin they're perfect because they're easy to eat it's short pasta so it makes it really easy when you want to eat it on the go while the pin Nick cook I'm going to get started on the sauce it's gonna be a nice sauce made of spinach and Teresa which is kind of like radicchio and goat cheese so bad 1/4 cup or so there we go and 1 clove of garlic not a lot just one club because I already put garlic in the chicken salad too so I don't want too much garlic in the pasta I don't want us to smell really bad so we're gonna infuse a little bit of olive oil with some garlic the minute you start smelling the garlic heat up that's time take it out so let's grab the Trevizo the spinach and the goat cheese there we go we'll use the goat cheese in a little bit and I found this fantastic

we'll add the Trevizo right in here and if you can't find some usable you can just use radicchio or really any kind of lettuce you like I just love the texture of the Trevizo and the spinach together a little bit of salt and some pepper then some baby spinach leaves I like the color combination we're adding lots of greens to our food today and the other great thing about all these greens is that they really hold up well when you pack them up give it a quick little stir already the trees are starting to add about one and a half cups of parmigiano-reggiano that we also used earlier in the arugula pesto and I like to add it before we add the pasta water just to see because Parmesan cheese kind of absorbs some of the liquid as well yeah we're going to need a little pasta water because you want it to be you know have a little bit of a sauce in just a little pasta water not too much a couple ladlefuls that starching is from the pasta water really works well to create a sauce on this pasta and as the pasta cools too it'll continue to absorb a little bit get all that and make goodness out of there we're gonna put it in the bowl and the reason we're doing this is because I need to cool the pasta down before I can pack it you don't want to pack it up when it's really hot so now time to add the fresh basil see right on top and the pasta warms it through that doesn't get cooked which is good and the guilty
the bouncer I prefer that quick my doorman like me choose right twinks
all right so I finished my lemon lime custard and I put it over an ice bath basically a bowl of ice just to cool it down because if it's too hot I can't add the whipped cream to it it'll just melt with the whipped cream this is the kind of consistency you want from your custard kind of like a pudding all right so now to flavor it I'm gonna add lemon zest and lime zest we just can't get enough of that lemon lime flavor so lemon zest okay get that all in there and the lime zest that's a really pretty color get all of that lime zest in there so perfumey there we go so now just give it a quick little mix so you can see all the little bits from the lime and a lemon in the custard very pretty okay so it's cooled down enough now move the ice bath then we're ready to add the whipped cream so I just took one cup of heavy cream and added a quarter cup of sugar to it and what you want to do is add a little bit of whipped cream to the custard at a time you want to fold it and just using your spatula mix the custard and the whipped cream together that way you get a nice Airy consistency you want to make sure not overmix otherwise you won't get back nice light fluffy nests afterwards here we go so now I take a metal loaf pan I spray it with cooking spray and then I line it with plastic wrap so now I should just pour it right into a loaf pan see how thick that is okay just like that okay now I pop it in the freezer for eight hours and then we get to slice it and eat it all right I see me fade those frozen it's been eight hours and I just want to take the plastic off and I take my platter and I'm just gonna invert the semifreddo there we go and remember it's a half frozen dessert that is why it's called a semifreddo okay for a little crunch which is what I always like on my frozen dessert I'm gonna add some comedy cookies these are just waiting really airy and crunchy almond cookies and I just kind of break them right on top just like that not too many just a little bit just put a little bit of crunch there we go feel free oh my goodness the MRT cookies are awesome the best thing about these dishes is you don't have to go to a steakhouse to have the perfect steak dinner in fact if you make it at home you can put your own final touches on it and give yourself the best meal ever

so I have to granny smith apples for my roasted apple pies with whipped cream so i cut the apples in half after I've peeled them and then I'm gonna slice them again just like that I'm gonna cut all the core out of all of these there we go these are really fun this is kind of a really easy way to make apple pie and second Apple now it wouldn't be apple pies with a little cinnamon sugar so we're gonna do a tablespoon of cinnamon and a quarter cup of sugar I love cinnamon it's so comforting then I take a fork and I kind of just mix it all together perfect so now I take all of the apples and take a spoon and just toss all the apples in the cinnamon sugar just make sure cuz they kind of stick together sometimes to separate the apple slices so that all the cinnamon sugar coats over each Apple and then you bake them and make sugar caramelizes on the baking sheet and they get like this dark golden brown color there we go that's perfect so now I grab my baking sheet and I've line a baking sheet with a Silpat a Silpat is just a silicone coated baking sheet that nothing sticks to but you can always use parchment paper if you want to and then I just take the apples and just kind of line them up like that okay so now we've got all of our apples I know what glob I love apples and cinnamon all right so let's pop this in a 400 for about 12 to 15 minutes until they're nice and dark brown and the sugar is caramelized let's grab the pie crust out of the fridge I got my whipping cream too so I can make whipped cream later on so now I've got my pie crust and I'm totally cutting a corner obviously by buying pie crust but these days they have really good pie price at the store son this just makes my life a little easier I take a three-inch cookie cutter and we're just gonna cut little discs out of it and we should get eight little disks seven and eight and just lay them on and again this baking sheet is also lined with a Silpat so that the pie crust doesn't stick to it there we go and we're gonna bake these off at 400 degrees as well and the trick here is that you don't want to put the pie crust in the oven with the apples cuz the apples have a lot of moisture and it's not good for pastry to cook in an oven where there's a lot of moisture otherwise it'll get soggy and you won't have these nice crisp little discs and you just want to use the fork and prick the top of the pie discs because you don't want them to rise too much you want to be nice and thin perfect so we'll pop this in the lower oven and those are gonna bake for about eight to ten minutes until they're light and golden brown so now we get rid of this and we start with the whipped cream my bowl a measuring cup and a little beater here so whipped cream 1/2 a cup of whipping cream can't really have apple pie without some whipped cream you just got to have it so we'll do some whipping cream let's start whipping it up alright time for the powdered sugar and it's just a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar add that right in there and the powdered sugar is nice and fine so it kind of dissolves in the whip cream really well so let's mix that in whipped cream is done nice stiff peaks I'm nice and sweet too this is good all right I'm gonna leave this in the fridge so it stays nice and cold Karolina should be here any minute and then we're gonna put this all together and have a great lunch

while I was waiting for the butter to melt I got a head start on my lobster tails and basically all I did was take a pair of scissors and cut down the back of the lobster just like this and then I take a metal skewer and I just run it down right the bottom side just like that that way the lobster tails aren't gonna curl up so it's going to look really pretty and basically by taking the scissors and cutting down the back of the lobster it makes it easier to eat later on and when I brush it with a lemon butter it kind of seeps into the lobster all right so I'm doubled by lobsters I'm going to wash my hands okay so now I'll show you a little trick there grab a spoon and now that the butter is melted you can see that the milk solids separate from the butter fat and they rise to the top kind of like a floating iceberg so you just basically skim it off the top just like that we'll grab a measuring cup and I pour the melted butter into the measuring cup and you let it cool for a couple minutes and then when it's cooled you'll see that all the the remaining milk solids will be at the bottom so you just pour it and leave that in there in the meantime when I get my lemons three lemons and we're gonna zest three lemon because we're gonna really infuse the lemon into the butter grab zester and here we go it kind of enhances the flavor of the lobster not traditional but citrusy and bright and super yummy that's it we got lots and lots of lemon zest here okay these three and we pour the melted butter on top of the lemon zest and when you pour it you just don't want to pour the whole thing and then that's it cuz all the milk solids whatever was left over is settled on the bottom so you don't to use that and the heat from the butter brings out the flavor in the lemon zest and it makes it nice and lemony there we go okay now show you what I do I take a lobster tail put it down on the tinfoil and I pour some of the warm lemon butter right over the top and then I like to open up the shell just a little bit just like that and kind of brush the lemon butter right inside of it just so it really soaks into the lobster meat that way when it cooks it's gonna be so good succulent and it's gonna have that lemony buttery kind of flavor to it there we go okay pat down and wrap the lobster tail all right I'm gonna get the rest finished up you prepped and then some packing tips to make this lobster bake elegant easy and fun
pastina maybe the most kid-friendly pasta because it's small and comes in fun shapes I'm going to mix it with sauteed chicken and vegetables then bake it with a cheesy Parmesan crust on top the kids will love baked chicken and piscina and so will you while Charlie and Lucy play outside I'm going to make the perfect lunch for them my Italian pastina with chicken so first thing I want to do is just salt my water for the pasta now pastina just means little pasta so it can be any shape it can be these elbow macaroni which I just love we're just gonna throw in there we go and they puff up so you don't need that much we'll let these cook and because the pasta is so small it only takes about five or six minutes to cook so while that cooks I'm gonna hit my skillet and we're gonna cook some chicken so we're gonna add some chicken to the pastina then bake it with cheese it's gonna be a hit I know I loved it as a kid something that you can make in advance and then just reheat it later on if you need to it you can make a whole bunch like just a big baking dish full so I'm just gonna add the chicken to my frying pan and you just want to brown the chicken a little bit not high in the meantime I am going to just use half an onion and a little bit of garlic just one clove my mom used to make this kind of dish for us and we're your kids absolutely loved it it's one of the ultimate comfort food for us you can smell it all over the house too perfect and what kid doesn't love cheesy pasta dish they always do turn that around and the chicken will finish cooking in the oven with the pasta you just want to give it a little bit of flavor where I browning it in the pan just a bit here there we go then you just add the onions and the garlic a little bit and just saute that just until the onions becomes soft and you can smell the garlic the kill the other all right while that cooks it's time for me to grate all the cheese so we're just going to take the box grater and some what's that like just a little bit more to go perfect so now we've got the mozzarella and let's see about the chicken chickens just about ready and let's check the pasta the pasta should be ready and you just want to cook it until mmm no but under al dente five minutes or so and it's ready to go perfect passed ready now I'm going to add the chicken the onions and the garlic a little bit goes a long way with all of this at all of the mozzarella right on top and see already the hot pasta is melting the mozzarella yummy and we're also going to add some fresh flat-leaf parsley so parsley and some tomatoes gotta add some tomatoes again color and also the tomatoes help keep the pasta from sticking to each other as well so we're just gonna add a can of tomatoes see how pretty that is you don't have to worry about it all being cooked completely because it's gonna finish cooking in the oven and I want to add a little bit of salt and just a little bit of trackbar pepper just attack that's it not too much mmm my gosh look at the mozzarella all melted in there so good now I just want to put it in my buttered baking dish I'm just gonna put it all in there this is the secret on top are you store-bought breadcrumbs what I love about them is they're nice and dry so they make for a nice crisp crust on top and we are going to add some Padme jello dijanna right on top and my family we all love cheese so we always add quite a bit of cheese mix these two together and then just sprinkle it right over the top just like that and ever wonder how you get it to be golden brown I just add a little bit of soft butter right over the top and the bread crumbs absorb the butter and that creates a wonderfully golden crust crispy and kind of buttery it's so good I'm going to bake this at 400 degrees for 30 minutes you

it's time to get started my potatoes and I'm making bacon and punch eat the potatoes I love pancetta but Karolina loves bacon so I thought I would infuse both of those flavors in here and I always have to chip it in my fridge in my freezer and I kind of portion it out like this so I can use it whenever I need it in soups and stews and sauces I really like it and it's different from bacon in that it's not smoked like bacon is and has a little less fat and it's also flavored is usually peppercorns in it sometimes even pistachios and so I'm just cutting up the punch it into little cubes so that I can put it in the skillet and just kind of get it all crispy it's gonna render all the fat and then we're gonna cook the potatoes okay I can't think of anything better and Karolina loves or potatoes so then what I just take the bacon and just kind of cut it in little slices here then we're gonna turn it around and tape it there we go let's add all the bacon in there you want the pan about medium-high heat and it takes a couple minutes for all the fat to get rendered and get them nice and crispy so while those cook just start it on the potatoes and we also need a little garlic so let's start peeling our potatoes all right last potato there we go so potatoes are done all right we need a little bit of garlic just one clove is plenty and I'm gonna slice the garlic so that way it can infuse in the potatoes I don't want too much garlic just a little bit just to flavor the potatoes and just slice it up hello Joe so now potatoes are done garlic is done let's check on this bacon and pancetta grab my plate I just want to line a plate with some paper towel just so all of the extra fat can kind of go into the paper towel look how golden brown and crispy this looks I want to just spoon them out with a slotted spoon because I want to hold on to the fat in the pan so I can cook the potatoes in it there's no better way to add lots of flavor to them and to cook them in the rendered fat perfect so let that cool down over here meantime we're gonna add the garlic infused some garlic in there and start cutting out the potatoes and basically just cut them up in cubes about 1/2 inch or so remember the smaller you cut them the faster they cook a little salt a little pepper you want to season them with it great flavor give them a quick little toss the potatoes gonna take about 20 minutes to cook until the outsides nice and crispy in the insides nice and soft who the potatoes looks so good nice and crispy golden brown okay so I grab some time for my backyard and really all I want to do is take the time and just strip off the leaves it's really easy nice and lemony and fragrant and the thyme kind of holds up really well with the potato it's a really Hardy herb and of course that wonderful color give it a quick billster be careful not to break up the potatoes those look good I'm gonna take the cool punch it then bacon put it back in there nice so good nice and crispy salty that nice salty bite okay and grab our bolt turn off the heat and there we go how good does that look well salt all right potatoes are done so up next I have the best welcome home dessert my roasted apple pies with whipped creme good old-fashioned American favorite with a sweet and whimsical twist
alright so the chicken is cooked and I've just added some spices in here some dried herbs onion little garlic and white meat chicken so now to thicken this up a little bit I'm gonna add three tablespoons of flour it's gonna thicken the chili and that's what we want and what I want to do is add the flower before I add any liquid to it because I wouldn't just cook at all that raw flour flavor just for a minute here you can already see the chickens starting to get a little thick already so now time for the cannellini beans I've been talking about they're creamy and yummy so we're gonna add two fifteen ounce cans of keneley tea beans that I've already drained and rinsed when they're in the can they have a little extra salt you just want to rinse that out give that a quick little stir oh it's looking good all right so now a little color and because Todd loves corn I'm gonna add a little bit of corn in here about one and a half cups and I just thought it out see it's nice and pretty little corn kernels they'll be really yummy give that a little stir there we go now a little kick and a little seat I'm gonna have a quarter teaspoon of red pepper flakes if you don't want the chili to be too spicy add the red pepper flakes right at the end but Todd likes a little heat in this chili so we're gonna add it right now and let it cook give that a little stir and time for a little greenery so I found some beautiful Swiss chard at the store and I've already washed it and I happen to love Swiss chard it's in the beet and spinach family so we can always you know substitute with beet greens or spinach if you want and I just take the rib that's right in the center here and I just cut it out the ribs are perfectly good to eat but they take a lot longer to break down and they don't get us tender as the leaves do so I just cut them out and I just use the leaves it adds a nice texture and you kind of feel like you get you know a little bit of everything you need right in every single part of the chili so I take all the leaves together just kind of scrunch them up and then just chop them up just like that and they'll just wilt down with the chili I scoop one and just like spinach it looks like a lot but when it wilts down it's not much a little bit more salt just to flavor each layer that we're adding to the chili you gotta love chili everything in one pot everything in one bite it's so easy to cook and it's so yummy so lastly we're gonna add some chicken broth so 4 cups of low-sodium chicken broth and I like to use low-sodium just so I can control how much salt is in my chili and if you're using beef that you can just add beef broth or of course you can always add water but add a little more salt than cuz you need to add more flavor to it and just again get a little stir the Chili's gonna cook for about 50 minutes to an hour until it gets nice and thick and all the flavors can marry together so this is a really good time for me to go set up dinner by the fireplace tonight target's back it's all ready to go me mmm it smells so good it's really getting there it's getting nice and thick all right up next I'm going to show you the perfect crusty cheesy garlicky bread then we're gonna serve with this chili it is gonna be perfect gooey chewy and insanely delicious you
so todd and i got married 10 years ago some friends of ours threw us a beautiful rehearsal dinner the one thing that kind of stood out to me was the cocktail that we had I did a grapefruit Bellini very light very satisfying and that works for both men and women it was probably my favorite thing about the rehearsal dinner my nerves took the best of me and I didn't remember a whole heck of a lot but I do remember how much I loved that drink I'm feeling my grapefruit for my grapefruit and thyme Bellinis these are very festive cocktails and what I'm doing is I'm cutting the ends so I can get a stable sort of grapefruit so I can start to just peel the grapefruit with my knife and what you want to do is just follow the flesh of the grapefruit and cut off the skin and expose a beautiful pink grapefruit and I love pink grapefruit scuzz they're nice and sweet we're done awesome okay let me show you how you segment this looks a little more daunting than it actually is I take a paring knife and I just cut in between the membrane so that I end up with this beautiful little jewel of a grapefruit segments so pretty when you float them at the bottom of the champagne flutes we have a bowl underneath to catch the segment's or also to catch the juice because we're going to use the juice of the grapefruit in the actual drink so now you want to take a few of the segments drop them in the champagne flutes there we go and I'm gonna do a few in here and then a few the last one we're gonna set this aside and we're gonna cut this grapefruit squeeze all the juice out I love freshly squeezed grapefruit juice so yummy perfect this was a juicy one and now we're just gonna pour the grapefruit juice through a fine mesh strainer just to catch any seeds or anything like that that could be in there okay next we're going to add the simple syrup so I made as an easy little simple syrup half a cup of sugar half a cup of water and a whole bunch of time I brought the sugar water up to a boil and then I turned off the heat and I just let it all come down to room temperature it infused the simple syrup with a time flavor nice and citrusy a little bit early now a bottle of Italian Prosecco and Prosecco tends to be a little bit sweeter not quite as dry as champagne a little bit lighter too so we're gonna open this up oh yeah good good good and then we pour it gently and carefully right into the pitcher and see the color is so pretty as well then I take a glass and here we go isn't that nice look at the beautiful little jewels and grapefruit it's so refreshing slightly sweet with a little Irby lemony flavor from the time and that sweetness from the pink grapefruit I taste as good as it looks it's been fun going down memory lane with all of these recipes and now chichi

some of the most delicious flavors in Italy can be found in rustic old-fashioned country cooking simple ingredients and bold flavors make these dishes easy and delicious colourful chicken cacciatore with peppers onions and garlic simmered and wine smash parmesan potatoes no fuss just flavor crunchy lemon parsley bruschetta that will make your lips pucker for more and sweet crisp chocolate anise cookies rustic Italian cooking means a down-home dinner Italian style you the licorice essence of anise is a traditional flavoring in after-dinner cookies I add one of my favorite ingredients chocolate to these light and luscious treats pour yourself an espresso and sit back with the timeless flavor of chocolate Anna's cookies you'll recognize these cookies there would be Scottie but my version of biscotti and the first thing you want to start with are our dry ingredients so we're gonna use about two cups of all-purpose flour go and now we need one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and the baking powder will basically allow the cookies to rise so you know how biscotti tend to be a little bit thicker like that that's what the baking powder does and a quarter teaspoon of salt just regular table salt all right now we're just gonna mix the dry ingredients together and I'm just doing that so that I don't get any big clumps of either baking soda or salt in the cookie dry ingredients are ready so now we need the butter I'm using one stick of butter which is half a cup and 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar and we're going to whip it together and we're gonna basically cream the butter and the sugar together and what it kind of does is melt the sugar so that you don't you don't actually taste the sugar in your mouth and you want to start with room temperature butter it makes it easier to whip up together these cookies originated in Sardinia and they traditionally made just with annecy but I like to add chocolate chips to mine for little extra sweetness I'm going to add one egg at a time so we're going to add two eggs one at a time because you want to make sure and incorporate the egg properly a little bit at a time you know baking is a precise art so it's not a little bit of this a little bit of that like it isn't regular cooking you want to make sure and add your ingredients correctly to get the right texture okay we're ready for our next egg and also another important tip when baking is that you want to use room-temperature eggs not cold eggs you don't want them to clear up in the butter and sugar mixture so basically what you're looking for is for everything to be the same temperature okay and now for the highlight of these cookies ground aniseed and we're gonna use about 1 teaspoon of aniseed it's very flavorful and aromatic and it kind of has a licorice II set to it sometimes even like a peppermint flavor so good and these cookies it's been said that anise aids in digestion and that's probably why we see it in deserves and even the course like yo-yo anisette or even passkeys also because it tastes so good hmm smell the anise in there it's giving the dough of wonderful oil now we're ready for our driver and I'm scheduled a little bit at a time so the dry ingredients slowly incorporate into the butter and sugar mixture you can make the still ahead of time and keep it in the freezer or you can take up all the cookies and keep them in an airtight container for up to a month look at ice thickening up and as you can tell there's not a lot of liquid in this cookie so that's how it's going to tell you right away it's going to be kind of a crunchy drier cookies that's why it's so good just in key or pocket and that's basically the way that we used to eat it as kids we're ready to dump the rest in the batter gets really thick towards the end and it's enough of a workout using an electric mixer much less doing it by hand all right it's coming together as one big ball and now I know it's ready we're gonna turn it all that looks great one more addition the chocolate chips about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips you could add other ingredients to these cookies like nuts or candied fruit I like to add chocolate to mine I'm just gonna mix it in with our hands okay we're gonna move over here and we're gonna form this dough and you see how it's one big ball here it's not it doesn't fall apart it's not that flaky and you can form it with your hands and we're gonna kind of make a log out of it the Henrico and I've put it on a silicon baking sheet called a Silpat and basically nothing sticks to the sheet but if you wanted to you could just use parchment paper to we're gonna bake this in a preheated oven 350 degrees for about 30 minutes and then I'm gonna show you how I twice baked my cookies

my homemade cranberry nut granola so I'm just gonna toast some sunflower seeds and some pumpkin seeds about a third of a cup of pumpkin seeds and a quarter cup of sunflower seeds you can do whatever mix you like but I like it cuz it gives you kind of a burst of energy and it's gonna be perfect my granola so now I'm just gonna pop this in the oven just to toast up just a little bit and it kind of brings out all the flavor and then you add the toasted up seeds to the granola it's really good and in the meantime we all know that I love sugar so I got to sweeten up my granola concoction with a little bit of cranberry juice my maple syrup and brown sugar and I know it's kind of a little different cuz most people just add brown sugar and add sugar to it and bake it I just like it really chewy that really chewy texture when you bite into it's kind of like sticks to your teeth but it's really good so 1/2 a cup of unsweetened cranberry juice there we go dump that in there and the cranberry juice kind of reduces just a little bit and really gives it that nice bit of sweetness so cranberry juice maple syrup a little bit of really good maple syrup about a third of a cup Eriko and brown sugar we're gonna need about two-thirds of cup of brown sugar I know what else I need some cinnamon I like the cinnamon it kind of adds a nice bit of warmth so one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon let's turn on the stove yeah get a quick will stir just simmer it for a couple of minutes until the brown sugar dissolves so 2 cups of regular oats not the fast cook oats that you buy for oatmeal but the ones that take a little bit longer just because it's a bit more texture and flavor them quick oats will fall apart in the oven really quick so you don't want that a little bit of salt all right I smell my pumpkin seeds and my sunflower seeds and that's the thing when you're toasting seeds or nuts or whatever the minute you smell them there's super-delegates of a minute you smell them you want to pull them out because just a second too long and they can burn remember your nose it's a great tool in the kitchen so there you go they're nice and golden brown I just want to add them right in there I'm also gonna add some almonds now our sugar has dissolved you can see that slightly thick it makes it kind of sticky to which I live look at that mix that all together and I need to spray the baking sheets and vegetable spray because I don't want the sugar in the granola to stick after it's cooked so just a little bit little bit goes a long way and let's see here let's just pour it right on the baking sheet get it all in there and you want to do this while it's still warm because once it gets cold it's not as easy to work with so leave that and we'll grab there we go spatula or make it easier it doesn't stick to it just spread it out and then it'll bake it and get it nice and toasty cuz you want to cook the oats all right so we're gonna pop this in the oven again 325 for 30 minutes a moist and chewy trail snack that's loaded with flavor

my little aunt Carolina is home from college and I'm so excited because she's like a little sister to me so Jade and I are going to have her over for lunch today so we can all enjoy some Carolina's favorites turkey Noonan is it my spin on an Italian classic crispy turkey cutlets served on a bed of tomatoes and peppery arugula bacon and punch it the potatoes comfort food with a double dose of salty goodness and roasted apple pies with whipped cream cinnamon apples and whipped cream piled high on a flaky crust it's true family comfort food and I know Karolina is going to love it I'm gonna start by making a breading station for my turkey muna neza so one cup of seasoned flour 3 eggs lightly beaten and seasoned Italian breadcrumbs it's really easy now before we start coating the turkey I want to turn the stove on turning on about medium-high heat and you want to add about a third of a cup of olive oil because basically we're gonna pan sear the turkey and the great thing about this dish is you can eat it hot you can also eat it room temperature so anyhow I haven't seen Caroline in a while this is going to be a really fun lunch really easy going just the two of us sitting here in the kitchen and enjoying each other talking about you know her time at school because I haven't seen her in so long I thought this would be a nice way for us to kind of catch up so we've got some turkey here and I basically had the butcher take a turkey breast slice it thin about 1/2 to 1/4 inch that way when I bread it and put it in the pan it cooks instantly well not instantly but within a couple of minutes on each side which is pretty darn fast so now I just want to season both sides of the turkey cutlets salt and pepper and we're gonna flip them there we go let's give ourselves a little blip here to flip them and I happen to love trick you know you can make this with chicken if you want to with pork with with veal obviously really anything that you want so we'll salt a little pepper on both sides so here we go this is how we start grab the first one put it a little bit of flour and you want to just a nice even coating of the flour because the flour allows the egg to stick to it and then the egg allows the breadcrumb to stick to it and load three layers together create a really nice coating and into the bread crumbs number two into the flower and I'm telling you as long as you set yourself up like this like a little assembly line this is really really easy to do here we go okay so we're gonna cook those for a couple of minutes on each side in the meantime I'm gonna clean up and grab my platter all righty it smells so good in here we're ready to flip them so nice you can smell good there we go you want a nice deep golden crust on the outside okay they need a couple more minutes I'll get rid of this this is the kind of salad that I'm going to set up I've got a bunch of arugula that have already washed and just need a few these tomatoes what I like to do is just quarter the cherry tomatoes the fact that you put it on greens kind of cuts through the oil in the turkey cuz sometimes when you pan fry it it can be a little bit heavy but when you eat it with the arugula cause it's spicy and peppery all of those ingredients together make for a really heavenly bite perfect so now we got the tomatoes let's just take some of the arugula and just lay it on the platter just like this so it creates like a bed for the turkey milanesa to sit on and just kind of flatten it out a little bit you can pretty much do this with any lettuce you want I just love the arugula with this and a few tomatoes and see already how beautiful and colorful it is really good just like that or do a little bit of olive oil over the top this is basically the dressing extra virgin olive oil really good stuff and some salt just to season it and a little bit of pepper there we go let's grab our fork I just take it so just kind of put it right on there and just kind of layer them on top of each other and the heat from the meat will slowly soften the arugula leaves as well areare last one beautiful one last finishing touch blue pad me down Oh - Jan Oh we'll take a little carrot peeler here and do like long little strips of Parmesan cheese nice and buttery a little bit of salty bite on there it kind of melts on the hot meat an easy so that's perfect all right and that's it that's the holster criminal is they see how easy it was and I beautiful next I'm gonna make the ultimate comfort food my bacon and French eat the potatoes Karolina is gonna love this - decadent ingredients in one fabulous dish

I'm getting started on my spiced pumpkin raisin cookies and these are super chewy inside and they've got sort of a sugary crust on the outside so we're gonna start with the dry ingredients first so we're doing one cup of flour we're gonna add 2/3 of a cup of whole rolled oats and not the quick oats we really want the texture in here next we're gonna add half a teaspoon of baking soda and the baking soda will help the cookies kind of rise a little bit and half a teaspoon of salt fine salt next we are going to add a teaspoon whole teaspoon of ground cinnamon it's a great spice without being spicy and then 1/4 teaspoon of all spice it asks spicy like cinnamon but not a sweet so the to work really well together now we want to just whisk it now that that's all mixed together we're done with that and we're gonna switch bowls we're gonna continue with the wet ingredients so we're gonna start with some pumpkin puree and this comes in really handy during this time of year I use it for a lot of different things and these cookies don't have any butter and they don't have any eggs and they're vegan cookies I have a French child can't have any eggs so I thought I'd come up with some really delicious cookies that kids are gonna love but that you know my best friend's son can also eat at a party 1/2 a cup of pumpkin puree then it makes them nice and chewy on the inside next we're gonna add some sugar 3/4 of a cup of raw sugar see it's like a light golden brown it has a nice texture to it so it creates sort of a little bit of a crunch on the cookies we're also gonna sprinkle the cookies with a little bit of this raw sugar on top as well but it tastes just like regular sugar then a little more sweetness but this is a different type of sweetness we're gonna add a tablespoon of maple syrup and you can see that maple syrup is thick but not as thick as honey it's got a nice smokiness then 1/3 cup of vegetable oil we need a little bit more moisture since we're not adding any butter perfect vegetable oil but in there and then we're gonna do a little bit of vanilla extract so about a teaspoon of vanilla extract let's mix this first before we add the raisins in there and we're gonna add a half a cup of raisins and Jade is really into raisins these days as most kids are they're chewy and they're sweet it's in place of chocolate chips of course mix this all in we're gonna add the dry ingredients two batches at a time to allow the wet ingredients to slowly absorb the dry agrees that way you get a nice smooth cookie dough great and second batch awesome and that's it so now let's just move all of this stuff out of the way make some room and grab our baking sheet that I've lined with parchment paper just so the cookies don't stick and plus it makes it a lot easier for cleanup make sure you level off the cookies so they're all the same size drop them right there and then I kind of Pat them down just a little bit and then I top it with a little bit of the raw sugar when it bakes it kind of puffs up a little bit it's chewy on the inside and then it has that wonderful sort of sugary crust so what I'm gonna do is finish off my cookies then I'm gonna bake them at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes and up next I'm gonna finish off my chocolate orange pops and it started on my food parfaits a playful Halloween treat that the kids and grown-ups will love
the first thing I want to do for my federal salad is cook my fibro so I just want to bring four cups of water and one and a half cups of fat olive oil and fat all it kind of looks like spelt or even brown rice it's an ancient grain that we used to be used to make everything from pasta to bread cereals in fact my mom used to have fodder for breakfast instead of oatmeal so sort of has like a toasted nutty flavor so instead of like a pasta salad or a rice salad if they use federal so we're gonna bring that to a boil and it's gonna take about 30 minutes to cook I'm just gonna put the photo directly into the dish it's so nice it's tender it's just a slightly chewy and if you can't find fabro you could always use brown rice I think it's the perfect substitute for that it just reminds me of trattoria cooking it reminds me of rustic Italian cooking there we go okay I'll leave that to cool just a little bit in the meantime I'm gonna pair all my vegetables so basically we're making a fatter sound right so you want to have lots of color and I think red peppers are perfect for this so we'll add that on top of the federal and see it already it gives it lots of color and we'll add the green beans that I already blanched earlier lots of color lots of texture it makes it really helpful eat this way as well and of course I'm gonna add some olives that great like eggplant color a salad is all about color textures and flavors so it's really important that when you're creating any kind of salad you really think of those things and you can use your favorite ingredients these just happened to be my favorite ingredients okay now time for the red we got a season Asst so I'm gonna make a sherry vinaigrette I'm gonna use about a half a cup of sherry vinegar it's mild and not as strong as balsamic vinegar we're also going to add of course some sweet extra virgin olive oil and because this is a dressing you definitely want to add extra virgin olive oil I'm gonna add some Dijon mustard just a tablespoon it sort of thickens the dressing holds it together and also has sort of a sharp clean flavor I love from Dijon mustard so just give that a quick little whisk okay now just want to drizzle it right over just like any other grain or any other starch the fatter will absorb the vinaigrette some sweetness from the red pepper the fruitiness from the olives and of course that chewy texture from the fatter that I absolutely love the green beans are perfect there's still a little bit authentic just the way I like them
my wine spritzer is perfect with a light salad I combine Crispino vigil with cool sparkling water then I have some fun with my special ice cubes they have citrus zest froze right in in the spritzer they release their essence of orange and lemon this wine spritzer is a burst of color a summer night adding the citrus zest to my ice cubes will make my wine spritzer more elegant and super colorful it's one at a time and see how fun there you can see the zest right there now a whole bottle of Pinot Grigio now nobody Joe happens to be my mother's favorite wine we grew up with a lot of pinot greej around and i love it because it's crisp and it's light sometimes it can be slightly sweet as well just gonna add this entire bottle we're gonna use some sparkling water and see it creeps all these bubbles it's light it's refreshing it's really fun to look at and with these little ice cubes with his essence eyes is perfect because the pinot grigio has hints of lemon flavor in it and so the lemon with the citrus it works perfectly so I'm just gonna give it a quick little spin and see so much fun mmm those fresh herbs with the lentils in the rice it's a perfect mouthful of lots of different flavors so billions so good salty prosciutto sweet orange vinaigrette and the light and yummy tender spinach leaves mine you just take a sip from my wine spritzer to wash it all down so pretty
I'm having two and a half cups of cherry tomatoes for my chicken meat an easy with fennel tomato sauce so now that I have the cherry tomatoes cut and my fennel has softened nicely I only took five minutes to do now we want to add the tomatoes into the fennel and we just want to cook them for a few minutes just to soften them they're nice and sweet and we'll add a little bit of salt and pepper just to season the tomatoes a little bit this is gonna be so so pretty okay while the tomatoes soften I'm ready to cut up and pack up my food cotta this is my egg white frittata with my locks and the arugula now that it's cooled completely I'm just gonna cut it up look how pretty that is I'm just gonna cut it again into little squares you know what I just want to make sure it tastes right I don't think she's gonna miss that corner mmm mmm the LOX and that nice salty bite but it's also buttery that is a good one so now let's grab the Tupperware and I'm gonna grab my label basically what I did is I labeled all the dishes and just had reheating instructions so we have the egg white frittata with lox and arugula enjoy at room temperature perfect we're trying to make this as easy on Vanessa as possible so now just gonna grab all the frittata I'm just lay it in the Tupperware this way the Tupperware will keep it nice and fresh because it's sealed do that and put the lid on and the egg white frittata is done I'll just set it over there and we'll pack it up in a little bit okay now that they're starting to soften you just want to soften a little bit and we're gonna add a little bit of dried thyme mmm the lemony time is really earthy and its really good in here perfect we also need a little bit of garlic just gonna add one clove of garlic in there just for a little extra flavor again not too much garlic a little bit of garlic for flavor is good just chop that up and we'll just cook it a little bit in here there we go perfect let that just sort of infuse the flavors of the sauce okay so now one last ingredient a little mascarpone cheese we're gonna add half a cup and look how beautiful that is nice and creamy perfect I just kind of add that all in there it just melts into the tomatoes and the fennel and I think it might be time for my lunch I'm gonna grab a plate and grab the small little chicken milanesa that I made for myself let's grab a sauce and basically all you want to do with this is just melt the must component cheese and then turn off the heat and let it cool that is all you do mix it all together see how nice that looks and then I do a little bit of sauce right over it just like that let's taste it I'm excited I'll just smell the food makes me hungry hmm mmm crunchy nice crunchy crust lots of flavor from that Parmesan cheese and the herbs mmm all right up next I'm gonna make a very simple dessert that involves a little bit of chocolate but I think the nesic is gonna love
I'm chopping half a cup of walnuts and just roughly chop them I like a little bit of crunch on my crow stop and I really like how the walnuts work well with the apples and with the gorgonzola cheese that we're gonna add in a minute the walnuts are chopped apples are cooled so it's time to add all the walnuts right in there then we need lemon and you only need about a teaspoon of lemon zest it's we need a little bit of lemon juice as well there we go that's about right now for the best part the gorgonzola cheese it's an aged bleu cheese and it's made usually in the Piedmont or the Lombardi regions of Italy that's where they make the best kind of bleu cheese and it's aged for about three to four months and the consistency changes depending on how long it's been aged it's really good stuff and with the apples and the nuts it makes for wonderful flavor and sometimes it can be crumbly sometimes it can be super soft this one's kind of in the middle and it's got a nice pungent flavor that's why I like it so much and we're gonna give this a quick toss just to blend all of the ingredients together mmm it kind of melts into the crostata into the apples and everything and it just ends up being so yummy so now time for the dough so I just want to flour the board a little bit just so the dough doesn't stick to the wooden board oh this is nice really important to let the dough have time to rest and sit so the butter can get nice and cold and a little bit more flour on top of the dough grab the rolling pin and I also want to flour the rolling pin so the rule engine doesn't stick and we'll just start rolling out the dough and see as you rule it it kind of spreads the butter throughout you can actually see pieces of butter in there and that's what you want so that way when it bakes it becomes nice and flaky and you want to roll it into approximately an 11 inch round and then about a quarter inch in thickness makes you work out your arms it's perfect okay that looks about right I want to roll it on the rolling pin roll it onto the baking sheet but come back over here then I take my filling that's cooled completely and we put it in the middle of the dough so that we can fold the dough over the filling great just kind of move up the edges and I spread it out a little bit just leaving a two inch border everywhere and I take the edges I just fold them over see just like this see if it creates its own little shell so that it keeps all the filling intact and inside and it doesn't really matter how you plead it just make sure there aren't any cracks if there are just press with your fingers and it kind of seals the cracks and look how beautiful that looks and just brush the sides with the egg wash just like that it feels the dough and it allows it to get nice and golden brown there we go okay so now bake it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes until the edges are nice and golden and the insides kind of bubbly and the cheese melts into the apples and then I'm gonna clean up and get my fat filled cooking losing with three different cheeses this dish is decadent and delicious
steakhouse food is so rich and satisfying that I've decided to make some my Steakhouse favorites at home with the unique Italian twist I'm gonna bake a luscious focaccia studded with bits of garlic fresh rosemary and grapes for a side dish I'm gonna bake tiny orzo pasta with sauteed mushrooms nutty fontina cheese and peas for the main course a meaty rib eye steak seasoned with herbs and topped with a tangy black olive vinaigrette and for the finale a lemon-lime frozen custard topped with crumbled a Medici cookies these are my versions of steakhouse classics a dinner that's a cut above the rest you've got to have great bread to go along with a great steak here's one that I love because it's hard enough to hold its own and it couldn't be easier to make focaccia with rosemary and grapes comes out of the oven warm smelling and tasting divine one of my favorite things about steak houses are all the breads that come to the table right at the beginning of the meal and I'm gonna make one of my favorites today I'm using shallots and garlic and I'm only using one shallot so not too much nice oniony flavor but really mild and instead of chopping it up I like to just slice it and it doesn't take as long as onion to cook so in that 20 to 25 minutes it kind of just caramelize --is and all the flavors seep straight into the focaccia bread we've got the shallot then I like to add one garlic clove that's all you need just a little bit of that garlicky flavor what's a steakhouse without some garlic right so no it's funny when I go to a steakhouse for dinner I'm Todd I'll always get the big steak and I'll have a few bites of his steak but it's all the sides that I love so the breads and the pastas you know and of course the desserts okay so now that I've got that polute flour on the board there we go and the pizza dough and I like to make my focaccia into a rectangle just add a little bit of flour to my rolling pin just do it that way so again just like pizza we're gonna roll it onto the little rolling pin and then put it on the parchment on a baking sheet okay so now I get to top it all the things that I love lots of extra virgin olive oil I just take a little brush and just kind of brush the olive oil all over we've added that I want to add some coarse sea salt just get it all over okay and now we'll do the shallots and the garlic just mix it up you know so every bite gets a little bit of everything on it it also needs some herbs of course so I'm just gonna add a little bit of rosemary over the top great color and great flavor it's really fragrant too now this is the really fun part and I know it's gonna sound really weird but I'm gonna add grapes green and red grapes on top somehow the sweet juices pettite rate be a focaccia dough and that's it just want to press them down when you do it okay so I'm going to bake this at 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes until it's all golden-brown and super yummy today I'm raising my favorite steakhouse foods to a whole new level for a side dish I want something luscious that will complement my steak baked orzo with fontina and peas is absolutely decadent and delicious oh my gosh the shallots and the rosemary and the garlic heavenly while that cools down I'm gonna get started on one of my favorite sides I'm gonna make this creamy orzo so we're gonna start with some butter and chopped up onion and mushrooms I'm also gonna add a little bit of salt just a slowly stir to wilt and soften the onions so now I'm gonna grab mushroom and I just quarter them so you need to do and I'm just using some nice brown mushrooms but you can use any kind of assorted mushrooms that you like okay so we're also gonna add the mushrooms skin with the butter and a little bit more salt Rumer you want to flavor every single layer so you're not stuck adding tons of salt to your dish run at the end after everything's already cooked and then it doesn't absorb the flavor anyway just want to mix that all together okay so that's going to take about seven to eight minutes for the mushrooms and the onions to cook down so while that cooks I've got four cups of low-sodium chicken broth and to that I'm gonna add orzo it's one of my favorite little pastas and see they look like little grains of rice so one pound of orzo into four cups of low-sodium chicken broth that's boiling I only have to cook it for seven minutes until it's slightly cooked and we finished cooking in the oven later on and up next I'm going to show you how to put this fantastic creamier together
should go for tomorrow never stopping for tomorrow I didn't act you were doing the corn tortellini and it is gonna be can corner hosting a working lunch is a perfect chance to make a great impression I've got a lunch menu that's original and easy my roll chicken sandwich is just right it's got lots of juicy chicken and a fresh tasting herb aioli wrapped in an elegant package garbanzo bean and zucchini salad is a colorful blend of beans and fresh vegetables with a light lemon vinaigrette topped with cheese my lemon basil potatoes are full of flavor from the broth are cooked in and to relax afterward a guilt-free shake of hot chocolate and espresso blended with low-fat vanilla yogurt and skim milk this working lunch is hardly any work at all you you I don't want to make anything too complicated for a working lunch so I'm going to create an easy ruled sandwich it starts with a light aioli made from low-fat mayonnaise and yogurt with spicy fresh arugula parsley and garlic I'll mix the aioli with store-bought roasted chicken and spread it on warm tortillas my rolled chicken sandwich with arugula and parsley is fancy enough for working lunch but easy enough to make any time I'm gonna start with some store-bought mayonnaise now they only traditionally it's a garlic flavored sauce and I really like to make it at home but instead of going ahead and making it from scratch I'm actually going to start out with mayonnaise because the texture of aioli is very similar to mayonnaise and the flavors as well and then we're gonna add garlic now it's a garlic flavored sauce you got to have some garlic but I'm only going to use one garlic clove next I'm going to add some yogurt some low-fat plain yogurt and the yogurt kind of adds a little bit of a tart flavor and a little bit of moisture as well to create a nice smooth aioli so 1/2 a cup of plain low-fat yogurt next a little bit of lemon zest just a little bit for a little acidity we're gonna use one teaspoon of white wine vinegar and white vinegar is pretty clean so you don't eat much and it's not too strong either and not to scare anybody but we're gonna use one anchovy and I know that a lot of people are like anchovy oh my gosh but it is so good just creates that salty bite then a handful of peppery arugula and you roogle a-- just gives it a nice green color to it and it has a nice sharp bite too and for a little bit of freshness some parsley flat-leaf Italian parsley and for the parsley I just want to give it a quick little chop so I like to add a little freshness in color to my aioli and of course we're also going to add some chives now the thing about the chives is it gives it a little bit of an onion flavor but it's very very mellow and I think it works really well in the aioli there we go and now just a little sprinkle of salt because remember the anchovies are salty so we don't want to add too much salt and some freshly ground black pepper just seasoning my aioli and it's very easy to do this and it's really great so it is done and take a look at this see how nice that looks the nice green specs and I'm gonna grab my chicken so I've got two chicken breasts and it's just store-bought rotisserie chicken it's very flavorful and it's also juicy when I have people over for lunch I gotta remember sort of well what do people like to eat and make sure that when you have a number of people that you have something for them that most people like and most people will love chicken and they like chicken salads for lunch cuz it's kind of healthy and it's light but it's still filling and satisfying so you want to keep that in mind when you're cooking for people especially when it's a working lunch so well dump the chicken and on top of the chicken here goes B aioli nice and creamy and it creates a nice luscious sauce on the chicken and it lots of moisture too all right so now dragons done I'm gonna turn on my skillet I'm gonna show you a little bit of a different way to make these sandwiches I'm actually using whole-wheat tortillas and what I like to do is to turn on a skillet and kind of heat up the tortilla by heating it up I'm just sort of bringing out the flavors toasting flavors a little bit and it softens tortilla so that you can roll it up nicely so I just warm them up in a skillet about 30 seconds on each side and you'll see that immediately they start to soften which is really great okay so this one's done now will I do that one I'm gonna heat up my second one I take a spoonful of chicken and you put it right in the middle and then you just spread it with the back of the spoon you want to leave a little border because we're gonna roll it up and for some more freshness in color I'm adding a little bit more Rugal ax right on top and then I take the bottom corner and I roll it up like a jelly roll that's why you don't want to put too much on the sides otherwise a little kind of moves out okay and take a knife and I just cut it on a diagonal and look how pretty that is so I couldn't onto my serving platter and I put the other one over it just like that make it look really pretty we can turn the stove off and grab this one roll it up how pretty is that it's perfect right all right so now and this is how easy it is to eat too mmm that I Olli I'm so good its garlicky but it's not overpowering and all that freshness from the urge is perfect creamy but light - up next I'd the perfect salad to go with my chicken rolls my garbanzo bean and zucchini salad
we're ready to make a filling the on flavored whipped cream you know what whipped cream is so easy to make at home that there's no need to go out there and buy the pre-made stuff oh this is good 3/4 of a cup of heavy whipping cream chilled nice and cold and we're going to start beating it the Kolbe the clean the easier it is to fluff it up on fat all right we're ready to sweeten it going to use a quarter cup of powdered sugar you don't want to overbeat this otherwise it'll turn into butter when you want it to be light and fluffy when you put it into your tart shell all right now we're ready for the flavoring almond flavored liqueur it's amaretto it's infused with those little I'm addicted cookies so we're gonna do two tablespoons of amaretto liqueur and we're gonna whip that for another minute I wish you could smell this so good already it's done now for a little bit of crunch I'm gonna add some toasted chopped almonds right here all right you want to be careful and fold in the almonds so you don't deflate the whipped cream the almonds add a little crunch okay let's put some plastic wrap pop it in the fridge until my pastry shells cool nice and cool broccoli is a very versatile vegetable and it's a favorite in Italy this is one of the easiest ways to make it it takes less than 10 minutes to cook the florets to bright green crispy perfection then I add my favorite condiment a splash of tangy Meyer lemon olive oil broccoli lemon oil gives your tasteless a little work out of their own what I've been doing is making some broccoli florets and it's super easy you just get a head of broccoli just like this and we'll just cut some of this off just like that and I like to trim them just the top part but you could eat the actual stock if you wanted to and I like to cut them approximately bite-sized all right let's check the water I want to salt the water ahead of time to flavor the broccoli it's a nice handful of salt and put them in the boiling water just a few out of time let them sit in the water for a few minutes and these are gonna take about four or five minutes to cook through in the meantime I'm gonna check on my tart wow that looks good its heart is golden brown on top and it smells heavenly it's puffed up but not too much and the sides of risen I'll hold in the whipped cream perfectly I'm gonna let it sit for a little bit and cool off before I end up filling it meantime let's get these broccoli out oh they look good and you want to get them out of the water before they start turning brown so just a couple of minutes and see how piping hot there this is what I like to drizzle over my broccoli just add some Meyer lemon olive oil and the Meyer lemon is sweeter than regular lemon so it gives a sort of little sweetness a little citrus punch to clean and cleanse your palate after natan that chicken Tetrazzini will just toss it just like that and if you can't find Meyer lemon olive oil you could just use some extra-virgin olive oil and then just squeeze a little bit of fresh lemon juice inside perfect that's it my broccoli all ready and up next I'm gonna fill my TARDIS
okay so now it's time for me to make my little tasty sandwiches for the hike I'm going to turn on my grill pan get it nice and hot and the first thing I want to do is make my marinade so I'm gonna start with my herbs tarragon a little bit of fresh thyme and some basil mostly basil a big chunk of basil a little bit of thyme and a little bit of tarragon there we go I like the tarragon cuz it's nice and light with the veggies and the time is a little earthier and then of course the basil well you just can't do grilled vegetables without basil nice and fresh kind of minty and I like the fresh herbs just because you know what they have a lot more flavor than dried herbs do it just makes a little fancier and tastes better all right herbs it smells so good oh really good that in there and some extra virgin olive oil or make a really quick marinade to give the veggies a little bit more flavor there we go and some garlic and these sandwiches are really easy to make and they're very portable and they're really yummy so a little bit of garlic just to flavor the veggies I find that this kind of marinade will make any kind of vegetable taste really good and living in California we got a lot of fresh vegetables all year round and of course fresh herbs so take advantage of it there we go chop up the garlic not too much just a little garlic get that in there we'll do some salt and some very finely ground black pepper and for a little extra sweetness there we go need a little muscle there some sun-dried tomatoes there you go they're intensely sweet so chewy they're really good they need a little sweetness in the sandwich just chop that up you know sometimes I eat these but just like the handful just as a snack I put them in salads equipment everything and look at that color with the green from the fresh herbs yummy alright let's just mix that all up now time for the veggies we're gonna start with Japanese eggplant and I like them because the skin is super thin so I don't have to salt it I don't have to wait or have to do anything I just slice it and put it on the grill also it fits in the sandwich perfectly there we go and zucchini Todd and I both love zucchini and they're just as Hardy as eggplant so it works really well on the sandwich get a little variety here and again cut it about 1/4 inch thick and get the veggies into the marinade you just want to give them a quick toss that's it good girl all right my grill pan should be hot so let's get veggies on the grill all right so those cook for a couple of minutes in the meantime I've got my baguette and what I want to do with the leftover marinade is just put it on the bread you want to make use of this marinade because it's really good stuff okay so put it there and then we'll season the top piece too and I like this cuz the perfect size will cut it in half and then Todd can have one half I can have the other it's the perfect amount of food when you're going hiking so let's just grab all of that all right get rid of that flip these guys over there we go nice grill marks soft yummy all right now time for little cheese got a little goat cheese and I took the goat cheese out earlier so they can be nice and soft so I could spread it on the baguette oops I really like goat cheese Todd really likes goat cheese so it works really well and we'll put a little bit on the top as well see how easy it is just spread if you leave it at room temp look at all those great colors close that up and grab my bag of spinach I'm using little baby spinach just again it makes it a little bit more special than just using regular lettuce and spinach holds up better so as I'm going on my hike it won't wilt the way that regular lettuce will wilt in a salad actually I'm gonna wait hold off on that for one second I'm gonna start taking my veggies off see how golden and beautiful those are nice grill marks and lady eggplant slices right on top of the goat cheese and the hot eggplant to was like soften the goat cheese even more flavor it and then a layer of zucchini there we go I think we can get one more then the extra veggies I just kicked them in the fridge I snack on them perfect look how pretty that looks a little bit of spinach right on top see oh nice that looks and then put the top on there we go and push downs everything sticks together and I'll have to do is cut it here we go look at that does that not look great they're gonna be great alright so all I have left to do now is wrap these sandwiches up get all my hiking gear together and one cut get you we're going hiking all right so those cook for a couple of minutes in the meantime I've got my baguette and what I want to do with the leftover marinade is just put it on the bread want to make use of this marinade because it's really good stuff okay so put it there and then we'll season the top piece too and I like this because the perfect-sized will cut it in half and then Todd can have one half I can have the other it's the perfect amount of food when you're going hiking so let's just grab all of that alright get rid of that flip these guys over there we go nice grill marks soft yummy all right now time for little cheese got a little goat cheese and I took the goat cheese out earlier okay so now it's time for me to make my little tasty sandwiches for the hike I'm going to turn on my grill pan get it nice and hot and the first thing I want to do is make my marinade so I'm gonna start with my herbs tarragon a little bit of fresh thyme and some basil mostly basil a big chunk of basil a little bit of thyme and a little bit of tarragon there we go I like the tarragon cuz it's nice and light with the veggies and the time is a little earthier and then of course the basil well you just can't do grow vegetables without basil nice and fresh kind of minty and I like the fresh herbs just because you know what they have a lot more flavor than dried herbs do it just makes a little fancier and tastes better all right pepper and for a little extra sweetness there we go need a little muscle there some sun-dried tomatoes there you go they're intensely sweet chewy and they're really good they need a little sweetness in the sandwich just chop that up you know sometimes I eat these buy it just like the handful just as a snack I put them in salads a primitive thing and look at that color with the green and the fresh herbs yummy alright let's just mix that all up now time for the veggies we're gonna start with Japanese eggplant and I like them because the skin is super thin so I don't have to salt it I don't have to wait or have to do anything I just slice it and put it on the grill also it fits in the sandwich perfectly there we go and zucchini tap and I both love zucchini and they're just as Hardy's eggplant so it works really well on the sandwich get a little variety here and again cut it about a quarter inch thick and get the veggies into the marinade you just want to give them a quick toss that's it good girl alright my grill pan should be hot so let's get the veggies on the grill Erbs it smells so good oh really good that in there and some extra-virgin olive oil or make a really quick marinade to give the veggies a little bit more flavor better we go and some garlic and these sandwiches are really easy to make and they're very portable and they're really yummy so a little bit of garlic just to flavor the veggies I find that this kind of marinade will make any kind of vegetable taste really good and living in California we got a lot of fresh vegetables all year round and of course fresh herbs so take advantage of it there we go chop up the garlic not too much just a little garlic get that in there we'll do some salt and some very finely ground black
if you want to make an inexpensive haunted house for your Halloween party it's easy I got some ideas from Bethany Barton can a Hollywood set designer and children's book author I think a lot of the fun of Halloween is more pretending you're scared than actually being scared Bethany shows us how to turn ordinary cardboard boxes into a spooky funhouse that your kids will love I think that I just have a kid great so I just tap into my inner child brain a little glow-in-the-dark paint orange is fun we need more orange a few spooky creatures I really like monsters and creepy things and skeletons and you have a whimsical house of horrors I want to do I think a big spider web your little ghosts and goblins will have a blast I'm just trimming my chocolate orange cake my spiced pumpkin and raisin cookies are out of the oven and they're cooling so I trimmed the ends off because I want to have really nice squares I let sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes until it firmed up and see I've done all of these already and I stick lollipop stick in it then I dip it in a little bit of melted chocolate and safflower oil the safflower oil allows the chocolate to set once it's in the fridge and keep it nice and shiny I take some of the little ghosts a nice color combo and then I come over here and I do a few orange sprinkles as well okay next one you this is really fun for the kids to do in Halloween so our chocolate orange pops are done now I'm gonna pop these in the fridge and let them sit for about an hour so the chocolate can set so it's time to make the grape of mango parfaits and these are super cute we're gonna start with a bunch of these black grapes now you could use any grapes you want but the black grapes then with the orange mango very Halloweeny they're nice and sweet and what I'm gonna do is cut them in half just because it makes it a lot easier to eat especially for the kids and I started this type of thing with Jade I find it's a much easier way to get her to eat the yogurt I'll give her a little parfait a little bit of granola I'll do some grapes and strawberries and just kind of do a layering of different fruits with the yogurt all right I'm gonna grab some mango and I'm using frozen mango that I just thought what I want to do is just cut it up a little bit let's grab one of our cups and this is the plastic cups with kids are holding and they drop it well no biggie right I've got some Greek yogurt that's flavored with honey we start with some grapes and we're gonna put a bunch of the grapes right on the bottom now we're gonna add the Greek yogurt and I like the Greek yogurt cuz it's nice thick and the honey sweetens it a little bit put a couple spoonfuls right in there then some mango and I want to make sure you can see the layers you can see the black and the orange and then the white because that is the fun of it and then more Greek yogurt nice then I'm gonna add some pumpkin seeds you know it's Halloween so I thought it'd be fun to toast some pumpkin seeds to finish it all off because I like a little more crunch and a little bit goodness some I'm addicted cookies they're almond cookies and they add a little crunch traditionally in Italy we eat these how many through cookies with tea I like it when the parfaits have sort of a little height on them I think they look a lot prettier that is my grape and mango parfait so I'm gonna finish off making the rest of my parfaits Jade and I are gonna change into our Halloween costumes and then the Halloween festivities begin
now the mushrooms and the onions are nice and golden I'm gonna add some more Sala wine one cup of Marsala wine now the thing about Marsala wine is it's a Sicilian fortified wine so it's a little bit richer than regular wine and it's slightly sweeter too and what I love about it is that it gives so much richness to the mushrooms so what I want to do is just scrape the bottom of the pan get all of those little brown caramelized bits that's gonna add so much flavor to my creamy orzo I am ready to assemble my creamy orzo dish so I've got my orzo it's already cooked but I need my oven mitts because the pan is hot instead of draining the orzo out of the chicken stock just gonna pour all the liquid and the orzo into my bowl you need to give it a little liquid so it can continue to cook meat cheese cheese cheese cheese that's what makes the orzo so yummy and you just want to grate it because it's gonna melt really well just one cup of fontina cheese we're gonna add that to the creamy orzo mmm okay we're also gonna add a little bit of mozzarella cheese you want about a cup of mozzarella I just want to cut it into little cubes what's that enough in there and about a half a cup of cream all right you want that creaminess and that's what the cream is gonna give you and it keeps the orzo nice and moist when it continues to cook in the oven and my favorite thing in the world peas I love the color they're slightly sweet we're gonna add 1/2 cup of peas and I've always got in my freezer so it just makes it really easy salt little pepper right on top now making this a quick Little Mix number gonna add the mushrooms section indulgence so now let's turn off the mushrooms and the onions mmm let's pick up that pan and add the mushrooms and the onions a nice amount of meatiness time to pour this entire mixture into my buttered casserole dish to finish it all off I've got some store-bought breadcrumbs and to them I'm gonna add just a teaspoon of thyme dried thyme into that we're gonna add a little bit of Parmesan cheese you need a little more cheese on top otherwise you don't get a nice cheesy crust about a quarter cup of really yummy buttery salty Parmesan cheese and I'll just kind of sprinkle it all over the top just like that okay so now put it in the oven 375 degrees for 30 minutes until the tops nice and golden brown for my steakhouse dinner I have to have the perfect steak I start with a thick ribeye steak i season it with a crust of herbs salt and pepper and Grill it until it's just right then I serve it with a thick vinaigrette made from fruity black olives and spicy Dijon mustard my black olive vinaigrette makes this steak a four-star classic look at my creamy orzo it's got a beautiful crust on top nice and golden alright while that cools I can get started on my main dish the steak so I've got a two to two and a half inch ribeye steak so salt and pepper on both sides and we go pepper both sides and what I love about the ribeye is the marbleization look at that so salt and pepper really nice flavorful crust on the outside of the meat I'm also gonna add earth vermont's now this is what makes this extra extra special okay gives it kind of like a an herb acrost and the herb prevalence is just a mixture of dried rosemary thyme basil marjoram and lavender and it just sometimes fennel this one's got fennel in it too and it just gives it that extra oomph that makes the steak really yummy nice aroma to when the herbs touch the grill we're also gonna have just a little bit of oil there's already plenty of marbleization on the meat but you want a little bit of oil to help keep it moist and give it a nice brown color on the grill so now want to make sure the grill pan is nice and hot which it is we're gonna cook it for six to eight minutes on each side until it's medium-rare and up next I'm gonna make my black olive vinaigrette
I've been adding the flavors grease to my Italian cooking today and I'm gonna finish with my version of a Greek delicacy it's got light phyllo dough pillows filled with smoked Italian mozzarella they're fried until the phyllo is crisp and the cheese is melted top them off with sweetened figs and crunchy black sesame seeds so we're gonna start with the topic I've got 3/4 of a cup of honey in this bowl and I'm going to add some dried figs and we want to rehydrate them by heating them up in a little bit of honey just like that there we go and I've already taken the baklava out of the oven that's gonna cool while I make this appetizer I've also got some vegetable oil that I'm heating up it's got to heat up to 350 degrees so that I can fry up the smoked mozzarella so now I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do what makes the smoked mozzarella crispy is the phyllo so we're gonna take a sheet of phyllo just put it on our board and take my smoke one side left and we're gonna cut it on about one inch pieces or so so you just want to fold it over fold the phyllo over the smoked mozzarella just like that and then wrap it just like you would a burrito just like that so let's do another one put it down take another piece of one sided left fold it over fold over the sides just wrap it and wrap it all the way down see it's really really good who doesn't like fried cheese so we're just gonna put it in there for about two minutes on each side there we go they're popping up a little bit all right the first one is ready it's nice and golden okay last one out now I'm gonna show you what I do you put it on a plate just grab the last one I want to take a little bit of my honey and figs pour it right over the top we're also going to add black sesame seeds or you can even use regular sesame seeds and just toast them isn't that gorgeous it's so beautiful I absolutely love it okay so now I get to dig in you did that mix of the smoky mozzarella with the sweet height and the chewiness from the figs and see how stripped the baklava they're like little packages are they cute or what all the nuts apricots and honey it's funny although every country has their own cuisine we actually are a lot more similar to our neighbors than we are different and sometimes a little touch of your own into any recipe it just makes it extra extra special like these little baccala
and I've got lots of boiling water and very important to flavor the water with salt and I'm using kosher salt and i'm going to use whole wheat pasta instead of semolina pasta today it's very healthy but it's also very good and I'm only going to use half of this box so about eight ounces while that's cooking i'm going to start the sauce we're going to cook the sauce so we don't need to use extra virgin you can just use regular olive oil for a little bit of that fruity flavor but not overpowering nice sharp knife we're gonna use some onions nice egg hot click them up and we're gonna add some salt right on top and don't be afraid of a little steam a little piece it's all good when you're in the kitchen add a little bit of fresh ground black pepper right on top again flavoring every single layer of your dish alright while these cook I'm going to start in the Swiss chard now for anybody that doesn't know what Swiss chard is it's part of the mustard green family so you could substitute kale for this or you can substitute mustard greens even spinach and you know what with this you can make food tacos which is why my mom used to do add as a side dish they're very versatile and very yummy let's tip all of this and put it in here a little more olive oil a little more salt and a little more pepper so while that cooks down gotta add some garlic and you can add as much or as little garlic as you like we've got some red pepper flakes the reason I like adding the red pepper flakes is because it adds some heat some kick so in the back of your throat it's kind of peppery it's really good add chopped tomatoes and we're using chopped tomatoes because they're sweeter there's more moisture so they'll add a really nice flavor to the sauce now white wine just a quarter cup and if it's good enough to drink it's good enough to cook with so this is going to cook for about five minutes and my pasta is cooking so we want to put the lid on just so it locks in the moisture and the flavor what I like about the kalamata olives is there fruity and the rich they're even smooth in your mouth so I'm just giving them a rough chop hmm perfect toss a little bite inside ready to assemble the pasta dish you believe how light and healthy this is it smells and looks so good
my friend tally and I are ready to test-drive another sushi roll this time it's a sweet blend of crap avocado and mango thank you that's good right so that's good all right you know what I think I could do with this one though black sesame seeds but I think it'll be really pretty against the white rice more just yet I love the mango mango too sweet is good yeah it's really really tasty I'm gonna cut my mango in just small thin slices that we're gonna use in the roll so I'm also gonna use some avocado and you don't need very much in this in fact less is more you don't want to overfill the roll too much or otherwise when you go to roll it everything kind of squirts off the sides so a little bit goes a long way just cut it again in small little thin slices everything is petite and thin and then move it there we go and then take my red bell pepper from before and again I just sliced the red bell pepper super thin all right so we got our veggies down now let's grab some crack so I got some really nice lump crap so a pound of lump crap and I've already kind of gone through to make sure there weren't any extra shells and broke it up a little bit so a little bit of mayonnaise it's funny how much mayonnaise you actually end up using so about a quarter cup of mayo no that's about right and some lemon juice from before about four teaspoons or so of lemon juice you can usually get that from a juicy half eleven and just sweeten it up a little bit some brown sugar we're gonna use four teaspoons of brown sugar and if you're thinking it's kind of weird that I'm adding brown sugar it actually works because the crab is slightly sweet so the brown sugar just enhances the flavor four teaspoons here oh that's four that's done mix it all together and I'm set back so now I grab my sushi nap now this is a sushi mat you can get at Asian markets and I just wrap it in plastic wrap so nothing sticks to it it's reusable it's inexpensive it's something you can keep at home and you can use whenever you feel like having sushi night grab some sushi rice so the sushi rice you can make yourself but I grabbed some from Thomas aku it's easy enough to make but it takes a while and you gotta get the right proportions of vinegar so it's just easier to buy it we're gonna use some of this later and now here's the trick to dealing with sticky rice now it's called sticky rice for a reason it sticks to everything so I like to dip my hands in some water and then I take my hands and spread out the rice and you want a nice thin layer and you want to keep a border about one to two inches so when you roll it up you just peel the mat off easily nice thin layer now I need the nori so nori is just seaweed so it's a sheet of seaweed again something you get at an Asian market but these days you can find it at your local grocery store so that goes right on top and now some crab so take about a spoonful of crab and you know what when you're making sushi kind of have to use your hands so that's good and then spread it out so lower half now we're gonna do about four slices of mango right on top and I love it the sweet mango then the buttery avocado let's start with two slices of avocado just like that and I'll put another two and you just want to put the avocado kind of bumping up against the mango and then I take a few slices of the red bell pepper for color and a little texture and put it right on top now comes the fun part so I take the mat and just hold the crab mixture Thanks flip it and low and flip and roll and don't look back just keep going okay and see how easily it comes off because there's plastic wrap on it and what up I just take that and you take the mat and just kind of squeeze it to form a nice roll and then then I take my black sesame seeds cuz I love the color look at that color combo right it's gorgeous and then sometimes what I do is I take it and gently just kind of rule it there and pick up all of the leftover black sesame seeds all over the table good way to clean it up now to cut it we're gonna dip our knife in some water because again the rice will stick to not only to stick your hands and sticks to everything sticks to the knife too so we cut the first one off and you want to dip your knife after each cut and then you want to cut them kind of thin depends on how you like to put it in your mouth I don't want it too thick see look at that how pretty is that you can see all the colors alright so I'm going to finish cutting and finish making my rolls up next if you thought all of the sushi look the same it doesn't see what I need it's my fun salmon hand roll a whimsical cone of sushi that's blast to build
so it's time to make my pizza Bianca with kale and meatballs I just got some store-bought pizza dough and I'm spreading it out on a baking sheet I put a little bit of olive oil down on the baking sheet first you want to make sure that the dough isn't very cold because it'll be easier to spread out we're gonna move it and we're gonna get started on our fish amel we're gonna start with two tablespoons of butter unsalted two tablespoons of flour we're making a roux and then we're gonna add milk to it to make the cream sauce that we're going to put on the pizza melt the butter and the flour together until the butter has absorbed all of the flour and it's called pizza Bianca because there's no red sauce on this pizza stir this for like a minute or so just to cook out that raw flour flavor we're gonna add one cup of room temperature milk you want to make sure all of the ingredients are room temperature so nothing ceases one bay leaf just for flavor it just kind of adds a deep warmth some salt some pepper and a little bit of nutmeg about an eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg to give the cream sauce some flavor and some depth and last but not least we're gonna add one garlic clove just to infuse a little bit of garlic flavor into this fish about just kind of kind of leave it whole whisk it for like two three minutes until it thickens alright so the bishop mal is done and I'll show you with the spoon what it's supposed to look like turn it off and what I do is I usually dip in the back of the spoon and then I go like that and if it stays separate then you know it's ready now time to take out the bay leaf we're done with that and we're also going to take out the garlic clove we take my pizza dough I'm going to juice a little bit of olive oil on the top and then we're going to core the bechamel take a spatula and just spread the bechamel and leave about a one-inch border now we need the mozzarella so we've got some shredded mozzarella mozzarella melts beautifully we're gonna add 3/4 of a cup move it on so I've got my 8 8 balls left over from before they cut them all in half it's gonna make it a lot easier to put them on the pizza we're gonna top it with more cheese 1/2 a cup of grated Parmesan cheese right over the top what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this in a 450 degree oven about 15 minutes so it's time to add the kale on top of the pizza we're taking two medium-sized kale leaves I'm taking out the rib you feel like you're eating some greens in the whole thing so you feel better about getting it what I want to do is just kind of chop the leaves you want to kind of cut them a little small so that the pizza doesn't have to be in there for too long take the kale and just spread it on top of the meatballs so now I take a little bit of olive oil and I just drizzle it right over the top because you want to keep the kale nice and moist and the final touch a sprinkle of salt so we're gonna put this in the oven for another 10 minutes at 450 degrees that's so now what I want to do loosen the bottom for the spatula I take my pizza cutter and we're just gonna cut the pizza in half I want to taste one of the meatballs and I want to taste some of that kale whoo-hah so creamy with the nice crispy kale chips all right up next one of Todd's favorite ways to eat meatballs my meatball paninis it's the perfect meaty sandwich leftovers never tastes so good
you'll want something to soak up all the sauce from the chicken cacciatore lemon parsley bruschetta is perfect before I start my lemon bruschetta I need to get my cookies out good good all right there beautiful pale golden color all around the edges they smell so good I can smell the chocolate it's still warm and sizzling all right I'm gonna start my lemon bruschetta and I'm gonna start by taking this ciabatta bread it's very rustic looking and what I love about it is it's actually a lot lighter inside then you would think it is not as doughy as other types of breads are it's got a nice outer crust she's about six slices or so and you know I'm cutting it on an angle like this makes it easier to sort of bind them to just like that just gonna cut these in half all right pop them on the grill I feel the grill is hot I'm just gonna put together some lemon juice and some olive oil and traditionally that's what they did with bruschetta they just rub some uh fresh extra-virgin olive oil over it and the warmth of the bread absorbs the olive oil and it's fantastic so a couple tablespoons of lemon juice and olive oil extra virgin so a couple tablespoons of lemon juice and a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a little bit of salt for flavoring let's back together and you know when you have risk if ten restaurants there's so many different toppings you can do it with chopped tomatoes you could do it um quits that cannellini beans are just one of my favorites and even with fennel all sorts of stuff just gonna peel my garlic because as soon as the bread comes off the grill I'm gonna rub it with this garlic all right let's see if the bread is ready yeah there we are just nice and toasty well baby one for me all right I need about another minute on that side now I'm gonna chop some fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley because we're gonna just sprinkle a little bit on top of the brisket to give it a nice color just a rough chop believe that right there now I want to start with one of my other rustic favorites smashed potatoes drizzled with olive oil and tangy Parmesan cheese I'm gonna use red potatoes I'm using baby potatoes so I'm just gonna slice them and cut them in half and we're gonna boil them it's such a time-saver to do two things at once so while my bread is grilling I'm preparing my potatoes what I like about these potatoes is the thin skin and their waxy er then russet potatoes so they have less starch in them they're perfect for boiling and make fantastic mashed potatoes they come white or red I happen to love the color and I'm gonna leave the skin on and these red potatoes are also known as boiling potatoes so see there's that there's the key to knowing that they're great for boiling but these back in here and grab my bread yep my bread is ready the bread is warm and I've just cut the little end off the garlic and I rub it and the warmth of the bread starts to melt the garlic so aromatic it's so fantastic all right now just brush a little bit of the olive oil and lemon juice mixture just must sprinkle a tiny bit of parsley and the parsley is just for beauty just look a little more attractive all right those look great and now it's time to get the potatoes in the water now I have cold water and I'm gonna add all my potatoes in and bring them up to a boil up next I'm gonna make my amazing smashed Parmesan potatoes
I started shopping some vegetables for my Moroccan inspired Swiss chard rolls these are super yummy and they're sort of savory and sweet all in one there very filling and satisfying but they're also very light and beautiful and kind of transport you to another place when you eat them chop up two carrots and an onion here you want to give it a nice flavor I know I think a lot of times people get a little scared when you talk about things like the vegetarian style dishes but they can have a lot of flavor it's just about giving lots of different ingredients so we're gonna start with the basic which is onion carrots and reinforce a little bit of an onion flavor a little bit milder though we're gonna add a few scallions and I like the scallions a little more exotic we're gonna add tofu to this little coconut milk curry and cumin to add warmth next some garlic we're just gonna use one clove of garlic so not a lot of garlic I don't want the garlic to overpower the the warm spices that we're gonna add to this you know my mom's a vegetarian so I'm always looking to create new vegetarian dishes that look really pretty and kind of make your mouth water perfect just chop that up next we're gonna add some ginger slightly spicy but not in a heat Conaway more than a warming kind of way I'm just gonna grate it adds a little exotic flavor to the Swiss Charles take all off the other side let's give this a nice little stir stir picking up mmm that ginger smells good plus ginger really is great for the body alright so now for some spices we're gonna add some cumin and some curry powder so we're gonna start with good old cumin very warming spices we're gonna use one teaspoon of ground cumin and then two teaspoons of curry powder and curry powder is a mixture of lots of different spices it's got cinnamon it's got turmeric for color it's got a little cardamom and what you want to do is sort of toast them ever so slightly we're gonna add 1/2 a cup of golden raisins for a little sweetness and a little chewiness these are Jade's favorite yeah a little bit of tofu so instead of adding meat I'm gonna add tofu for a little bit of protein bring add six ounces of extra firm tofu and you definitely want extra firm tofu so that it holds its shape it's a bean curd used a lot in Asian cooking cut it and kind of cubes nothing too big nothing too small give it a nice color and flavor too next we're gonna add a little bit of coconut milk you want to make this um slightly creamy so instead of adding cheese we're gonna add coconut milk instead it gives it a nice sweetness as well as making it nice and creamy and we're just gonna add a half a cup of coconut milk so not a lot and then give it a nice mix to add a little bit of body to this I just cooked half a cup of brown rice and half a cup of wild rice and I cooked in a little vegetable broth and that little piece of ginger I like the combo because it gives it a bit of nuttiness and texture difference but you could use just brown rice you can even use white rice if you want to or all wild rice it's kind of up to you and toss the rice right into the veggies and tofu and coconut milk and allow it all to heat through and give the rice a chance to absorb all those flavors now I just want to give us a quick little taste to make sure the seasoning is just right go back yes mcleaney I got to raising a little sweetness and he's a little salt little pepper hmm can turn that off we've got our water boiling we're gonna grab some Swiss chard leaves you buy Swiss chard at the grocery store very similar to like romaine lettuce except a lot greener and what I like to do is cut the rib out because I want to roll these with a filling and then for this purpose I don't want them to be too long so I cut the leaves in half then what I do is I place them in some boiling salted water to make them a little bit softer I've got my baking dish that I already greased and at the bottom of the baking dish I'm gonna put some spicy tomato sauce a little out of yata and I like the spiciness with the creaminess of the filling but you could definitely use just regular tomato sauce if you don't put the spiciness and we'll just spread it out and this just helps the Swiss chard rows so that they don't stick to the bottom of the pan move this over we're gonna grab a plate lined with some paper towel and my tongs they only need to be in the water for like 30 seconds and as you're doing this you can put more into the water take the paper and blot this was chard we can take it and put it on the board now I want to do is just take some of the filling and put it right there and roll it up and see how easy it is to roll it up once you blanched it a little bit and then I land it right on top of the tomato sauce

my husband Todd is surfing today with his friend Chuck so while the guys do that I'm gonna prepare a hearty meal to warm them up after an action-packed day on the water white bean and chicken chili cannellini beans Swiss chard and layers of spice for a fiery kick cheddar and scallion bread crunchy ciabatta smothered in cheese it's especially great dipped in chili and for a cool finish limoncello granita it's sweet creamy and silky smooth a casually elegant meal that appeals to the surfer and everyone certain point first up a lemon simple syrup for my limoncello granita it's really easy water sugar some lemon zest and lemon juice bring it to a boil and let it cool down completely now that the lemon simple syrup is cooled we're ready to start a limoncello granita add the lemon simple syrup right into the food processor it's so great because the food processor do all the work for us and it's really important to let that cool completely so that way you can put it directly into the freezer and it won't curdle the cheese so we're gonna add some mascarpone cheese now this isn't a traditional thing for granitas because usually it's just a little bit of flavoring and a simple syrup but mascarpone cheese really does make it super creamy and light usually with a granita you have to scrape it every hour after you put it in the freezer not with this one you put it in for hours you let it sit it comes out and it's ready to eat so we're gonna add 1 cup of mascarpone cheese and you want to make sure that the mascarpone is at room temperature so that way everything blends together really nicely then for the star of my granita my limoncello now limoncello is a lemon liqueur it's made of fermented lemon peel and it's made in Italy but every Italian region has their own way of making it believe it or not and really the difference is just how many lemons you actually use to make it and how long you ferment it for we're using half a cup of limoncello then nowadays you can find it everywhere so it's really easy and it's really really good and just a pinch of salt just to bring out the flavors of the lemon and you know granita is very similar to a sorbet and this one is actually going to be more similar to a sherbert in that it's creamy and that's it so the food processor does all the work then we grab just a glass baking dish and then you just pour it right in there nice and creamy thick and frothy you pop it in the freezer for four hours and it's all done is that easy I love it so now we're gonna go from cold to hot I'm gonna start with my white bean and chicken chili it's very hearty and really yummy and I think it's gonna be perfect for Todd and his friend when they come back from spending the whole day in the water I want to heat up my Dutch oven and while that heats up grab my knife and I want to do I was trying to chop an onion and four garlic cloves cuz this is kind of an Italian this is known as a sofrito that's sort of the flavorings and kind of flavors the whole chili and I really like making chili but the white bean chili for me is my favorite I love white beans cannellini beans because they're super creamy and it depends on how you like your onion and I like it chopped up now it's gonna cook for a while so the onion will fall apart no matter what but remember the smaller you chop it the quicker it's gonna cook into the pan see it's nice and hot and that's what you want and I like lots of onion in it and once it's cooked down I need to come sweet so it's really good then four garlic cloves and I know it sounds like a lot but you really need it especially because chicken can sometimes not have a lot of flavors you want to add a lot of flavoring to it three and four it's funny you know when you have a garlic head that is super tight it just means that the cloves are very very fresh now I like to mince the garlic but you can also leave it whole if you want to and then take it out there we go close now we'll give it a quick little chop and a little bit of salt just want the onion and the garlic to sweat you know to really cook down softly and slowly it's really good and some black pepper give it a little stir you just want to cook this couple minutes just until the onion starts to soften and you can smell the garlic it's something great about garlic a minute and hit something hot it just feels roma fills the whole kitchen so let's let that sit for just a minute and cook down a bit I'm gonna grab my spices so I need chilli powder oregano cumin and fennel seeds and this is the secret and it's what makes it really really good so we'll start with chili powder we need its tablespoons of teaspoons 2 teaspoons of chili powder now the chili powder is classic in a chili and it gives it that nice deep color then we've got one tablespoon of dried oregano and I like to oregano it's nice and earthy so we've got one tablespoon of dried oregano and then we've got the cumin two tablespoons of cumin and the cumin is what adds the warmth not a spiciness but nice warmth and again it's a classic ingredient and we're just basically toasting the spices and the herbs just because it's gonna add more flavor to the chili and I love doing that and one tablespoon of fennel seeds it's kinda like licorice and that's it those are all the flavorings so we're done with that and you just want to toast them for like I don't know a minute or so is enough you know that's what they do in Indian cooking too they toast all of the spices that just brings out all the flavors so now I just make a little room at the bottom of the pan add a little bit more olive oil just because we're gonna add the chicken and chicken doesn't have a lot of fat so it needs a little help otherwise it'll burn and we've got two pounds of ground white each chicken just take that off and you can use any kind of meat you want turkey beef pork combination anything but I'm sticking to the chicken the chicken in the white bean I'm liking that and break that up let's go ahead and cook it and break it we're gonna add a little bit more salt just to flavor the chicken cuz like I said the chicken needs lots of flavoring alright so we're gonna let the chicken continue to cook and I'm not done yet I gather a lot more flavorings to add to this chili party layers of beans and veggies make this chili a stick-to-your-ribs favorite

my steak is nice and cooked with it back nice color and what I want to do is take it off the grill pan I'll turn the grill pan off and I cooked it for about eight minutes on each side so it's nice and medium-rare just the way I like it but it's really important to let the meat sit for a few minutes before you cut into it so all the juices can redistribute that way you get a nice moist piece of steak when you cut into it it's nice and juicy all right so while that's it's I'm gonna make the topping it's kind of a mix between a vinaigrette and a sauce so 1/2 a cup of black olives also garlic so one garlic clove so the garlic in there then three tablespoons of red wine vinegar you need a little acidity to balance the flavors then to bring it all together I'm going to add some Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons and I love the Dijon mustard it's a little more elegant have more flavor than regular mustard a little salt of course right and some pepper now we're going to change it up a little bit I'm gonna add two different oils vegetable oil and olive oil six tablespoons or so of vegetable oil and six tablespoons of olive oil so we split it because the oil balances out the acidity from the red wine vinegar okay so now I just want to give this a quick little whirl okay so now for some freshness and some green parsley I'm just gonna add it right in there cuz I'm gonna let the blender do all the work couple tablespoons or so fresh parsley alright so the vinaigrettes done now it's time to cut the meat there we go and I like to take a ribeye and slice pieces out of it goes there's no way I can eat this entire steak take our plate and load me up and a little vinaigrette see nice and thick and see that's what I mean it's kind of like between a vinaigrette and a sauce a piece of my focaccia and of course we can't forget about the orzo there we go guys oh look at that cheese oh I think my mouth is now just watering from 1 to dig in see nice and pink all right so let's go with the meat first since it's nice and hot perfect little bite hmmm that crush when you earned a salt and pepper so good like around this try this hmmm mushrooms and cheese then we've got the focaccia I got a grape it just bursts alright this is the perfect Steakhouse meal but you can't go to steak house and not have dessert so I have the perfect refreshing light dessert to cap this all off the perfect end to a steakhouse meal is something light and refreshing the citrus semi-fitted they'll end any meal on a high note I want to start by making the custard so we're gonna measure half a cup of sugar and we're making a citrus semifreddo so I'm gonna add lemon juice and lime juice let's take a nice lemon you need about a quarter cup of lemon sometimes that means half a lemon sometimes it means the full lemon there we go this one we're gonna use the whole lemon this is semifreddo it just means an Italian half frozen it's even better than ice cream in my opinion so we're also gonna add a couple tablespoons of lime juice and this is the real kicker we're gonna add some women cello couple tablespoons of limoncello now limoncello is an Italian liqueur it's made of the famous Sorrento lemons a little sugar and alcohol limoncello and a pinch of salt need the salt to bring out all the flavors of the citrus and we're also going to add of course egg yolks right in order to make a custard you need the egg yolks so eight egg yolks I've already separated them start mixing that stuff up and adding one egg yolk at a time and that's what makes the custard so rich are the egg yolks there we go okay and now what I want to do is cook the custard over a double boiler so I have a little bit of water that's simmering you just want the steam that comes off the simmering water to cook the custard and with this mixer we're just gonna keep mixing this for about five minutes until it's thick and creamy
I'm creating my pecorino for my three cheese and artichoke Casone I'm gonna make individual cuts Tony today I'm grading about a half a cup of pecorino and the pecorino has a nice sort of salty bite to it it's not aged as long as parmesan so it has a little bit more of a salty bite and it's so good in here so we're just going to put the pecorino directly into the food processor we need to also grate some fontina cheese about 1/3 of a cup of fontina the best kind of fun FINA comes from northern Italy so if you're looking for fontina try and get the northern Italian brands only because they tend to be creamier and almost buttery and fontina is one of those cheese's that melts beautifully it's one of the best melting cheese's but it does have a lot more flavor than mozzarella which is why I like it for the cut Sony it's a semi-soft cheese so I like to put it in the fridge and get it nice and cold before I grade it that way grates really nicely so yeah maybe eat and snack on to just add it right in there next a little bit of ricotta cheese so 1/2 a cup of ricotta nice and soft you need a little bit hold the filling together we got the cheese then we're gonna add a little bit of lemon we're gonna zest a whole lemon and then we're just gonna juice half of it now the lemon works really well with the artichokes okay so lemons in next we're gonna add four ounces of frozen thought-out artichoke hearts they add texture and flavor I love them sort of a staple frozen ingredient for me we're also gonna add some sun-dried tomatoes I'm just gonna give them a rough chop only because they don't have as much moisture as the artichoke so they tend to take a little bit longer to kind of break down nice and sweet some salt season it really well a little bit of pepper so let's just blend this all together until you get a nice chunky filling now let's just taste this make sure she's right mmm I love all that cheese honestly the combo the pecorino on the fontina is divine okay filling is done so let's start rolling out our dough so I have one dough ball that's about a pound and I cut it in four because I'm gonna make individual cuts oniy you can definitely make one big one if you wanted to so what I do is I take the ball and then just want to roll it out into a circle and you can get store-bought dough anywhere these days okay take some of the filling nice and chunky we're gonna put it with the air may be a little bit more I need a little bit of egg white that I just beat and what I want to do is just brush all the sides and this is gonna seal the counts on it okay so then you take one side and you fold it over and then I like to just fold over the sides I'm keeping it kind of rustic and then you want to pick it up move it over to our baking sheet just put a little bit of cornmeal give it sort of a little texture on the bottom then I take a paring knife and I create a little vent on the top so that all the moisture inside can come out then last but not least we're just going to drizzle a little bit of olive oil over the top to get a nice golden color what it bakes all right let's do our second one we're gonna bake these at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes until they're golden and the cheese inside is hot melted and gooey look how gorgeous my calzone is you can see all the filling in there and all the color I'm gonna take a piece of this nice and cheesy and this meeting us from the out jokes and the sweetness screws on our Tomatoes mm-hmm all right up next a sweet and creamy treat my citrus gelato a cool and creamy Italian dessert with a California twist
every working lunch should end on a high note this is a fantastic finishing touch you can feel good about a frothy chocolate espresso shake in Italy we like to finish our lunches with a little espresso so I thought it would be fun to turn the espresso into dessert and create a nice shake so I'm gonna start by adding 1/2 a cup of water to my pan and a quarter cup of this gourmet hot chocolate mix we're gonna add ass press o to the chocolate and create a nice mocha what I think is so nice at the end of a meal it kind of whips you up and it picks you up and it makes you feel good and you can keep working too which is really important we're gonna add 2 teaspoons of espresso powder right in there already smells good this is really yummy and then I just want to whisk it until the chocolate and the espresso have basically melted into the the water just like you would with a hot chocolate there we go and that's it I'm just gonna let it sit and cool for just a minute here and in the meantime I'm gonna grab my low-fat vanilla frozen yogurt and we're just gonna add the vanilla frozen yogurt into the blender and to make it even better we're gonna add one cup of fat-free milk so I'm kind of keeping this on the light side too and the milk will also make a nice smooth mixture so you don't have any clumps and to give it a little extra vanilla flavor two teaspoons of vanilla extract yeah finally the chocolate espresso mixture right in there and then you blend it all together and I've got 4 8 ounce glasses now this is a pretty rich shake so this should be just enough to keep you going there we are what got cute that is and that's it got you a little dessert that look good little mocha let's chocolate on espresso nice and chilly nice and frothy mmm so good and the thing is we all live busy lives but it's so nice to make a satisfying light easy lunch and it shows everybody that you really care and that's most important

meal a slice of chicken and orzo frittata for lunch is a great start to the rest of your day the first thing I want to do for my focaccia is start cooking my orzo and I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of orzo in here that's about almost half the box and see orzo they look like little grains of barley there little pasta which is gonna be perfect for my Futaba it only takes about 8 minutes to cook and we still want it to be al dente just like regular pasta so it's cooking for 8 minutes in salted boiling water all right while that cooks I'm gonna get started on my eggs and we're gonna crack 6 eggs now a frittata is basically like an Italian version of an omelet and it's open-faced so it's a lot easier in my opinion to make and the great thing is you can have it for lunch you could have it for breakfast you can have a for dinner really anything you want last egg here we go just give it a quick little beat just to sort of break the yolks okay now for the really yummy stuff in here they got the cheese now I need 1/3 of a cup of ricotta cheese whole milk okay just like that dump that in there and we're gonna add some creme fraiche now creme fraiche is very similar to sour cream it's a little bit thicker than sour cream it doesn't have the Tang so it just has all of that yummy creaminess we're gonna give that a quick little mix now I'm gonna add some scallions now I love a little bit of an onion flavor in my frittata so the scallions will add that little bit of a mild onion flavor also gonna add some flat Italian parsley I don't know about 1/4 cup or so you could add a little more a little less depending on how much parsley you like parsley in and next I'm going to add some roasted red peppers see here I'm just gonna use one and a half I also love the color that vibrant red color in there there we go and we're gonna mix this all together and the colors the green with the red see look how chunky that gets alright that's done let me just check on the orzo oh it looks good it's the perfect little strainer I love it we're just going to let the orzo cool for a couple of minutes before I add it to the eggs because I don't want it to start cooking the eggs if it's hot and you add it to room temperature eggs and start to cook them I don't want that to happen I want the eggs to cook evenly in the oven so let that cool for a minute and now I'm going to add a little bit of salt and some freshly ground black pepper to my frittata and the thing that makes this frittata so meaty and really makes it feel like a lunch chicken so I need two chicken breasts and I basically go to the store and I get a rotisserie chicken when you cook it rotisserie style it keeps the meat nice and moist I keep a rotisserie chicken in the fridge and that way I can make lots of different things okay you can make pasta salad you can make your frittata you can make chicken salad and so we're gonna use the breasts for the Futaba just cut those out just like that see how juicy they are mm-hmm and I can use the thighs and the legs for other things pasta salad chicken salad whatever you want now I'm gonna take the skin off I don't need the skin we're just gonna do that and you can either cut the chicken into cubes or you can shred it whatever you want I'm just gonna make this really easy just cut it up into cubes mix that together just like that see now you got nice chunks of chicken in here Oh whoo this is gonna be so yummy colorful needy and fluffy and creamy the orzo has cooled and we'll just dump all of the orzo into the eggs look at that so good I love orzo my mom used to add it to soups like chicken soup it's kind of fun because it's so small it's perfect for this big data now grab my baking dish and the orzo chicken all the veggies everything in there I put the baking dish on a lined baking sheet just because it makes it easier transport this baking dish in and out of the oven and makes cleanup that much easier 375 degrees for 25 minutes then I'm gonna pop it under the broiler for 5 minutes just to get the top nice and golden brown and we can eat it oh my goodness it smells so good you really smell the Scalia so now I just want to cut myself a little piece oh you can hear how create is even when you cut into it there we go so now taste that mmm mmm the chicken and the orzo make it super meaty nice and creamy a little bit of hint from the green onions you know what's so great about this dish you could eat it hot cold or room temperature and with a side salad it makes the perfect lunch
chicken cacciatore has gotten a bad rap in America but my recipe recaptures it's bright authentic roots before I get started my chicken cacciatore I want to check on my cookies they've been baking for 30 minutes at 350 degrees take a look perfect so we've got biscotti dough flavored with anise which I can smell it smells so good and chocolate chips I'm gonna let those cool before I cut them and bake them again in the meantime I'm gonna start on my chicken cacciatore and the first thing I want to do is season my four chicken breasts and four chicken thighs some freshly ground black pepper Khachaturian basically is like cooked in a Hunter style so it's very rustic and a lot of times it tends to be an overly sweet sauce and an overcooked dry piece of chicken well this chicken cacciatore recipe will change your line and make you fall in love this dish again all right all the sides are seasoned let's add some regular olive oil to our saute pan because we're gonna Brown them up raise our heat to about a medium you want the pan nice and hot to get it nice and brown on the outside now I'm gonna cook the chicken in a thin layer of flour and the flour will help keep the chicken moist and give it a nice brown coating in northern Italy they'd like to make this dish with onions and carrots celery and southern Italy they like to use anchovies olives sometimes chili peppers so I'm gonna Brown this side and I'm gonna flip them over and brown the other side and I'm gonna get all my ingredients together for my fantastic sauce lower my heat just a little bit and I'm gonna chop my ingredients so I need some onion just rough chop this is rustic cooking you don't have to worry about sides anything else I'm going to add a little bit more oil so that there's enough oil in the pan to coat the vegetables so they can cook and I'm going to raise my heat to about a medium and we're gonna add our onions these three ingredients the onions the peppers and the garlic are the flavoring ingredients movie sort of the base flavors garlic that's a lot of chicken so maybe three so just a quick little chop there we go and into the pan the onion acts as a bed so that the garlic doesn't burn when you add it to the pan a little bit of salt and the peppers and I'm going to use one big red bell pepper you could also use green if you wanted to they're not quite as sweet because the red bell peppers are the ripened version of the green bell peppers so we're just gonna cut our bell peppers we'll add that to our onions and garlic doesn't that look good a little bit more salt just to release all the moisture and all the juices out of the vegetables and some fresh ground black pepper all right I'm gonna let this saute a couple of minutes just until the onions are fragrant and the garlic's favourite and the vegetables start sort of wilt and the onions will become translucent I'm going to use a can of chopped tomatoes and I'm using canned tomatoes because they have a lot of juice a lot more juice than fresh tomatoes have and that's what's gonna make this dish luscious like saucy consistency can of tomatoes some white wine we're using chicken lighters we're going to use some white wine some chicken broth and some dried oregano and the dried oregano is lemony and it's sort of earthy and it makes this dish rustic and it gives it that rustic taste and now some capers I'm using capers are preserved in white wine vinegar they kind of give it a tangy taste it counterbalances the sweetness of the peppers we'll bring that up to a boil just for a minute I'm ready to add my chicken we'll put the breast and the thighs back into the sauce and the flour from the chicken it's going to help thicken the sauce alright I'm gonna let this simmer for about 20 minutes until the chicken is all cooked through and now I'm gonna go check on my biscotti we're gonna cut them about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in thickness there we go okay so now we're gonna put a back on our baking sheet and they're gonna bake at 350 degrees until they're like a pale golden color on top all right they're ready to go in the oven 15 more minutes that's good
when you're planning to host a working lunch keep it simple and satisfying this side dish has potatoes cooked in chicken broth and lemon juice so they absorb all the flavors then I toss them with tangy lemon zest fresh basil and olive oil lemon basil potatoes have a light summery flavor that makes them a perfect side dish usually I like to boil my potatoes in water but to make this recipe extra special I like to do it in chicken broth and we're using baby potatoes the little red potatoes and I love them really because I can cut them in half and all of a sudden they're bite-sized they have a really thin delicate skin so I don't have to peel them when I have people over for lunch especially when it's a working lunch when you're having a chicken sandwich and a salad you need something to sort of round out the whole meal and this potato this potato dish really does that and now I'm gonna take the potatoes and put them directly into my pan and we're gonna measure 2 cups of chicken broth and I like it cuz it's really gonna flavor the potatoes the potatoes basically absorb whatever you cook them in and so that's the point of cooking them in the chicken broth just make some extra extra special so pour that right over the potatoes just like that we're gonna add half a cup of lemon juice so just roll and cut the lemons and basically just add all the juice right in here okay there we go now I'm gonna add two tablespoons of olive oil and the reason I'm adding the olive oil is to keep them kind of nice and silky kind of gives them a little bit of a free flavor 800 salt and some freshly ground black pepper so then you have to bring the mixture up to a boil and once it's boiling you turn back down to a simmer and put the lid on so my potatoes are cooked I've drained them and I can smell that lemon flavor that's why it's so great to cook them with all that lemon juice because it just kind of permeates everything it smells so good all right so we're gonna add two more teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil right on top just to make them extra shiny and pretty and really fruity and we're also gonna zest some lemon right on top of the potatoes just because I'd love to see those little yellow flecks right on top of the potatoes and because it really does bring out all of the flavors pan for a finishing touch a little freshness little mint eNOS some basil and I love seeing the color too you know you see that little bit of green it kind of brightens up a potato dish I just kind of put that right on top and then just kind of want to toss them so that the olive oil and the lemon zest and the basil kind of coats each and every potato half okay so pretty it smells so good so now grab the fork they're so lettering is so good that freshness from the lemon zest fruity olive oil and the basil Yami alright up next I've got a great dessert cuz it's dessert slash drink it's my frothing chocolate and special shake
while I was waiting for the butter to melt I got a head start on my lobster tails and basically all I did was take a pair of scissors and cut down the back of the lobster just like this and then I take a metal skewer and I just run it down right the bottom side just like that that way the lobster tails aren't gonna curl up so it's going to look really pretty and basically by taking the scissors and cutting down the back of the lobster it makes it easier to eat later on and when I brush it with a lemon butter it kind of seeps into the lobster all right so I'm done with my lobsters I'm gonna wash my hands okay so now I'm going to show you a little trick there grab a spoon and now as the butters melted you can see that the milk solids separate from the butter fat and they rise to the top kind of like a floating iceberg so you just basically skim it off the top just like that we'll grab a measuring cup and I pour the melted butter into the measuring cup and you let it cool for a couple minutes and then when it's cooled you'll see that all the the remaining milk solids will be at the bottom so you just pour it and leave that in there in the meantime when I get my lemons three lemons and we're gonna zest three lemon because we're gonna really infuse the lemon into the butter grab a zester and here we go it kind of enhances the flavor of the lobster not traditional but citrusy bright and super yummy that's it we got lots and lots of lemon zest here okay these three and we pour the melted butter on top of lemon zest and when you pour it you just don't want to pour the whole thing and then that's it cuz all the milk solids whatever was left over is settled on the bottom so you don't wanna use that and the heat from the butter brings out the flavor in the lemon zest and it makes it nice and lemony there we go okay now I'll show you what I do I take a lobster tail put it down on the tinfoil and I pour some of the warm lemon butter right over the top and then I like to open up the shell just a little bit just like that and kind of brush the lemon butter right inside of it just so it really soaks into the lobster meat that way when it cooks it's gonna be so good succulent and it's gonna have that lemony buttery kind of flavor to it there we go okay Pat down and wrap the lobster tail all right I'm gonna get the rest finished up and prepped and then some packing tips to make this lobster bait

one of the most legendary regions of Italy is Tuscany it's inspired generations of writers and chefs Tuscan cooking is simple and delicious like do Cocteau a chocolaty dome-shaped cake of whipped cream and nuts and Florentine chicken and a bed of sauteed spinach a Tuscan hallmark beans is showcased with aromatic herbs tomatoes and prosciutto these dishes are your ticket to a day under the Tuscan Sun my favorite part of any meal is dessert an easy Tuscan classic is some cocoa I'm gonna start with the outside of the dome and so that it doesn't stick add a little trick I'm gonna spray this glass bowl with this nonstick spray I'm gonna line it with some plastic wrap that way when I go to invert it it slips right out two strips of plastic wrap should be enough we'll put it right inside there and one more okay there we go want some overhang so that we can wrap it up later on okay so there's the plastic run bowl next part my pound cake I'm just using store-bought pound cake little 12 ounce loaf and we're going to cut it in about a third of an inch slices you don't want to make them too thick because they won't be as pliable you won't be able to sort of mold them and you don't want to make them too thin because they'll fall apart and you know pound cake got its name because it used to originally be made of a pound of butter a pound of flour and a pound of sugar and of course the legs and these days its flavored with all sorts of things I mean you've got marbled pound cakes with chocolate inside you've got any variation you could possibly think of Zucco's a traditional Tuscan dessert the people of Florence love it because it resembles the dome on top of the main Cathedral in Florence so we're just gonna cut all of these in triangles you can use brioche for this cake but I love pound cake just because I love that buttery sweetness it's perfect for this dessert now we're gonna line the bottom of the cake and what we're gonna do is place them so all of the triangle pieces touch each other like a windmill now all we do is fit the rest in like a puzzle and I'll sort of mold them in there growing up making toccata was so much fun and assembling the puzzle was the best part that looks good now we'll save these and we'll put them on the top I'm going to brush the pound cake is brandy I have here so I'm using about a quarter cup or so and you're just gonna give it a quick little brush it's easier to brush the triangles with brandy at this point when they're already in the bowl otherwise they could fall apart in your hand I've got two fillings that I'm gonna make there to make this cake fantastic we've got a chocolate filling which is six ounces of bittersweet chocolate that I've already melted and one cup of heavy whipping cream which I've already whipped we're going to put those two together and then after that we're going to make another filling so I'm going to add about a quarter of a cup of the whipped cream to the chocolate you don't want to do it all at once that's sort of the idea of folding ingredients that way also we keep some of the air in the whipped cream so we'll add another half of the amount of the whipped cream into the chocolate you want to do this part pretty quickly because the chocolate cream will firm up as it cools and see I'm just turning the bowl and lifting the ingredients and you don't have to worry about it all becoming one uniform color it's okay to see a little bit of whipped cream inside kind of like a mousse so now take my bowl back and I just add the chocolate whipped cream mixture a little bit at a time and you just want to brush it up against the pound cake gently with the pound cake so you don't break it I'm also gonna make another filling that has almonds in it and the combination of the flavors of the chocolate in the almond are going to be perfect in this dish and we're ready to make the second filling we're gonna take another cup of heavy whipping cream and we're gonna whip it with powdered sugar and almond extract but first I want to start whipping it just a little bit before I add the powdered sugar otherwise I can't get the air into it what's up pretty quickly the traditional filling for this cake is sweetly whipped cream with chocolate shavings and various nuts like hazel nuts or like almonds which is what I'm in use 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and a little bit at a time powdered sugar melts more easily in the whipped creams and granulated sugar all right now we're ready for the almond extract we're going to add about half a teaspoon an almond extract has a wonderful fragrance and aroma so you don't want to add too much because it could sort of overpower the whipped cream so we've got that I'm gonna add in some toasted slivered almonds and I've toasted them just to bring out the flavor and give them a little bit of crunch so again folding the almonds in just turn the bowl and lift the ingredients I'm just gonna put this filling right inside okay so all I need to do now is brush the rest of the pound cake with brandy and then fold up all the plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for three hours or up to a day you
when I make comfort food I want to treat myself and this next dish is hard to top I layer thin leaves of cooked pasta with a seafood salad of crab meat peas and chives as a finishing touch I add a flavorful sprinkle of lemon zest it all stacks up into a delicious crab salad Napoleon so we've rolled out the rest of our dough and we've already cooked it we have little sheets just like lasagna sheets we cooked them in boiling salted water for about two minutes now see Daffy will you do me a favor now we're gonna build these Napoleon's it's sort of like a cold lasagna Yeah right out baking without baking it right all right so dha'fi will you cut those into thirds and you sort of build this individually on each plate and I am going to make the filling just we're gonna make sure I do this right because I don't want to be any which way you do it's an Effie it's all good now I'm adding some mayonnaise yes just plain old store-bought mayonnaise and we're gonna add some defrosted peas in some lump crab and I'm just gonna borrow your lemon zester yep and then just to lighten up the flavors of the crab and just sort of I don't know I love the zing of the lemon zest it's got wonderful sort of essential oils in the actual I never used lemon I'm gonna start putting it in everything it's what's delicious before I love it I love lemon I always have a big bowl of lemons it just live-ins up the flavors do that and as soon as you're done with the knife I need a knife from Norris I just want to roll the lemon and then we're gonna use some lemon juice so lemon zest and lemon juice on this I love lemons and fish together don't you think I'm looking at how you are yes I'm going wrapping wrapping the the Pips said if you do me a favor will you chop the chives for me sure and the chives add a little bit of that very mild onion flavor that I really like in here I love chives the chives with the crab with the lemon the peas for some color and a little bit of texture and of course the mayonnaise well that sort of brings it all together sort of the binding agent and just mix it all together that looks good and you can make the filling and the pasta all ahead of time but all you have to do at the last minute is assembling it looks like you spent all day look so gourmet I love it do you keep it in the in the Bridget dress you can throw the tribes in here and we also need a little black pepper all right let's reserve that for after it'll make it look really pretty out top okay so maybe let's yeah a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper although the mayonnaise has salt in it I like to add just a smidgen more salt you like pepper so she's gonna have like the whole plate I liked it but I could see it when the sauce is white okay could you make this with shrimp also some yeah you could do you could do it really loud perfect that's good yeah we put them all over there just like that yeah you can do shrimp salad chicken salad really you could do anything you wanted I just love the crab I just think it's different and it's yummy you want them all one on top of the other do you want to we can do anything you want so we'll just do one like that be there and then no no you got your own spoon over there spooning you spoon yours so a little bit of the mixture you can put a little or a lot whatever you want I'm gonna put a little bit more because I like it I'm now she's gonna put pepper in between each later on yeah there you go now I'm gonna grab my next one okay just like that and then I just put a little bit more filling just a tag for some color right on top and then mine is not as thick as yours move I like to pass them okay so then I just want to do this just a little bit of the lemon zest you want a little lemon zest for life and will you put a little pepper on top of mine look how pretty that looks see that look nice very fresh the yummy yummy chives a little bit oniony and very unique different yeah all right so we've got one more dish to make I don't get too full because I got a little sweet Passyunk next mmm where's my fettuccine degenerate chocolate
how are you good to see you - thank you it's been a while but I need a couple of things sure doing something special with cheese's lots of different recipes using lots of different cheeses who doesn't love cheese I know I do all kinds sharp buttery super mild the gorgonzola the Gruyere feta fontina so today I'm gonna make three recipes using cheese as the star ingredient turkey meatloaf with feta and sun-dried tomatoes who knew that meatloaf could be so exotic and the feta cheese as a salty bite cheesy baked bottom three cheese's and a golden crust the ultimate comfort food crostata with apples walnuts and gorgonzola a sweet soft gorgonzola makes this dish irresistible three cheesy recipes all different and all delicious this is just a good excuse to taste it off so we're gonna start with the dough and the reason I want to start with my crostata is because the dough needs to sit and chill in the refrigerator for about a half hour before I fill it then bake it off so we're gonna do one and a half cups of all-purpose flour and you want to keep in mind that when you're making any kind of pastry dough that you really and truly measure very well all your ingredients so you can get the right texture that you're looking for now we need have a teaspoon of salt fine salt and then we need one tablespoon of sugar and I'm gonna pulse it all together so now let's grab the cheese and the butter three tablespoons of butter it's got to be unsalted and it's got to be cold as cold as you can get it so I kind of work quickly and diligently and cutting it into little cubes and put it in the food processor because the longer I handle the butter the more it starts to melt from the heat of my fingers and the reason you want the butter to be nice and cold is because when the dough is actually baking in the oven the chunks of butter kind of fill up with air and those little pockets of air is what creates a nice flaky dough that's why you want to keep it nice and cold we'll just drop it right in here and give it a quick little pulse just to combine the butter initially so now lemon juice and a little bit of ice water here we go we're just gonna had one and a half tablespoons of lemon juice a little bit of acid in the actual pie dough is really good it keeps the dough really tender and that's what you want make sure that seeds don't go in there and they did it okay so we've got the lemon in there and we need three tablespoons of ice water keep it nice and cold because the water will keep the butter cold as well that's why you want ice water but you don't want to add the ice so you just want to make sure you measure it out and that's three tablespoons that in there give it a quick pulse and now for the creamy part mascarpone cheese and the mascarpone cheese is light and fluffy so that's exactly what it's going to do so the lemon juice will keep it tender the Muscat point of cheese will keep it soft okay half a cup just kind of put it in the flour there we go it kinds of looking a little bit like cottage cheese curds just like that see big chunks like that now grab some plastic wrap yeah I put the dough right on the plastic wrap and then we're gonna chill it in the fridge drop it all down there just like that and then I kind of just put it together with my hands just wrap it up mold it together into a disc and then we'll put it in the fridge for half hour and then we'll roll it out and fill it so let's pop this in the fridge so if we're gonna start on the filling and I love the granny smith apples because they're nice and tart and they don't become mushy so what I want to do is peel and slice the apples then we're gonna cook them a little bit of sugar a little bit of cinnamon and butter let's skip the apples right in there I love the smell of apples cooking in butter really good really homey and rustic and that's exactly what this crostata is I just want to give it a toss here and let's add a quarter cup of sugar just right over that and a little bit of cinnamon so we're gonna do luminous sprinkle it about 3/4 of a teaspoon they'll spice little warmth gonna take about five minutes to soften the apples and then I'll show you how to put the crostata together and later I'll get started on my meatloaf a hearty main course with a cheesy twist
tonight I'm going to the Los Angeles Philharmonic the concert hall is a unique and stylish landmark so I want my pre concert dinner to stand out but I want to keep it easy too I'll serve a simple pasta rigatoni with an elegant squash puree and shrimp asparagus and zucchini cloody topped with shavings of pecorino romano for dessert a sweet cornmeal cake with aromatic rosemary and a thick balsamic syrup an apple and thyme martinis are fruity but not too sweet cocktail I've dressed up my menu for a perfect pre-concert dinner I want my guests to arrive at the concert with great memories of dinner so dessert has to be outstanding corn meal and rosemary cake with balsamic syrup isn't kid stuff and my guests are gonna love it so I'm gonna start with cornmeal I'm going to use half a cup of fine ground cornmeal then we need 1/2 a cup of cake flour now the cornmeal doesn't have any glutens in it so you have to add something to sort of give structure to the cake and that's what the flour does and now I need a little pinch of salt and some baking powder add one teaspoon of baking powder right into the flour there we go just like that I'm just gonna give it a quick little mix here so now that these are all mixed I'm gonna put this over here and we're gonna start with our wet ingredients so a stick of unsalted butter at room temperature then we need some confectioners sugar and we're gonna add one and a quarter cups of confectioner's sugar also known as powdered sugar and we're also gonna add half a teaspoon of vanilla and the vanilla extract just gives it a nice aromatic scent to it and some sweetness there we go clean the sugar and the butter together and now they're smoothing out so I'm ready to add my exit so I'm going to add two whole eggs and four yolks now the whole eggs kind of give the cake structure we'll just mix those together first and slowly the yolks get absorbed by the butter and the sugar so we're ready to start adding the egg yolks we're gonna do one egg yolk at a time and back to mixing then it's really important to add the egg yolks one at a time to really give it the butter and the sugar time to sort of absorb the yolks next egg yolk just like that so now I want to add a little bit of rosemary now that's what makes this dish special is the rosemary and adds kind of a piney flavor and essence to this cake so we're gonna add a minced rosemary and we're also gonna add some sour cream I know you're wondering sour cream like that well the sour cream adds sort of a Tang eNOS to the cake and also gives it really nice creaminess to so half a cup of sour cream so we'll mix those together it thickens it up - I love those little bits of rosemary inside of the batter it's so pretty now it's time to slowly add to the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients we're gonna add it in three batches there we go a little bit at a time and you want to mix it just enough so it's incorporated we're adding a little bit of air with the paddle attachment you don't want to add all the dry ingredients at once or else all of the air deflates and you don't get that nice tender light cake okay second batch its mixer and these stand mixers are awesome because they do all the work for you so all you have to do is flow the ingredients in there and they sort of mix it all up so now last addition there we go every gal now we're gonna pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for 35 minutes until the top is nice and golden and the sites pull away from the cake pan let's pop it in the oven okay while that cooks I have the topping to make I take a half a cup of balsamic vinegar give just regular store-bought balsamic vinegar what we're gonna do is we're gonna reduce it and we're gonna make a nice thick syrup to pour over the cornmeal cake and that's what makes us so yummy I'm gonna add 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar there we go so it's basically equal parts sugar and while Sonic's vinegar what do you want to do is bring it to a boil and then simmer it for 5 minutes the last thing I want to do it's add a sprig of rosemary and up next I'm going to show you a main course that is perfect for my special night out
I'm starting with the breadcrumbs which is the topic to my cauliflower and bacon gratin and I have some sliced sourdough bread just three slices and you want it to be day-old because we're going to toast it with a little bit of butter and you don't want it to fall apart so what I do is I put it at your processor and then we just so now a little bit of butter in our pan I'm going to toast the bread crumbs and a half a stick of unsalted butter and we'll put the stove about medium-high and just start melting the butter because we're gonna add the breadcrumbs and get them nice and toasty so just toss the bread right in there let it all out and okay so while these toasts up let's start on my cauliflower grab the cauliflower and just cut the bottom off and I really really like cauliflower and I think that it's a great way to get the kids to eat their vegetables is by just adding some bacon to it and some melted cheese put it in the oven and what kid doesn't like that it's almost like you're hiding the vegetables in the casserole itself so I just cut it in little florets it just breaks up on its own here we go and you know what you could do this with broccoli if you wanted just about anything and we're gonna blanch it and then it'll finish cooking in the oven the water for the cauliflower is boiling so I'm gonna add some salt just to flavor it let's just add all of the cauliflower right in the boiling water okay so while the cauliflower cooks let's get the cream and the cheese the grilled cheese we'll use in a little bit first we're going to start off with the cream and we're going to measure three quarters of a cup of heavy cream now the cream adds that sauce that we need for the cauliflower to continue cooking in the oven 3/4 of a cup there we go of heavy cream and then to that we add some flour we add one teaspoon of flour now the flour will thicken the sauce too so just one teaspoon of flour in there and that's all you need to get nice and thick and just give it a quick little whisk to kind of just dissolve the flour in the cream perfect so now we're gonna swap the bowls we are gonna take the florets out of the boiling water because again you only want to cook them for like a minute or two not too long because you don't want them to get mushy once you bake them in the oven so turn the water off there we go and this is known as blanching and the reason we're putting it in ice water is to bring the temperature down of the cauliflower so they stop cooking immediately otherwise if you just let them sit they'll cool off yes but they'll continue to cook and I don't want them to fall apart in the gret time I still want them to hold their shape well let those cool completely let's take a look at these though they're starting to toast up and boy oh boy it smells so good the butter with the bread mmm I need another minute or so in the meantime let's grate the cheese so I've got some Gruyere cheese and the Greer's has a nice sharp flavor so it works really well with the cauliflower so cauliflower is more of a mellow flavor and it melts beautifully it has a little bit of a sharp flavor to it but it's really creamy and it bakes really well and we need 1 cup of grated Gruyere happen that's gonna go in the cauliflower mixture and the other half is gonna go on top of the breadcrumbs so we get this nice crunchy cheesy crust on top of the cauliflower perfect we get the cheese so now we start building the grete so half of the Gruyere cheese goes inside and the other half we're gonna save it and put it on top then I add capers they add a nice tangy bite to it and then the bacon you can just chop it up you can rip it up with your fingers some salt got a C's in it and some pepper and just give it a quick mix here toss everything together and let's grab the cauliflower and the cauliflower should be cooled and again you want to just put it in cold water the cauliflower to bring down the temperature so it doesn't continue to cook here we go back over here toss it all together make sure that all the cauliflower is coated with some of the cream and bacon caper and cheese mixture bread crumbs are done turn off that and now grab the baking sheet and I have a buttered 8x8 baking sheet and I just toss everything in there there we go get all the bacon all the cheese everything take the bread crumbs that are now toasted and just put them right over the top some want to get away you just put them back in there and we finish it off with some more cheese right on top you get a nice cheesy crust and then to get that nice golden color I want to add a little bit of olive oil right over the top so a little bit of moisture for the cheese in the bread and now we bake it at 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes until it's bubbly crisp and the cheese's all melted on top this is gonna be good next I'll roll out the dough and start on my crispy flatbread with zucchini olives and even more cheese
you can't try to scan cooking without some kind of bean dish this is one of my favorites warm cannellini bean salad is a tuscan specialty that fits in anywhere what sets this dish apart from other beam dishes are the fresh herbs the fresh sage and thyme now first I'm going to add some extra virgin olive oil into my pan and we're going to heat up all the ingredients a couple cloves of garlic and you know Tuskens love beings there's a lot of different beam dishes and this happened through my favorite and again you can use as much garlic as you like you just don't want this dish to be overpowered by the taste of garlic and we're just gonna heat it up you don't want it to turn dark brown or burn because it becomes very bitter so now we need some sage about a tablespoon or so mmm smells good has like a musty minty taste you can use as much or as little sage as you like but I happen to love sage so I'm going to use a lot and sage grows very easily in Italy so that's why we also use a lot of it and we're gonna use about a teaspoon or so of fresh thyme when you're buying herbs you always want to look for vibrant green color of the leaves and the stems and no wilting or browning sometimes beans can be a little bit boring in their flavor so you want to enhance them with lots of fresh herbs and extra virgin olive oil garlic all right perfect so now let's add some of the herbs and again we're not cooking the herbs we're just warming them up the heat brings out all the aroma and the fragrance now for the tomatoes and now I'm using canned tomatoes they just have more juice and they work really well in this traditional bean dish and I can make them all year round because these tomatoes are sweet look at those colors vibrant red with the green from the herbs looks great all right we're gonna cook that for just a couple of minutes and the meantime I'm ready for my beans and i'm using cannellini bean which is a type of Tuscan bean you can definitely use dried beans and Phil come overnight and cook some but just to make my life easier i like to use canned beans I'm off to the sink to rinse the beans it's important to rinse off canned beans just to wash away the flavors of the can and a liquid that it's Gordon while I'm here I'm grabbing my arugula it's almost time to plate up of course the beans are cooked so all I'm doing is just blending all the flavors of the herbs and the tomatoes and flavoring them a little bit salt and some freshly ground black pepper and just reheating them because the warmth of the beans and the herbs and the tomatoes will slowly start to wilt the arugula and that's what makes it so wonderful one more little added flavor some prosciutto and I've got some thinly sliced prosciutto here and I just want to quickly dice it this just adds sort of a salty layer of flavor to the dish and we don't even really have to cook it we're just gonna reheat it really quick it just needs it I really feel that bean dishes are fantastic as long as you flavor them you really flavor them that's ready and we're gonna toss the warm beans with the prosciutto and tomatoes and sage and thyme right over the arugula there we go okay this is gonna go so perfectly with my chicken Florentine oh I cannot wait all right now I'm gonna take a look at that su cocktail cake because it's been sitting in the fridge for three hours and I think it's ready oh my gosh it looks so good and it's gonna look even better once I unmold it and decorate it that's up next
I love this grapefruit salad because it is so clean that claims the palate and nothing does it as well as great freedom I peel the grapefruits just like you would an orange same thing just take a serrated knife and basically peel off the skin until you expose the flesh it smells so good just like that so now I take a grapefruit and I just make little slices you could segment it if you want to but this is a lot easier it actually looks really pretty cuz it ends up looking like a little flower it's really pretty I love it so again just carefully slice it want to slice it about a half an inch or so and then I take the slices I just want to fan them out around the platter there we go and just fan it out do it with this one as well and these pink grapefruits are yummy and juicy look at that here we go take that and just kind of fan it out make it look really pretty and we're gonna add a red onion and then again just little thin slices just like that let's take that and we'll just sprinkle it right over the top so now we need some olives I know of olives they're rich and they're sort of cream Ian and soft so I'm just gonna cut the black olives in half look how pretty that is right against the grapefruit color and some chives just a little chive again a nice little mild onion flavor and a little green freshness too and i love the way tribes look I love to eat salads but you just have to be creative with what you put in them you know you just add the ingredients that you really love and of course gotta finish it off with some fresh basil give it a quick little slice and I just want to have it in like long little slices so I kind of like that see how pretty those are so and that right on top that make a little dressing this is the easiest thing in the world a little bit of balsamic vinegar but a little bit goes a long way with balsamic vinegar extra virgin olive oil remember it's addressing you want the fruitiness of the olive oil again just drizzle it right over the top salt alright salad is done

in Italy alfresco dining is a way of life Italian dishes are perfect for outdoor eating in California what can be more alfresco than having an Italian feast right on the beach today I'm packing up lots of great make-ahead dishes to serve to my friends like my orzo salad of beans onions tomatoes and fresh mint crostini topped with layers of endive mozzarella and prosciutto my grilled chicken gets a touch of Italian with a basil and garlic dressing and for dessert my own take on an American favorite s'mores wait till you see what's melting inside make it a head and keep it simple that's the recipe for great beach party fire up the barbecue grill chicken is a beach party classic you can give it a fresh new taste by marinating the chicken in lemon juice olive oil and fennel seeds then just keep the chicken and the marinade in a sealable plastic bag until it's time to cook grilled chicken with basil dressing makes eating out of gourmet occasion for my beach party I want to get as much done ahead of time as possible then I put everything in plastic baggies and in containers and then bring it over my friends house and finish everything off there that way I don't get stuck in the kitchen for the whole party the first thing I want to do is the marinade for the chicken and at the same time I'm gonna prepare the basil vinaigrette that's gonna go over the chicken after it's cooked so we're gonna take some lemon and the what I'm gonna do first is just zest the lemon it's a lot easier to zest a lemon before you cut it and I just need a little zest to kind of kick up the flavors in the marinade and now cut it in half and I'd like to roll the lemon just to get the juices flowing we're gonna use a couple tablespoons so about 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and some fennel seeds when you use one and a half teaspoons of fennel seeds YUM it'll really flavor the chicken cuz chicken can be kind of bland and boring like we all know always looking for new chicken dishes well this is a really great marinade over the chicken it really flavors the chicken well then we're gonna grill on it's gonna be great a little bit of olive oil about a third of a cup of olive oil let's see here about that much olive oil alright we're ready to add the marinade to the chicken and I'm gonna put the chicken in a double baggie now the reason I double bag it is because I've had this happen in the past I've put the chicken in and the marinade put in the fridge two hours later I go in there and the marinade has spilled all over the refrigerator so this is a really great way to make sure you keep everything clean nothing gets contaminated and all the marinade stays in the bag not in the fridge just pop all these little chicken breasts they're boneless and skinless that way the marinade can really penetrate into the meat and we get them on the grill and they cook really fast perfect those in there and now we'll add the marinade easy as pie they're they're sealed just massage the ticket so that's the marinade coats pinch it as a piece of chicken breast all right leave that aside I'll pop that in the fridge a little later on but for now I want to finish making the basil vinaigrette so we're gonna add the rest of this lemon right in here just squeeze the lemon eat a little muscle sometimes and some basil fresh basil leaves and this will be really pretty when we poured over the chicken just a little basil chopped it just a little bit here so we don't have the blood or do too much work we'll add garlic just one clove keeping it really clean just go ahead peel it and just give it a quick little chop since we chop the basil as well and now let me run it for a minute and then I'm going to add olive oil and let's add now the third of a cup of olive oil and a little salt of course right on top there right I'm just gonna add a little bit of pepper really use it just right on top just like that and now I'm just ready to pour it into my little container so we're just gonna pour it in here pretty that is seal it up and it's ready to go this is done pop the chicken in the fridge and then we'll grill it up later on one dessert that's delicious in any language is s'mores I put an Italian twist on this campfire classic by using slices of sweet crunchy baguette then I top them with an Italian hazelnut chocolate and of course a toasted marshmallow YUM I've sliced the baguette and before I toast it I need to add a little flavor into it so I've got some melted butter and I'm just gonna brush melted butter right on top now I know most of the time you know of course traditionally s'mores are made with graham crackers but my parents used to make s'mores for us they used to make it with baguette what am I going to say they they were not into the whole graham cracker thing they thought you know the marshmallow is already sweet the chocolates sweet and I've been making it this way ever since you know it's one of those things that just stuck now I'm sprinkling each one of these slices with a little bit of granulated sugar and it's unbelievable but it goes in the oven it toasts and then you get this crunchy golden crust on top perfect I'm gonna pop it in the oven 350 degrees for about 15 minutes until make crispy and golden on top and then put them in my Garrett I containers and we're ready to head to the beach and make s'mores

the perfect sweet treat on a hot day is lemon ricotta granita the clean Chris bite of frozen lemon ice is smoothed out by the topping of sweet creamy ricotta cheese the lemon ricotta granita cleanses your palate as it tingles your taste buds the sweet part of this lemon granita is the simple syrup so I want to just simmer a 1 cup of water with three quarters of a cup of sugar and we're just doing this to dissolve the sugar there we go about medium heat and going to take a couple of minutes for the sugar to dissolve and now I want to juice my lemons and usually granita is made with coffee that's a lot of times you see coffee granita and especially in Italy it's made with coffee but in this case I'm using some fresh lemon juice just gonna roll the lemons just to release the juices and it makes it easier to work and juice lemons when they're not cold when that room temperature just there we go and thus it is just helping me catch all the little pips and we need two thirds of a cup of fresh lemon juice there we go and you want to use fresh lemon juice if you want the freshness the clean light flavor of fresh lemon juice now I want to dest from lemon and this is just for the garnish for the top of the grenada but I want to do it now while I still have whole lemons here that should be plenty we'll use that later now we'll just juice this one as well you want to get two thirds of a cup so we still have a few more lemons to go the texture of a granita it's icy and slushy and really refreshing on a hot day okay this is all done the sugar is completely dissolved okay now we're gonna add the lemon juice and we'll whisk just a little bit just to blend it all together and now I'm gonna pour it in this glass baking dish all right so good now I'm gonna cover it with plastic wrap and I'm gonna set it in the freezer for a few hours and I want to scrape it every 45 minutes just until the ice crystals start to form and it gets us fleshy consistency now while that's in the freezer I'm gonna make my topping and I'm gonna use some ricotta cheese as the topping and what I like about it is that it's sort of like cottage cheese it doesn't have as many Kurds but it has that same texture I think it works really well with the granita there we go and of course we need a tablespoon of sugar I'd like to sweeten my topping just like that and a pinch of salt and the reason I'm adding just a pinch of salt it kind of brings out the cheesy flavor in the ricotta and the sweetness and the sugar I'm gonna mix these up and I'm gonna leave it in the refrigerator until them ready to put it on top of the grenada mmm I can smell that from very nectarine crisp let's take a look wow so good it's still bubbling a topping so fantastic nice and brown now I'm gonna let this cool for a bit and then I'm gonna serve up all these desserts to my friends
a good lunch is a go anywhere taste of home for me one of the best ingredients to use is pasta I start with some spiral shape routine then top with juicy roma tomatoes extra virgin olive oil and tangy lemon a crumble of ricotta salata adds a salty bite the Athenian with sauce of the Yamuna is home cooking you can take with you I'm gonna get started another quick easy and delicious lunch with my routine e with South Sylvania morning so first thing I want to do is put some salt in my water got a season the pasta routine ER these spirals they're about one to two inches long just like that they're so cute and this sounds like it's trapped inside which I love they're also known as Fuji depending on what part of Italy you're in yeah give it a quick little stir there we go just like that and they'll take about eight to ten minutes to cook in the meantime I'm gonna make my Ross Southside now south and Italians basically just means sauce and none of this is gonna be cooked so it's super easy you can make it while the pasta cooks I'm just gonna take a little paring knife and just core the tomatoes and then I'm gonna cut them with wise just like that then I'm gonna squeeze out all the seeds so let's just go ahead and core all of these roma tomatoes I'm using a pound of roma tomatoes I love them because I have that concentrated tomato flavor just take them in the palm of your hand and squeeze and see how the seeds come out super easy just like that okay I am just going to dice all of my tomatoes there we go okay now I want to add a little bit of salt the salt is basically gonna immediately bring out the moisture in the tomato so it'll create a little bit of a sauce for the pasta and give it a little kick let some freshly ground black pepper go I'm just gonna give it a quick little stir now it's called sauce of amore right so lemon sauce so I gotta add lemon so I'm gonna zest a whole lemon right on top the lemon zest it has this amazing perfume there we go we're gonna warm the lemon just to release all the juices and go ahead and squeeze the lemon do the whole lemon the lemon juice adds a little bit of moisture to create a sauce and the acidity kind of brightens up the dish I want to check on my pasta it should be al dente by now and let's see these guys mmm nice and salty too I would like it it's basically tender on the outside with a little bit of a bite on the inside I'm just gonna use this handy little scooper and scoop the hot pasta over the tomatoes and the lemon and again the hot pasta will bring out the flavors and the aromas of the fresh tomatoes and the lemon just sort of balance out the acidity and the flavors of the tomato I'm gonna add about 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and it's really important to use really fruity great tasting olive oil in a dish like this because we're not cooking it so all the flavors of the olive oil will be very sort of apparent so if you don't use a good olive oil it could destroy this dish it's smells so good just toss all that together whoo get a nice lemon and tomato facial see how pretty that is okay so now I'm gonna add somebody caught the Salathe now usually I add Parmesan cheese but I'm doing something a little different here so I'm gonna use somebody cost us a Totten it kind of has the flavor of feta cheese but it's a little drier than feta cheese and it's perfect for crumbling and for grading so I'm just gonna kind of cut it into little cubes here because this is a clean and simple dish that he caught the seal out that gives it a little bit of that kick that it needs sort of take that he got the set out to toss it right on top of the rotini just like that give it a nice little mix a little bit in here and you see how the spiral is on the rotini grab all of the sauce it's kind of a hearty pasta with sort of a hearty chunky salsa so when a little bit of the dukakis alotta some tomatoes utakata soffit gives it that meatiness a little bit of that salty bite fresh tomatoes and the fresh flavors from the lemon juice mmm-hmm you could reheat it and have it for dinner the next night or you can eat it cold and there'll be the best pasta salad you've ever had
the Walt Disney Concert Hall is one of LA's most elegant venues and I want my dinner to have that same Flair rigatoni with squash and shrimp is worth a standing ovation the cornmeal and rosemary cake is baking in the oven so while that cooks I'm going to get started on my sauce and I'm making a bit of an unusual sauce because instead of making a sauce out of tomatoes I'm going to make it out of butternut squash so we get a little bit of olive oil into the pan and I'm gonna add one pound of cubed butternut squash I've peeled it and cubed it into about one inch pieces a little bit of salt and some freshly ground black pepper right on top now I want to saute the butternut squash first just because it kind of releases all the sugars and creates a nice caramelized crust on the outside of the bun nut squash and just makes them super sweet and really delicious so let's peel some garlic got a flavor the butternut squash it's gonna chop this garlic make a nice flavor puree out of it a little bit of garlic right on top and I just want to give that a quick little stir when that garlic hits a hot oil or the hot pan the aromas are fantastic talk about an Italian kitchen that smells like an Italian kitchen let that cook just for a couple of minutes just check it's nice and caramelized in the meantime I'm gonna cook my pasta you've got boiling water your really seasoned it so we're gonna add a pound of vega toy just give that quick stir so now I want to add a cup of vegetable stock nice and moist there we go and now for the shrimp while the pasta cooks and the butternut squash continues to cook I'm going to add a little bit of olive oil to my pan and I'm going to season what's gonna make the dish look so elegant and perfect for my special night out some shrimp I'm just going to season it with a little bit of salt and some freshly ground black pepper we're going to add the shrimp to the saute pan and mix those up now the secret with shrimp is you can't cook them for too long they cook in just a couple of minutes two minutes on each side and they're done in the meantime I just want to chop 1/2 a cup of basil lots and lots of basil just want to chop it up and we're gonna add it to the pasta right at the end after we've created the butternut squash sauce let me check side butternut squash they look nice and tender there's still a little bit of sauce left over but it's almost all gone move this over and we'll just add the coupe butternut squash just want to puree it until you get a nice smooth puree take a look now we put it back into the pan and see what a beautiful color that is so we're done with that we go back to the pan I'm just gonna turn my shrimp around and kind of caramelize and create a little crust I've got to thin the sauce out with some milk now sometimes it might take 3/4 of a cup of milk and sometimes it may take a whole cup of milk you just kind of have to see how much liquid you have left over after you cooked and soften the butternut squash it just makes for a nice creamy mixture now we're ready add the pasta it's cooked there we go all the pasta in there and you want that he could fully al dente my shrimp are done so I could take those off the boots it'll switch pan keep those there and I just combine already get Tony with the squash you can see that the sauce goes inside the little tubes it Iike Tony so good so now we're gonna add all the basil right on top and it's just so pretty the colors are fantastic we're also gonna add some Parmesan cheese right on top that's a little saltiness a little butteriness there we go and again give it a quick little mix things off grab your pan yeah there you go look at that cut cream that is okay now just want to top it with the shrimp so you don't want to toss the shrimp inside because the shrimp is what makes this look elegant and special so you definitely want to put the shrimp right on top so everybody can see them how pretty that looks that is my main course it smells so good I just want to dig into it but I'm gonna wait to my friends get here up next I'm going to show you a very simple appetizer that's beautiful using fresh vegetables you know what it takes minutes to make
I'm just grilling two ears of corn I just want to have that nice smoky flavor in my corn and black bean salad and makes it look a lot more festive too and it's such a pretty day outside I wonder how those guys are doing it's a beauty she'll cert now sit down said an hour let's sit down in here so I'm just cutting the corn kernels right off the cob the corns got a nice smoky flavor to it just adds a little pizazz to the whole salad makes it special all right so we're gonna get rid of this you can see the corn kernels are nice and juicy now I'm gonna add a little red pepper some crunch some sweetness and great color that's what I love about red pepper the color and the sweetness and of course some freshness and that crunch so rid of that and you just want to dice it now traditionally and lobster bakes they'll just serve corn on the cob but I'm jazzing it up just a little bit making it extra special and give it a little bit of a California feel okay so red pepper is in and now for a little bit of an island feel and some sweetness I'm gonna add some mango so go ahead and cut the mango now remember there's a big seed in the center of the mango so you can't just cut it down the center you got to cut the sides off kind of like you would with an apple so I just cut all the sides off and it's just easier to do it this way than to have to peel the whole thing I take one slice and I just cut down now don't cut all the way through the skin just kind of cut until you almost hit the skin and it takes a little practice but if you do it a couple times you'll kind of get the feel for it of how deep the knife goes in and then you just open it up just like that so then I take a spoon and I just kind of take them all off just like that and you want to make sure that the mango isn't too ripe just you know nice and tender so get all that off just toss it right in there just like that perfect so now some beans and I have one can of garbanzo beans and one can of black beans and I've already drained and rinsed them and they just add nice creaminess to the salad which will be really good it just gives it more body and gives it more hardiness we'll add a little bit of salt a little bit of black pepper just like that and then add the basil lime vinaigrette that we made earlier a little cumin fresh basil balsamic it's perfect right in there now what I do is leave it in the fridge for a couple of hours just so the basil vinaigrette has a chance to kind of mix in with the corn and the corn and the beans the mango the red pepper everything kind of absorbs that basil lime vinaigrette and it becomes better and better the longer it sits the better it gets so now I've got three sticks of butter when you grab a pan and I'm gonna melt these three sticks of butter you can't have a lobster bake without having some clarified butter to dip the lobster tails in so I'm gonna melt three sticks of butter about one and a half cups of butter and we're gonna do that over low heat I'm also gonna add some lemon tape to make it really really yummy turn the stove on and it'll take a couple of minutes to melt and then I'm gonna show you how to take a traditional lobster bake and give a sort of a West Coast jatta feel to it and the star of course my succulent lobster tails prepared for travel and less mess

clear Gorilla Glue of course for the toughest jobs on planet earth
well when I see luscious plump big blueberries like this I just can't stop myself for making pies blueberry pie is one of my favorites today I'm going to show you how to make individual blueberry pies you'll need about 3 cups of fresh blueberries pick them over you know here's while leaves a few stems just pick them over wash them put them in a big bowl like this and I like to sprinkle them with a little bit of flour about over 3 cups of blueberries which will make about 2 individual pies you're going to need about 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and approximately depending on the sweetness of the berries themselves approximately 1/2 a cup of sugar asked at 1/2 for these because not only are these large and plump they are also very sweet blueberries and I also like to add to the filling a little bit a fresh lemon zest this lemon just perks up the flavor of the blueberries not too much zest but just enough to give a hint of another flavor some people put nutmeg some people put cinnamon mace other flavors in their pies but I just love the taste of blueberries and nothing else now this is 1/2 a recipe at Patras a enough for 2 pies and this is the size pie see how cute these are these actually came from New York cake and baking distributors in New York City at dollar ninety-nine each but they last for many many years I have lots from my catering days so roll this out to quite thin you're going to need 4 circles from this of pastry for the tops and the bottoms and you can see that this is the perfect crust because it rolls out without tearing without crumbling without being tough and I can pick it up very nicely just make sure that your surface is floured enough not too much you don't want to get your pastry tough and now the way I like to do this is just to cut around and fit it right in it's nice to chill the dough if it's gotten a little bit soft or warm you can just put it right down into your refrigerator I love these under the counter drawers and then you're going to need two more circles which will be the top of the pie and kind of about the same size and be very generous with the filling the more the better so mound them up and now add a dab of butter on top of each butter is kind of important in a blueberry pie because it thickens the juices it enriches the juices very nicely oh it's so good and here's our tops I want to have a little air hole in the middle of each of my crust I'm using a biscuit cutter and then just place this over the top press gently with your thumbs then you can bake the pies off not long before your guests are due to arrive so here notice how I'm pressing it down and now there's quite a bit of excess cut around leaving Oh approximately an inch from where you're pressing just from here to here about an inch scissors work very well for this now the reason I'm leaving the overhang is because I want to make what I call bears teeth in Maine in Mount Desert Island there are lots of big rocks lining the edges of cliffs that fall down to the sea and those big rocks are known as bears teeth or Rockefellers teeth mr. Rockefeller had a lot to do with the establishment of Acadia National Park notice I'm snipping all the way around the perimeter nature of the crust so before you bend the teeth up just brush with a little bit of water we're quickly because the pastry tends to get soft and the heat now this should go into the refrigerator if you chilled for about 30 minutes before you bake and we have some already chilling and I'll show you how we finish them off brush the entire crust of the chilled pies with water the sugary crust is very nice especially for a individual pie like this it just makes it nice and crispy and somehow the blueberries can really take another sprinkling of sugar now get these pies right into a preheated 425 degree oven they have to cook until they just start to get golden about 20 minutes then lower the heat to 375 and continue baking until the juices bubble up in the center of each individual pie that's going to take maybe 15 or 20 minutes more and I think we have some very beautiful is almost done right here now aren't those just great and they are bubbling right in the center's very important and let them cool it's very important don't try to eat them this hot they smell really good and you might be very tempted but they have to cool a little bit they will burn you if you try to eat them so hot and aren't those little Bears teeth cute well it's serving with your favorite whipped cream ice cream or just as they are happy July 4th for more entertaining decorating crafts and home keeping tips pick up the latest issue of Martha Stewart Living or subscribe today and Martha Stewart comm slash iTunes offer Martha Stewart on demand free on Comcast Cox optimum and DirecTV to learn more go to Martha Stewart comm John - demand
hi I'm Martha Stewart what if I told you I would come to your home and teach you how to cook from the best of the basics to the secrets of the spectacular I'm about to take your love of cooking to a whole new level frying roasting braising sauteing steaming grilling poaching and enjoying welcome to Martha's cooking school lessons and recipes for the home cook Martha Stewart's cooking school is made possible by welcome everyone to cooking school today's show is all about the sandwich and the bread that makes sandwiches so irresistible some say the sandwich was named after the Earl of Sandwich an eighteenth-century gambler who couldn't break away from the gaming table long enough to eat so his dutiful manservant came up with an easy solution sliced meat between two slices of bread and the sandwich as we know it was born today we're making some all-time favorites a delicious double-decker club layered with roast chicken crisp bacon ripe tomatoes avocado lettuce and mayo next I'll fry some juicy oysters to make an iconic New Orleans specialty the poor boy served with a homemade tartar sauce a legendary olive salad is what transforms the meaty sandwich known as a muffaletta filled with a variety of sliced meats and piquant Peppadew peppers having breakfast on the run is so much better when it has a perfectly fried egg smoky Applewood bacon and melted cheese like my sandwich version does and lastly a classic Reuben made with layers of succulent corned beef Swiss cheese and tangy sauerkraut on fresh rye bread stay tuned the club in club sandwich comes from the fact that they were popular items on clubhouse menus most notably at the Saratoga Club in Saratoga New York where the famous horse races take place what sets this club sandwich apart is a freshly roasted chicken breast and let me show you how I like to do it very easy to do and if you're making club sandwiches you should do a whole breast cut in half or two or three if you have a large family or a large gathering salt and pepper clean beautiful fresh chicken breasts and pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees this makes the tastiest chicken for sandwiches better than poaching actually so just put that right into your 375 degree oven for about 30 to 35 minutes so this is a roasted chicken breast you can take the skin off if you like but I kind of like the skin on my sandwich this chicken roasted like this is also really good shredded for chicken salad so there and we're using a lovely toasted white bread for the sandwich it's actually a brioche slather each piece with homemade mayonnaise if possible or store-bought and another thing people forget to do on sandwiches is to salt and pepper the sandwich so we have the toast you can layer the chicken right on one slice yummy so good-looking and each one of these is a separate layer so you want to build the same sandwich on both so chicken chicken beautiful slice of tomato now some avocado so you can actually slice your avocado right in the shell layer your avocado right on to the tomato the best best ingredients make really really good sandwiches fresh avocado perfectly ripe and here we have our bacon don't forget a little bit of salt and pepper and now top with lettuce this crispy iceberg lettuce will help hold the sandwich together so then this one goes on top of this one now a little bit more Mayo and a sweet and sour gherkin you can use bread and butter pickles dill pickles sweet and sour gherkins but that is a club sandwich that you will remember now once you have it skewered with the toothpicks then with a serrated knife you can actually cut it in half and put this towering kind of Dagwood club right on a sandwich plate served with pickles skewered with toothpicks this is the club sandwich everyone will remember it's an easy way to make an ordinary lunchtime really special and delicious there you have it and now for the po-boy Pio ' Bo white it's a sandwich a New Orleans gastronomic masterpiece and it was created in the 1920s by two grocers who served it free to striking streetcar workers that they called poor boys there are countless fillings from shrimp to catfish softshell crabs sliced meats today I'm piling my po-boy mile-high it with fried oysters frying oysters delicate but good into one cup of buttermilk add a half a teaspoon of pepper freshly ground black pepper and a teaspoon of salt and about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper so that is our liquid the oysters have been shucked now we have 48 Easter's four dozen they are plump they are clean and they are going to just have a bath of buttermilk and you can sort of stir them around a little bit you want to keep the oysters from getting mashed mushed you want nice big plump oysters so there now we have a cup of cornmeal fresh cornmeal and one cup of unbleached flour and just a pinch of cayenne stir this together you can whisk it with a little whisk this is our coating for the oysters it gives a little crunch and rather than have a temporal like batter this is just a nice little crispy coating on the oysters and a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper there mix that up the oil is at 350 degrees this is a canola oil you can use canola you can use safflower and I'm just using my fingers because this way I can be sure that the oysters are going to be well coated and just drop one at a time so use one and for the oyster and one hand for the coating and you can put them around here like that if you wish save a little time but don't pour all of these into the cornmeal they're so pretty they take just about four minutes or so I think that first batch is ready to come out so if you thought that frying Easter was fine from assuming you can see that it really isn't now while they're still warm sprinkle those with a little bit of salt I love this spider because it really does allow you to get the food out of the oil without too much grease after they're done you're going to toast your buns and these are top split buns which are typical for lobster rolls doing very well here so real important to watch the temperature of your oil monitor it so it does not get too cool there okay boys just look great and these are ready for our sandwiches so now toast the rolls these are those top split buns just put them on a griddle pan and toast on both sides and make sure you butter this side and that side and 48 oysters enough oysters for the eight poor boys all right and now the tartar sauce 1/3 of a cup of homemade mayonnaise some cornichon about three tablespoons of cornichon about two tablespoons of capers and you can rinse the capers shallot very important ingredient in a good homemade tartar sauce one shallot finely chopped and the juice of a whole lemon just squeeze that right into your tartar sauce oh there and this is good made yesterday for today so now to assemble these wonderful sandwiches just open the roll put as many oysters as you possibly can now don't you want to sink your teeth into this oh so tasty and top with some tartar sauce soft on the inside crispy on the outside you're going to love this New Orleans favorite pull boys in 1906 senior Lupo Salvador a a New Orleans grocer so that some of his customers struggled juggling their lunch items bread salami cheese and olives ingeniously he came up with a way to combine them all in a sandwich and called it a muffaletta named for the round bread on which it was made now I'm using a write country rule a round country bread and I've cut it in half and I'm going to take out just the center all the Brady bread this you can turn into bread crumbs you can eat it or you can give it to the birds but it gives you lots of room to build this muffaletta sandwich do the same thing with the bottom half comes out very easily and what makes this muffaletta is the wonderful olive salad that we use to flavor the sandwich okay so the bread is ready now the olives get yourself one of these little olive Pitters if you like stick it in here like this and watch the seed comes right out and there is your olive so this is perfect for small oil-cured olives but it will not work for these giant green olives so the easiest way is just to cut the olive off the pit like this now I have the olives already chopped six ounces of green olives finely chopped two ounces of the oil cured olives finely chopped one salt packed anchovy fillet finely chopped also and some fresh herbs we have oregano thyme and parsley so stir this around add a quarter of a cup of olive oil and two tablespoons of a red wine vinegar to some salt and pepper now this has to be made the day before I'll refrigerate it and just that it's sick so all the flavors meld one last flavoring and that's a little bit of hot sauce and don't forget the lemon very important the juice of half a lemon cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight and we have one already made it does change color a little bit so we're ready to start we can start with a little bit of the olive just a little bit in the bottom of the bread and then delicious mortadella and whatever way you really feel like layering this mortadella is this big loaf it's kind of the original Bologna it's a very large smoked sausage and it's studded with cubes of pork fat peppercorns sometimes pistachios and or green olives but here is a beautiful sopressata some vino keyonnah salami fontina cheese you can really make up your own mix but you want to have each layer pretty complete like that so that when you slice this everybody gets some some more of the olive now this is a great great sandwich to make for a long weekend with guests in your house with a big green salad oh and don't forget some arugula another slice of mortadella and every muffaletta is a little different from every other provolone's this is a Coppa and this lovely sopressata this is spicy we have another spicy thing to add and these are those delicious Peppadew these are a little tiny red pepper that's pickled and kind of a sweet hot sauce really huge keep going I could put a little bit more olive on here more arugula and arugula is a bitter green try to get small pungent leaves okay and one more layer here and the last bit of olive so the all is good to top it with because this is going to soak into the top layer of the bread because we've made room for the mound now cover it with this put this in the middle of your plastic wrap and draw the plastic wrap all the way around your bread you're going to encase this in the plastic wrap and you're going to press it underneath a heavy weight and it will be ready pressed for tomorrow's picnic so this is a very heavy cast-iron pot that can just stay on it like that it goes into the refrigerator make sure that you have room in your refrigerator for such a weight if you don't have it for this big a pot you can take a smaller frying pan heavy frying pan and fill it with canned tomatoes or something like that but anything that's really heavy that will weight it down and cause all those delicious flavors to sort of mill together so this is the sandwich I made yesterday kick off the heavy pot it's changed quite a bit in volume it is not as high I can unwrap it it looks good it smells really good so there is our funny funny muffaletta looks like a big flat sandwich and you cut this into wedges for your picnic here's a very sharp red knife curious to see the perfect lairs looks very delicious cut this one into thirds and if you want a smaller piece cut it into eighths what a nice way to serve a large group a make-ahead sandwich what could be better than that move Valletta one of the best sandwiches I've ever had is the bacon and egg and cheese sandwich add a little cheese shop right here in New York City it is delicious fontina cheese fried egg bacon and English muffin so I thought I'd show you how to make my favorite breakfast sandwich grated cheese sliced cheese bacon highest-quality bacon you can find it can't be bacon that's been sitting around cooked for a long time has to be freshly cooked like this English muffin just warm it on the griddle outside first then turn it over and toast the inside and I'm going to find the biggest nicest egg I have to toss up I think this one we're going to fry the egg right into bacon grease the bacon can stay in there and just break your egg right into the same pan is now look good I always sprinkle my fried eggs with a little bit of salt and pepper and I don't turn them over so now our English muffin is nicely toasted put on some fontina cheese don't break the yolk if you break the yolk fry another egg if you like you can just take a little bit of the bacon grease and pour it over the yolk that helps feel their bacon looks done so now on top of the egg put a little bit of grated fontina right on top melts into the egg and this is getting nice and soft a little bit of pepper put your bacon right on top looking good and our egg is done this goes on top of the bacon I think I better build this right on my plate and this muffin goes right on top now that's my favorite egg sandwich and I think it's the perfect way to start your day a Reuben sandwich warm juicy layers of corned beef melted Swiss cheese sauerkraut and russian dressing sandwich between toasted rye bread that's what a Reuben is all about I'm buttering the outside of two nice slices of seeded ride and this sandwich was thought to have been created by a New York delicatessen owner Arthur Reuben who reportedly made it with ham for Charlie Chaplin's leading lady in a film shot in the early 1900s how's that for a bit of trivia well here now it puts a buttered side down and start layering this is thinly sliced corned beef and you need about per sandwich three ounces because the best delis don't skimp so we're going to be the best Deli making this Reuben sandwich fold it over try to make the meat as even thickness as possible YUM and then we have lovely Swiss cheese and another layer and remember seeing the Russian dressing so I think homemade russian dressing is the best 1/3 of a cup of mayo some sweet pickle relish just about 2 tablespoons some ketchup again about two tablespoons stir this together and as you can just keep in a little jar in the refrigerator for your liverwurst sandwiches your corned beef sandwiches your Reuben sandwiches a nice sprinkling of black pepper about it half a teaspoon of salt and secret ingredient Worcestershire sauce just about a teaspoon Oh yummy that is a very nice russian dressing so oh you could also put a little bit of lemon juice in here I think that would be a good idea if your lemon has one of those little bobbins on it you can cut that off it squeezes better just about a teaspoon of lemon juice that is good russian dressing so now sauerkraut about 1/2 a cup of nice German sauerkraut which is basically fermented pickled cabbage and put a lot of russian dressing right here on the unbuttered side of the bread the buttered side is going to be cooked and that's what helps toast the Rye bread so a nice slathering of russian dressing and put that right over very nice and get this into a slightly warm pan and let it toast both sides and so now when you think it's nice and brown flip it and that looks really good just about done that cheese is nice and soft the bread is nice and toasted remove it to a board because I think you're going to want to cut this in half so pretty oh wow this is a great looking sandwich and warning this sandwich is so juicy and so delicious that you might need a few extra napkins eat this up while it's still hot and toasty I think you'll really enjoy all the sandwiches I showed you they do make a meal thanks so much for

[music playing] I'm going to preheat my oven to 400, because I'm going to do my asparagus bundles in there. Although you could do this whole meal on your outdoor grill no problem. I'm going to use my slotted broiler pan that I never use for anything. It's perfect for this. I'm going to grab a couple of bundles of asparagus. I've got 1 pound and 1/2. And some bacon, some applewood bacon. And I've got a little bit of fresh thyme. That's going to be for my burgers later. I'm going to grab some shallots, too. I know I'm going to need those for my burgers. I'm so excited about this meal, I just don't know where to begin. OK. Well, I guess I'll begin with the asparagus bundles. I was trying to think of what to do with the burger that didn't involve a lot of starch, because everybody's eating, you know, the Atkins, and the low carb, and the no carb, all that kind of thing. So one of the good things about many of those diets is that you get to eat a lot of bacon. I think everything in reason. Don't go nuts with a pound of bacon. But a little bit adds a lot of flavor, and it's great on the grill. So I'm going to wrap my asparagus in the bacon. And I need to know where to take the tip of the asparagus, where it's going to be nice and tender. So I just hold it on both ends and give it a little snap. I'll show you a couple here. And then you just use that as a guideline. Now you could save this part for soup. No problem there. It's a good idea. Asparagus makes a lovely, simple soup. Especially with all those great store bought stocks you can use out there. Soup is just so quick and easy to make any night. I rinsed these off when I brought them home from the store. That's always a big time saver, right? Now let's just give them a snap. Cool. Now if you can only find really big stalks of asparagus that day, no problem. Just take a vegetable peeler to the ends and trim them down a little and they'll be perfect. And here you're just trying to pick up a method. This is just an idea for the method. You can wrap bundles of waxed beans, green beans, strips of zucchini, green onions. You can mix and match all those vegetables. But you want about this size. About 4 inches to work with here. I'm going to drizzle these with a little EVOO, extra virgin olive oil. It's good to go. A little salt and pepper. And why dirt a bowl? Just work right on the pan. And I'm going to get a quick count here. There's 5, 10, 15, 20. Yeah. I think I've got about 35, 40 spears here. So I'm going to divide by 4 roughly, and just grab handfuls. That looks about right-- of about 8 to 10 pieces. Well, it would be good if I opened my bacon first. Hello. Now, I like a nice center cut bacon or an applewood smoked bacon, because they come so nice and lean now. Look at that. It's gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful bacon. Slab bacon is fine. Turkey bacon is fine if you don't do pork. How simple is this. And any time I see something all wrapped in bacon like this, it just looks so formal and pretty, doesn't it? And there's nothing going on. Look how simple that is. And you could do smaller versions of this. Little half pieces of bacon and just a couple pieces of asparagus. It'd be perfect for a little party snack. And you know, you're going to find that if you do go ahead and roast the asparagus, or even if you grill it outside with the lid down, it's going to get this nice almost nutty flavor to it. It's a totally different experience from steamed asparagus. That's one of the neat things about cooking. You play around with the methods as much as you do with the seasonings, and you'll find a whole new taste experiences. Look how great that worked out. Oh, I just love it when a plan comes together like that. OK, let's get these guys in the oven. They'll go about 12 minutes or until the bacon gets nice and crisp. And of course, the fat will go right down through the slotted pan and drip away. Oh, I can't wait to eat those. That's so up my alley. A little squirt of soap. There we go. OK, let's get these little guys into the oven. They don't need a lot of muss and fuss. That's another great thing about this meal. It kind of takes care of itself, it babysits itself.
lemon ricotta cookies with lemon glaze will put a smile on the face of anyone you send them to so I'm going to start with the dry ingredients we're going to use two and a half cups of flour so now I'm going to add some baking powder one teaspoon so the flour kind of gives the cookies their structure and the baking powder lets them rise just ever so slightly we're also going to add a teaspoon of salt I'm going to start with my wet ingredients I'm going to use one stick of unsalted room-temperature butter so we're going to use two cups of sugar so I'm going to cream the butter and the sugar together perfect now I want to add the eggs we're going to add two eggs one at a time and I'm going to add lemon zest the only one use the yellow part you don't want to use the white part which is kind of bitter and that's called the pith okay so now I want to roll the lemon just to release all of the juices we're going to use about three tablespoons we're gonna give it another mix buddy-cop the cheese that's why they're known as lemon ricotta cookies we're going to use one 15 ounce container of regular ricotta cheese now I'm done with that and I'm ready to add my dry ingredients I'm just going to add a little bit at a time basically like thirds I'm just gonna take a small ice cream scoop and you want to leave about an inch or so between the cookies so that way when they bake they can spread apart and not touch each other my lemon ricotta cookies are cooling so now it's time to make the lemon glaze so I'm going to use one and a half cups of powdered sugar and again you just want to level off the top now to flavor it I'm going to add some lemon zest so I added lemon zest inside the cookies and I'm going to add it on top of it too and we're gonna use again about three tablespoons of lemon juice there we go take your spatula mix it all together and basically the powdered sugar will absorb all the lemon juice and create some nice glaze I love these cookies with the glaze on top okay so it's slowly coming together and you see the little bits of the lemon see how pretty that is see how thick it is - I just love it so now grab the cookies that have cooled and I put them on this rack that way I don't have to worry if any of the glaze sort of seeps off the sides of the cookies so just want to put a little bit of glaze on each cookie you want to let them sit for about two hours that way the glaze becomes nice and hard and you can pack them up
lemon was one of my favorite desserts unfortunately one of Frank's two so I'm gonna make Frank and Steven and now I'm gonna make the base of the lemon mousse so first I'm gonna use three whole eggs and then I'm gonna separate three eggs and put the yolks in the base and with the egg whites to make it nice and light and fluffy okay next I need a cup of sugar and lots of lemon zest 2 teaspoons 1/2 a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice just gonna whisk it all together a little salt mmm I'm gonna flip this over double boiler and just cook it until it thickens so the first thing I need is half of the egg whites 2 tablespoons of sugar just sweeten it a little bit pinch of salt and just whip those on high I'm gonna get the cream and I'm gonna get the base for my lemon mousse just done so I'm just gonna take this plastic wrap off the base so you make a really thick custard and then you lighten it by folding in egg whites and whipped cream and that's how you make a mousse this is the thing about folding you just want to put it on top and then fold it in slowly want to do nothing that will deflate the egg whites put the spatula down in the middle and then just fold it over really carefully can really smell the lemon zest in this so now I'm gonna whip some cream make it even lighter hard to imagine cream is life okay one cup of cream and you can just do it in the same bowl so I put the cream I'm just gonna pour it on top and fold it in this is so many layers of things but the good news is you can make it in advance and let it sit in the refrigerator for a long time just want to fold it in really carefully just like the egg whites make sure you don't deflate them okay and then I'm gonna give an extra special flavor I'm gonna put in half a cup of lemon curd gives it a real lemon bite it's about half a jar and then fold that in again carefully but not too much but this is really good mmm so good so lemonade the millet has disaster the lemon curd and yet it's really still very light so you can really do a lemon mousse just like this but I'm gonna make it ex-special and decorate with cream and lemon slices

[Music] now we're going to make this this jerk marinate it could be a jerk marinade it can be a jerk rub sometimes it's dry sometimes it's wet this is kind of the guy's big bite version I throw in a couple little secrets okay first things some onion some Wow it's a bunch of ginger some ginger a little jalapeno I need this I need that I need that okay let me get this out of the way the microplane gonna zest a little bit of lime in here okay not a lot of seeds in there fresh orange juice is just perfect okay a little bit more put about but don't want to put the orange peel on this one that's that's not what we're looking for okay down let's get some jalapeno now I'm gonna put actually Believe It or Not seeds and the whole thing not the stem but the ribs and everything in there I'm looking for some of that big heat okay that goes in a little onion go red onions really nice in this okay but you know what you got to kind of put everything in there that you know a similar size so something doesn't get cut up or or processed down farther than the other you know okay dice on that there we go really great big flavor people sometimes a little bit scared of it because it is spicy but there's different you know there's different degrees of it depending on what you're putting into it and how far you're taking it like I said you can do it as a dry rub if you want this is kind of like a wet marinade it's going to sit on here for about eight hours so that's in some garlic clove look at I just put everybody in the pool here a little green onion get these bad boys down now here's one of the real big pieces to this and that is a little bit of thyme there you go this follows in that real traditional idea of doing the jerk not being the jerk doing the jerk okay get a few of those in there try to keep the stem detter these don't break down real well okay and I always like a little soy sauce I think that it's you know kind of follows along in the in bringing some salt into it but its own style of salt so just a little bit of that down some fresh cracked pepper now you can make this ahead of time hold it in the fridge a matter of fact as the flavors kind of hang out with one another for a while I think it actually improves there you go a little bit of salt here's the kicker the allspice actually a berry kind of has a flavor of cinnamon nutmeg and clove but it's actually a little berry now this is the ground-up version but it'll work real nice in here and just a touch it's kind of like that Chinese five-spice powder you don't want to put too much in there you'll really know it's in there okay hold on keep your hands inside the ride and then I'm gonna go ahead and get this marinade in here look at that all you should smell it get all that jalapeno right at the beginning there we go okay nice and thick now you could even take this farther and you could use this a little bit later but if you're going to put it on the chicken right now it's pretty much just going to work as a marinating can't be incorporated into a sauce so check this out now this can marinate up to like eight hours especially when you've got the skin and the bone on it see I'm gonna go skin side down first there we go there we are Caribbean jerk chicken first we whip up a tangy marinade of OJ olive oil lime juice allspice onion ginger jalapeno and time then we'll grill each side of the bird and then throw it in the oven what comes out is one funky chicken

you know you don't always need a barbecue to make barbecue sometimes an oven is just as good as any macdaddy grill that you have outside and I've got an old-fashioned barbecue plate with your name on it my ultimate barbecue ribs start with a meaty slab of baby back ribs we're gonna cook in the oven until they fall off the bone so we've got two racks a baby back ribs all right we're gonna season these guys up with some salt and pepper we're gonna drop these into the oven I get some fresh cracked pepper the flavor is gonna taste fantastic and it's gonna have a beautiful color all at the same time and then halfway through the process we're gonna start to baste it with a sauce all right into the oven low and slow 250 degrees for probably two hours Jeffy's goes in cool so the slab is in now I was talking about making some homemade barbecue sauce all right so what we have here is a pot now there's something about you know buying the stuff in a jar but there's also something about making it yourself and it doesn't take that much time it's just basically like putting a couple of ingredients into a pot and this kind of lets simmering away so we're gonna do start off with some smoked bacon now the smoked bacon is actually we're gonna get a lot of our smoky flavor from because we're not using wood chips we're not using charcoal so we're gonna pull a lot of flavor out from the bacon itself and what we're gonna do is we make a little bundle with a fresh thyme and we're gonna wrap this up pretty tight it just add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil to the bottom of our pot here and then we're gonna start to sear this and really extract some delicious flavor out the whole thing it's gonna go in just like that chop it away so we let that start to render okay then we're gonna do and just take an onion I've got a garlic head here I'm gonna use half an onion and I'm so to cut this guy right in half and pull the paper off and we're gonna throw this straight to the bottom of the pot and we're gonna leave us into a big piece we're gonna straighten all this out later we're just making the sauce and we let this start to simmer away okay they're all smooth do the same thing with a garlic we're talking about a couple pieces here and I've got two cloves maybe three we're gonna smash the paper off and throw them in as large big chunky bits okay take the paper off and I'm gonna throw them right into the pot if you definitely want a lot of garlic because it's gonna taste delicious with a pork and it's really gonna make the sauce nice and bold it's gonna let everything start to do its thing right so we've got some great base flavor here now what we're gonna do is add some Basin sauce we got some ketchup some peach preserves they've also got some spicy Dijon mustard we're gonna take probably two cups of ketchup and this is gonna be the base for the whole thing and it's also gonna give the barbecue so it's a lot of discuss it is to make it nice and thick okay drop that in all right then we're going to take our peach preserves peach and barbecue tastes really really good together and then great now we're gonna start to balance out our flavor it with a Dijon so it's nice and spicy if you don't have the Jean you certainly use mustard powder but I think the the spice really kind of comes out with Dijon mustard okay so we got that now let's talk about some spices we got some other things here okay we've got some paprika I love a little bit of cumin behind which I think it's gonna be really delicious all right we also got some molasses some red wine vinegar and some brown sugar so you got about a quarter cup of molasses okay we got the same thing with brown sugar okay take a whole fresh box of stuff the brown sugar is really delicious so Brown sugars gonna go in break a big chunk looks pretty good and then we're gonna add a little splash of red wine vinegar just to give it a nice fresh balance about two tablespoons to do the trick all right then we add a little bit spice to it I've got the the paprika which is a little smoky they were also going to add the cumin to that humans are really delicious for the southwestern spice which I think it's gonna balance out everything else as well so it's very distinctive bold you know alright a little bit of cumin I've got some salt all right we got some fresh cracked pepper I'm telling you that smells delicious already I'm gonna stir this together and then kind of let the whole sauce just do its thing right 20 minutes later we're gonna have the best barbecue sauce you ever tasted it is absolutely delicious and that's it now we have two slabs of baby back ribs have been cooking low and slow they smell really delicious and we're basing them with a homemade peach barbecue sauce which smells fantastic and they are they're about to fall off the bone at this point we're gonna go in for one last dab we're gonna mop on the sauce and then we're gonna throw them back into the oven smelled absolutely delicious by the way they're gonna go into the oven under the broiler just to get a nice crunch on top and they gonna look really beautiful
[Music] first up it's my mango tango chicken chipotle garlic and cilantro season up a mango puree that does double duty as a marinade and as a sauce for killer barbecue chicken the mango is bringing the sweetness now the enzyme inside of the mango is also going to help tenderize the chicken okay that in we get a little bit of garlic get a touch of salt a little fresh cracked black pepper rice wine vinegar fermented rice is how we make the rice wine vinegar there's all different types of it this is the unseasoned we'll touch that got to have vinegar and barbecue sauce I believe okay a little touch of that a little bit a little more vinegar with some some lemon there we go little lemon juice a little bit of oil and here it is the star of the show one of my favorites see a lot on Big Bite sapote lay pepper smoked jalapeno pepper reconstituted in what's called adobo kind of a spicy tomato vinegar sauce and that's really gonna kind of bring through a lot of this what we would think is you know the barbecue flavor the barbecue sauce flavor because of the tomato so one of those nobody's looking just one Tony okay a little bit more and I'm gonna grab some of that adobo sauce in there too want to spice this up a bit and I've got some cilantro you can use the whole thing and in this barbecue sauce I'm going to I'll give it a little pre tear here just to get it going we're gonna use every bit of it okay there we go pulse it a little bit so it bounces down into the blade okay excellent take a look at the chicken now anytime I can get some free range I'll go for it you know I'm starting to get into more organics you know we see we saw organic chicken out there but we're looking for the best chicken we can get but look at those legs I mean nice great looking skin great color we'll load these up in the bag we got some thighs going down too we like to marinate this up to six hours if we can okay pop that off get the danger blade out of the way pop a little bit into there that's enough all right grab this over here now the rest of this marinade or barbecue sauce I'm gonna throw into this a little saucepan heat this up and I'll base the chicken with it when we throw it on the grill okay just last little touch of some this Chipotle barbecue sauce it's you know sweet with some delicious mango and look at those bad boys huh lined up with some legs and thighs sometimes the pieces people aren't so excited about I'm gonna tell you these have cooked down in such a way it's gonna be nice and tender and just fall right off the bone I'm thinking leg thigh leg thigh I think that one's got my name on it nice and hot this is writer okay this is too hot to hold right now but I got to get a piece of that chicken off there look at that moist juicy tender and that sauce on top of that a little bit heat from the chipotle dig
one of the things you see sort of an old school grilling or barbecue is kebabs you know the thing I don't like about kebabs is usually it has more than one thing on and they all cook at different time in a different rates I just like to make skewers of one particular thing at a time one of my favorite things actually put on a skewer it's chicken thighs they have a lot of really terrific flavor I actually like them better than chicken breasts but don't tell anybody the chicken thighs is really the way to go all right first things first let's talk about the skewers if you're going to use wooden skewers you have to waterlog them this way it will keep them from sort of burning away actually want to soak them for at least three or four hours you can soak them overnight it works totally fine I'm going to make a very quick marinade for these skewers I'm going to start with some citrus juices first just some orange juice and a little bit of lime juice and some chili powder I'm using some ancho chili powder and some Chipotle and I think I'm going to put a little bit of garlic in there too I'm gonna add a little bit of salt and pepper okay next sort of the detection that you're looking for a little bit thinner than the paste a little bit thicker than the sauce okay now I use two skewers for each chicken thigh and I go on both sides of the chicken the reason why I'll just put one and throw it on the grill is because then it actually kind of plumps up like a hot dog and I want to keep them nice and flat so they cook very evenly and then what we can do is after we cook them we can actually cut them straight down there you'll have two skewers all right so we're going to take our marinade we're just going to paint this right on here if you want to marinate this a few hours ahead of time or even overnight that will work totally fine and now we can go to the grill if you take a look at my grill I've actually created three different zones here I have one with a lot of charcoal so is going to be the hottest part of the grill then I have some with just a few pieces of charcoal there so it's going to be a sort of like medium heat and then I have a portion of the grill that has almost none and that's going to be a place where I can sort of finish the the chicken thighs and let them cook through without getting too charred that's what you want to hear that nice sizzle and it smells good right away and these cooks for about four to five minutes on each side all right now at this point we just want to let the grill do its job okay the best grillers stay away from the grill as much as possible and just let it happen all by itself in this case we're actually going to flip these just one time don't forget the chicken thighs are actually going to take a little bit longer than chicken breasts because they're a little bit more moist they have to cook through your juicier but the results are way worth it I'm actually going to put a couple of limes on here we're actually going to grill them because we're grilling we're addicted to barbecue so we're going to grill everything we can and I'm going to just take a couple of scallions just to give a little more flavor and just for you know good to garnish the plate now how do you know when they're done that's that's the question I get all the time well in this case you want to make sure that you use a completely firm obviously we're not cooking chicken anything but all the way through I feel like they're cooked almost completely through it was another minute so I'm going to do is actually cover our grill and I think once the limes are grilled the chicken will be done who's got the top down chicken on a skewer that's simple a little bit of flavor on there a few ingredients throw them on the grill and your guests gonna be happy and this isn't even the main course delicious
Have you ever heard of cauliflower pizza crust? Being a food blogger, I see it all the time. I've never actually made one. So I'm going to whip one up now. And I can't wait for the results. I've got a half a head of cauliflower and I just cut it into chunks. I'll throw it into the food processor. And I'm going to let the food processor grind it up. I'm going to pulse it until it's really fine. My food blogging friend told me to keep going until it looks like snow. And I think I'm about there. Yeah. Looks like snow all right. Take the blade out. And I'll get this into a bowl. I'll cover this with some plastic wrap, too. I've got a fork and I'll just poke a couple times. Now, this goes into the microwave. I'm going to draw out the moisture and soften it a bit. That's going to take about four minutes. And from what I understand, the secret to cauliflower crust is getting all of the moisture out of the cauliflower. So I'll take the plastic wrap off. And I have a thin towel here. And I'll dump the cauliflower right on there. And I'll let it cool for a couple minutes until I can ring out all the moisture. Now, I'm going to fold this up. Get it nice and tight in there. And I'll ring all this moisture right into the same bowl that I cooked it in. Gosh, I cannot believe how much water is in the cauliflower naturally. I got all of the moisture squeezed out of the cauliflower. So I'm breaking it up a bit. And I've got a few more things to add to the crust. I'll crack in an egg. Some mozzarella. I'll save the rest of this to go on top of the pizza. I'll also add in some grated Parmesan and Italian seasoning. Just keeping it simple. A little salt and pepper, of course. Now, I'll stir this all together and see what it looks like. I've got some parchment paper on here so the crust won't stick to the pan. I'll start by getting it into a ball. Gosh, it's so easy to work with. Now, I'll press it into a crust. One secret I've heard about cauliflower pizza crust is you want to bake it super thin. Now, I'll get this into a 425-degree oven for about 15 minutes. It smells so good. And it looks amazing. I think I could just break off a piece and eat that right now. I'll put the sauce on the crust. Again, I don't want to add too much moisture, so I'll just put a thin layer. I think that should be enough. That looks like a good amount. The rest of the mozzarella goes on. Gosh, I cannot imagine how good this pizza is going to be. I'm going to put this back into the oven until the cheese is melted. That crust got even more deep golden. I can't wait to try this. I'm going to grab some basil. Not going to slice it up. Just going to grab big leaves. And I'll tear big pieces right onto the pizza. Gosh, what a pretty pizza.
[Music] being from upstate New York corn season is one of the things that we look forward to all summer we have a saying upstate me high by the fourth of July that's what the corn plants do shucking corn takes me right back to being a kid this was always my job to take the paper grocery bag out on the back porch and just shuck the corn so I've spent a lot of time doing this in my life so when we're looking at corn we always look for nice healthy ears with nice and tight corn kernels doesn't that just look pretty I'm so excited to get cooking pull off all this little silky stuff yeah we don't need to floss and eat usually wreaths we boil corn we throw it in a pot of water with some sugar and some milk and that helps bring out the sweetness but there are so many things we can do with corn and one of my favorite ways is to toss these guys on the grill I love that chari black goodness so let's give these a little oil up and some salt of course make things taste really delicious yeah and we just shoot these guys right on there could not be more cinch you know while you're making your your barbecued chicken or steaks or something shoot some corn right on the grill look at us multitasking all right very nice when my corn is done what I like to do with these guys look at that beautiful chard I see my kernels all nice and tender and delicious we're gonna go right back onto that plate we're gonna give it a little squeeze of lime this is something I learned visiting Mexico it's a really bright freshness you're like whoo now we're gonna roll it in some cheese you know what we can be cheesy and corny altogether that yeah roll it around there we really pack that cheese on there ah delicious this is a great side dish or you know what sometimes I like that just by itself that's a nice lunch to me give it a little spicy stuff a little cayenne pepper now for a little bit of kick look it doesn't that look delicious another way I love to eat corn is with pasta I'm a pasta fan I try to eat pasta as often as I can so pasta into my really beautifully salted water I've got some cherry tomatoes that I have got going here sauteed with a little bit of chicken stock and let's add a little bit of crushed red pepper just for a little pika a little kick and of course why salt that makes everything taste good all right I've got my cherry tomatoes going I've got my pasta cooking what am I missing some corn kernels so let's just take my shuck tear of corn I'm gonna cut these guys right off the cob and toss them in at sort of the last minute with my cherry tomatoes so my corn cooks ever so gently but it still has that lovely nice pop when I eat it very nice that a toss around now it's interesting Italians probably wouldn't ever eat pasta and corn together but to me this is the Italian spirit it's the Italian mentality it's seasonal it's fresh it's local yes look at that it looks beautiful it looks delicious so let's just toss some basil in there it is just gorgeous all the colors yes ah smells so good my corn looks beautiful and the tomatoes have let off their juices so it kind of makes like a little sauce stuff going on right in there altogether yeah let's get all that goodness in there see all that corn I'm gonna finish up this beautiful pasta dish with a little bit more grated cheese oh yeah baby all right let's taste this guy whatever way I do it on the grill on the cob in my pasta corn rock
[Music] today I'm making a variety of stuffed vegetables I'm starting by making a filling out of some chopped onions a little bit of olive oil and some salt I want to sweat these onions out that'll bring out the juices and then I'm gonna add in some of the chopped vegetables left over from the cuts that I'm gonna make I've got some crimini mushrooms now I'm just using a handful here so they're not gonna be expensive but I'm gonna get a lot of flavor already a little bit of garlic I've got three cloves of garlic into the food processor and I'm gonna mix this whole a bit of vegetables up with some bulgur and then stuff these vegetables cut out two stuffed peppers there we go just lift that out and try to get the whole hunk of seeds at once it's just a little bit easier and pull out the membrane okay so stuff pepper cut easy enough but don't throw away this little lid go ahead and cut that up rough chop and we'll stick this into the food processor as well did you know you can also make cups out of your zucchini and other summer squash just cut off the ends just cut off between 1/3 and 1/2 the zucchini lengthwise and then we're gonna use the smaller piece just with a rough chop to go into the filling and this bigger piece here I'm just gonna take a spoon just go right along the seeds they should be fairly easy to remove because it is a Keaney it's a young squash so it's not all that firm just scoop it all out you're making a boat where I'm gonna put in the filling alright just take that spoon and there you go let me go ahead who wants some chunks in here but this is all gonna get mixed up with my bulgur and then go into the vegetables that go into the oven in a little bit anyway so there we go a little more salt and yes you can make cups out of tomatoes to just take off the top and again just the spoon just go right around and take out that big hunk of core and seeds okay I've got my vegetables mixed up in here I'm gonna add in my bulgur wheat now this is just a cup of bulgur wheat that I've added two and a half cups of liquid in two and let it sit for about 20 minutes just to heat it up half stock and half water and that was it a little bit of salt and pepper on these vegetables and this is the only chance we're gonna get to season my vegetables so I want to go ahead and make sure I do it let's get this stuffing over here just take your cups stuff them loosely I don't want to pack it in these are gonna go in the oven for about 45 minutes at 350 I'm gonna drizzle the vegetables with just a little bit of olive oil that's gonna make them moist and flavorful cover them with some oil I want to cover them pretty tightly with the foil because I want to make sure that they stay nice and moist these are going to cook for about 45 minutes at 350 and then I'm gonna uncover the vegetables and top them with a little bit of Parmesan cheese [Music]
[Music] tequila lime chicken it's like Geoffrey's favorite Friday night roast chicken but with the volume turned up what I'm doing is I'm going to make a marinade for the boneless chicken breast and it's going to make them taste so fabulous so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of tequila always helps and the next is freshly squeezed lime it's really important none of that bottled stuff you really do need freshly squeezed lime juice it makes all the difference in the world so one cup of freshly squeezed lime juice that actually also tenderizes the chicken 1/2 a cup of orange juice to give it a little sweetness chili powder to give it heat 1 tablespoon if you want more heat you can use more chili powder that's also good tablespoon of chopped garlic give it spice and this is the key ingredient jalapeno pepper it's really hot and I'll show you how this works so slice right in the middle and what's really hot is the seeds so I'm just going to take the seeds out and while you're working on this pepper be sure that you don't touch anything you really care about before you wash your hands because it's incredibly hot don't rub your eye what I'm going to do is just chop this finely I like the tequila lime chicken to have a little bit of heat but I don't want to have third-degree burns when we're done so that goes right in it'll be so good two teaspoons of salt teaspoon of ground black pepper and then the lesson is chicken so I've got six boneless chicken breasts I actually like them with the skin on it think they stay moister so I asked the butcher to take the bone off but leave the skin on and I'm just going to put them in the marinade the great thing about this is not only is it good to leave it overnight but it's actually the more it sits in the marinade the better it tastes so it's a wonderful thing to do for entertaining so that's tequila lime chicken it's gonna be so good on the grill [Music]
[Music] today I'm making turkey noodle casserole to my bacon you don't want it to be fully brown guys you just want it to start rendering the fat just like this to the bacon now I'm going to slide the bacon off to the side a bit I'm gonna now get my turkey breasts in the pan so this is nice and lean and delicious and you could even make this with leftover roast turkey of course or even six slices of deli turkey it's a paper out of there start breaking that up with the paddle here you want to use a wooden utensil if you've got a big nonstick skillet like this of course you could be kind of rough with it start working it up now I'm gonna go ahead and spice it up with a little bit of salt and pepper and poultry seasoning because this was an ode to a leftover Thanksgiving dinner and because I always have plenty of poultry seasoning left over after Thanksgiving that will put a palm full of at it but if you don't have poultry seasoning on hand guys you can use some ground thyme or thyme leaves or sage or a combination of the two but those are your predominant flavors in your poultry seasoning see now the onions are working over here while the turkeys working over there and then to the onions we're gonna add tons of mushrooms now I chose just a white mushroom for this but if you have some shiitakes or some cremini little baby portobellos on hand please feel free to use those any kind you like I was going with kind of a classic feel here and you know back in the day when I was a kid we couldn't get those fancy mushrooms in the regular store like we can today so I went with the white ones now of course you just want to wipe off the top with your damp cloth you don't want to run them under water they get tough on you and rubbery then again thinly slice it chop it whatever you like and just drop it right into the pan on the half with the onions in it I can mix all of those veggies and Turkey all together now and whatever little bits are on the bottom of the pan I'm gonna pick up now with about a half a cup once around the pan of a good quality dry white wine I decided to lighten this up just a bit so I'm gonna use a combination of chicken stock and cream I'm gonna put in about a cup of chicken stock you've got 2 cups of liquid total half a cup of wine 1 cup of chicken stock and about a half a cup of cream I've got some nice whole nutmeg here I'm just gonna grate a little bit over the sauce I use my microplane for this or you could use any small side of your box grater that's fine too you want the equivalent of about a quarter of a teaspoon of it that's all bubbly and delicious and I've got my wide egg noodles here about a half a pound of them all cooked up I'm gonna drain them I don't like to cook them more than three or four minutes you want to drain them when there's still a little bit firm because they're gonna soak up all that delicious juice in our sauce now I'm gonna put these into the colander and then put them right back in the hot pot to get all the water off the noodles before they go into our sauce we don't want it thinning out our sauce give it a good shake sometimes I give it a really good shake at home half of them fall out so be careful not to do that pop them right back into that hot pot and then I'm gonna mix the whole thing together in this nice big pot here I'm gonna add the entire skillet of the turkey mixture and sauce do it nice and careful guys don't make one big dump or you could spatter yourself and that might hurt stir that all together look how good that looks huh insane and because it's all done on the stove top all we're really gonna transfer it to the oven for is melting all the grated cheese that we've got here now I use some Gruyere cheese and you find that in this specialty cheese case but you could use any hunk of good-quality Swiss cheese or you could use a Gouda you just want to slow melting cheese oh you know what I'm gonna get breadcrumbs I like a nice crunchy topping on mine I'm gonna need some vinegar for this Alex you like a little bit of punch in that topping so the bread crumbs they'll take up the oils of the cheese as the oils cook out and give you an extra crunchy top we used to fight over that when I was a kid that was one of the great things about the casseroles was the nice crunchy topping I just melted the Gruyere cheese underneath the broiler on my turkey noodle casserole now let's remember back in the day this would have been made with canned soup mix cream of mushroom soup mix leftover meats or canned tuna we've replaced all that our sauce is made with white wine and stock and a little bit of cream and nuts make it stop to that fabulous Gruyere cheese remember a great meal even an updated retro classic it's never more than thirty minutes away
so I'm making strawberry oatmeal bars for the kids to eat tomorrow it's one of their very favorite desserts I've got a cup and a half of all-purpose flour and a cup and a half of quick oats I cannot believe how quiet the house is I love cooking and baking when the house is quiet like this it's a real luxury for me and then I'm also gonna add a good cup of brown sugar packed brown sugar I want to get as much in there as I can and then I also add a teaspoon of baking powder and about a half a teaspoon of salt and then I'm gonna stir this together a little bit and then I have two sticks of butter that I've cut into pieces I'm gonna throw it in and you can use your fingers and work it in or you can use a pastry cutter which I prefer just kind of work it around it's gonna take a while you basically just need to work it in until the butter is completely incorporated with all the dry ingredients all right this is all nice and work together now I'm just gonna press top of this mixture into this buttered pan this is a really easy recipe and then just use my fingers to press the mixture all the way into a single layer and get it over to the corners okay got a battle all pressed in there and now for the strawberry part I'm using strawberry jam but you can use apricot jam pretty much any kind of jam you have in your fridge I'm just gonna pour this into a single layer you'll need about 10 to 12 ounces of jam which is about how much I had left pretty lucky and then I'll just spread this over the first layer you know what I just had an idea I was looking at my empty jam jar there and I thought you know tomorrow we're planning on having a science experiment involving pond water of all things but I think I will also teach the kids about canning and use that as an opportunity to replenish my jams supply I think that's the plan all right got the jam spread out and then I'm just gonna add the second half oat flour and butter mixture and then just carefully press that you don't have to push too hard cuz you don't want to disturb what's below just give it a light Pat to kind of anchor it on there and that's it now this is gonna bake for about 30 to 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven the strawberry oatmeal bars are done and they look and smell so good I'm just gonna let these cool on the counter overnight and then I'll cut them into squares tomorrow anyone's dessert

[Music] last year I went to a spa in Arizona and I fell in love with this rustic salad that I had and it reminded me of one of my all-time Italian favorites panzanella salad which is basically an Italian bread salad there we go so I've taken whole wheat bread and cut it into about 1 inch cubes and I'm gonna spread it out and to that I'm also going to add course some veggies some artichokes so when you thaw them out and then to give them some flavor we're gonna grill it all so a little bit of olive oil just a tad just to kind of moisten everything just like that and then you just want to toss it all together I'm gonna put it on a hot grill pan and hear that sizzling that's what you want and that'll give you nice grill marks and a little bit of that smoky flavor put the tongue you just want to even it all out the bread and the artichokes are looking good all right so to my whole-wheat panzanella salad I'm also going to add some black olives I happen to adore black olives now you could add green olives if you want to or kalamata olives but there's something about black olives they're very tender and slightly sweet so just want to cut them in half you want to get pitted black olives I want to keep everything kind of like a rough chop everything sort of the same size okay so now put the olives in there we're also going to add some tomatoes now tomatoes are one of those traditional ingredients in pens and neljä salad so kind of have to have it and they add sweetness little crispness and lots of color and then cut them in wedges [Music] so tomatoes are done now gotta have some freshness of course it's a spa salad after all so color and some clean movie tastes and flavors so fresh and clean tasting nice colors we got all of that now taking the bread and the artichokes and the riff from the bread and the artichokes just heats up all the rest of the ingredients and it brings out the flavor of the tomatoes and the olives and then we put the dressing over it it's gonna help absorb everything so now I'm gonna make the dressing and I'm going to keep it really simple some white wine vinegar is very light so it's perfect for this salad and won't overpower the rest of the flavors in the salad we're also going to add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil not too much just a little remember this kind of oil is good for you and you need it to keep your skin your hair everything looking so vibrant and beautiful and of course very Italian give it a nice little whisk very easy dressing a little bit of salt and some freshly ground black pepper Jenna has to finish off the season make sure the salads get enough salt and pepper in it and just pour it right over the top everything will just absorb the dressing I just want to toss it everything kind of gets combined [Music] don't you grab really go wow a little Bever Blackhall of them their whole sweetness and that artichoke

[Music] so the first thing I want to make for my lunch today by getting facial is a crunchy noodle salad with lots of Asian spices so I'm going to start with thin pasta actually like thin spaghetti for seems to absorb the flavor the best go down the bowl okay the next thing is sugar snap pea it's about a pound I'm going to salt the water and then blanch them for about 3 to 5 minutes just until they're crisp tender okay first guy is going to the salad and the red peppers and the next thing is the sugar snap peas shock them first which means take them out of the boiling water putting them ice water stop the cooking really sets the color and it stops them from getting overcooked just takes a second [Music] perfect just make sure they're really cold and they are right into the salad it's really cold okay now this soft got great flavor okay the first name is called a vegetable oil I don't use olive oil here because I want the other Asian flavors come out I wanted it clear oil no flavor in total a quarter of a cup of rice wine vinegar you find this in the Asian section means grocery store third of a cup of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil this is a clear one takes the one that's the dark one and it's got lots of flavor one tablespoon of honey give it a little sweetness and to close the chaff garlic so what's the spoon of grated ginger if you want to hatter you can always put more in okay and this is a good step 1/2 cup of peanut butter that's really what gives it sort of an Indonesian flavor and you want to use smooth peanut butter and then just whisk it all together you can make the sauce way in exam and you can make the salad in advance but not too far because actually the soy sauce will break down the noodles I think the less I'm going to put in the sauce is some toasted sesame seeds I trusted them in a dry pan just put about two tablespoons in we've saved the rest to decorate the salad okay right on the salad so this is the warm noodles is spaghetti tin spaghetti and the scallions sugar snap peas red peppers toss it all together I like lots of sauce on it you some chopped parsley such a rough chop and then some more sesame seeds so it looks like sesame perfect
so I've got four smashed cloves of garlic that smells delicious I'm going to do a little bit of mustard in there as well I got some rosemary I'm gonna chop up do my mustard yeah baby this is a very zesty sort of marinade going on all right a little lemony fresh brightness my microplane one of my favourite pieces of kitchen equipment so I can be zesty but very easy easy breezy now the zest just the yellow part because when we get to the white it ends up not tasting good it's Pippi all right lemony fresh delicious a little juice of that lemon as well let's use the whole shootin match alright we'll do a little seed ectomy before we put it in there alright squeeze that in okay one more seed acta me one more half of a lemon juice e juice delicious little pinch of crushed red give things a nice little spicy kick and my rosemary I love rosemary one of my favorite herbs ever I try to use this as much as I can alright so we're going to pick this guy pull it off backwards and we're going to give it a fine chop hanger steaks are traditionally are pretty cheap II cut of meat not so much anymore it's like the minute something gets popular everyone starts to buy it and then it's not cheap anymore it's kind of sad so okay so we noticed like the shape of these kind of things they're kind of a weird-looking cut of meat there's just big membrane and fat thing running down the middle of that so we're going to just carefully cut this into two it's and then it comes out to two lovely beautiful portions of meat if you don't feel comfortable doing this you know what go ahead and have your butcher separate it for you go ahead and give these a little a little massage I'm massaging my meat making it taste delicious okay there we go so who you do it with the mustard marinade right on there yeah booties are looking good so uh it's amazing how much you can smell that mustard already mustard and lemon and rosemary and garlic smells delicious all right so steak let's give a poke to medium-rare on hanger steaks we go a little more than that they start to get tough and dry because this is a very muscley cut of meat so yeah but look at that that's like the perfect portion for one so I'm going to turn my grill off I'm gonna let these hang out so the juices will redistribute my steaks will stay nice and juicy yourself look at that Oh beautiful good-looking stuff so it cut this on the bias and then it will fan out beautifully
now let's start off marinating our meat because they're gonna be here in a minute and here we have our beautiful meat which we need to marinate in layers because you want all those flavors in every single layer you want all that flavors so we need one layer of meat and then one layer of yummy flavorings which is a little bit of orange so mashed garlic just throw it up on top there we go and then some onion a little bit of soy sauce you're gonna end up using about half a cup so we'll do half right now and the other half with the last layer that looks good and then half the beer that smells amazing and it's not even on the grill yet and the flavors haven't even marinated so this is gonna be absolutely amazing and then we do we have one more piece of meat we can put on top and then we add all this stuff that we have right here just layer it on top I'll last amount of beer and the beer I mean I'm not gonna get into like the whole carbonation and why this works all you need to know is this is gonna help the flavors absorb better a little bit of soy sauce let's fire up that grill [Music] so you just need to grill this meat about six minutes per side [Music]
[music playing] OK. So now I just want to drizzle them with a little bit of olive oil, just 'cause it helps create that nice golden crust. Just a tiny bit. Give it a little moisture. And then I'm gonna put it on my hot grill pan-- [sizzling] so we get nice grill marks on it, just like that. While that grills, time to make the pesto. So we're gonna use some peas for the pesto. This is a little bit different. And we're not gonna add any nuts in it either. We're gonna make this really clean and really easy. One and a half cups of peas that I defrosted. And we need some garlic, and one clove is plenty. You want to flavor the pesto, and I've always got garlic laying around. And that's what's so great with all the things I'm making today, ingredients that you would have laying around the house. And you just kind of throw them together and create this really gourmet yummy meal. Get rid of that. I'm just gonna cut the garlic in half, and then the food processor can do all the rest. And we need a little salt and pepper. And now we need to grab some Parmesan cheese. We need to get it nice and cheesy. And I've got some pre-grated Parmesan cheese. And I just need about a half a cup, so we'll fill that right in there. You need some cheese to really bind the pesto together, and it gives it lots of flavor. There we go. So Parmesan cheese, we're gonna give this a quick little whirl. And then we're gonna add the olive oil. [processing] So let's add a third of a cup of olive oil. [processing] The pesto is done. So it's time to flip the bread, so that way, we get it nice and crusty on the other side. Let's see. Yep. And really, you just want some grill marks on it. And some of them will get darker than others. It's OK. So we're gonna let those just grill a little bit longer, just about a minute or two. And now, let me show you what I top the crostini with-- some cherry tomatoes. Now this just makes it look really pretty. When you bite into it, you've got the sweetness from the peas, but you've also got like that juicy sweetness from the tomatoes too. So this is what I do. I grab the tomatoes, little cherry tomatoes, and I cut them in thirds, and then just lay them right on top of the pea pesto. There we go. Grab a spoon, and I grab some of the pea pesto and just kind of smooth it out. And you can do as thick or thin layer as you want. But it's a cheesy, sweet goodness, just like that. And on the second one, there we go. Nice toasty bread. Awesome. Then I take the tomatoes and I put them right on top. And see how pretty that looks, the red against the green? It's mouthwatering, it looks so good. A few simple ingredients transform crusty bread into something truly gourmet.
[music playing] INA: Fabulous zucchini pancakes that are always the answer when you can't figure out what to do with all that zucchini. Need about two zucchini, usually large ones from the grocery store. Or I'm doing four small ones. So the first thing I want to do is add some red onion, about two tablespoons of grated red onion. OK, two eggs-- just like making pancakes. I use extra large eggs. Just give it a quick beat to combine the yolks and the whites. OK, right in. Next is flour. And it really depends on how wet the zucchini is-- about six to eight tablespoons. This is pretty dry, so I'm gonna try starting with six. What I find is as it sits, if I don't cook it right away, gets a little wetter. So I'll add another tablespoon of flour. OK, one teaspoon of baking powder so they rise nicely. One teaspoon of salt-- want them to taste good. Half a teaspoon of pepper. OK. Give it to big stir and just see how wet it is. OK. This looks pretty good, actually. OK. Time to make the pancakes. So, big pan. I like to combine olive oil and butter, then you get the high burning temperature of olive oil and the flavor of butter. I like to just use a big tablespoon right out of the drawer and just put heaping tablespoons right into the hot pan. You can make these as big or as small as you like. But I like them just about that size. Zucchini can be fairly boring vegetable. But I like to do it lots of different ways. I roast it with garlic, grill them. So these look about done. It's two minutes on one side. When they're nice and brown on that side, flip them over. And actually, you can also tell like pancakes. They get little bubbles on the top. And that's how you know they're ready to flip. The nice thing about these is you can actually make them in advance, about 30 minutes in advance, keep them warm in a 300 degree oven. I hate making something just before dinner. More than 30 minutes, they'll be soggy. OK, perfect. Two minutes on that side. I'm just going to get a plate. I have to try them. Now this is my idea of eat your vegetables. I can't wait to taste one. A little salt. Mm. Mm, that's so good. The zucchini's delicious, actually. It's not boring at all. And you can really taste the sauteed onion and the pancake part. This is going to be really good side dish for dinner.
[Music] this is a completely no bake cheesecake I need a little rubber now remember when I started cooking the chicken I took out the tub of cream cheese you need 12 ounces that's a brick and a half or a 12 ounce tub and you want to soften it up a little that's why I brought it out right when I started cooking dinner he just put that in the food processor with about a teaspoon of vanilla extract just eyeball it who smells great and then sour cream that's just to loosen it up about two-thirds of a cup a small container an 8 ounce container that is a cup so you just eyeball about 2/3 of that it gives a little tang to then I like to have strawberries going all through the cheesecake not just on top to garnish with so I just coarsely just hull a few and kind of run the knife through them and put them in the food processor right along with the cheese that way you get a little bits of strawberry going all through the cheesecake that's fine and now you need about a cup of confectioner's sugar just to sweeten this up again I just eyeball that too it's about a cup ok food processor together let it rip just about there and it gets a beautiful pink blush too from the strawberries great now I've got these little individual graham cracker crusts you look for these right on the baking aisle on the bottom there where they have all the other pie crusts and it's so cute just makes them fun to eat this little individual size you're gonna line these up they have little liners in them to set the graham crackers and make a little assembly line here garbage Bowl those and I'm gonna show you a neat trick I do this to fill cannolis i buy the shells down at the bakery I don't make those but I will make the filling because I like a little bit of chopped candied citrus in it then I put the filling inside a plastic food-storage bag and I just cut one end off and you make a makeshift pastry bag so I'm just gonna spoon this filling right into that food storage bag squish it down and see that helps you make it really easy Phil to these I'm just garnishing up the last of my easy no bake cheesecake that's just sour cream sugar little confectioner sugar cream cheese and strawberries all whipped up together and in those little individual pie shells it's fantastic
you'll love my beat pops with pineapple and parsley sauce they're easy to eat and full of flavor and the parsley sauce really makes the dish glisten so it tastes amazing and looks beautiful on the plate I'm going to make the marinade for my beef pops I'm gonna start with a little bit of garlic now I need two cloves of garlic you don't want to make it too garlicky but we want to make it taste really good and these beef pops are really cool because I get the beef cut in little cubes and you stick them on skewers with little pieces of pineapple just about the same size and between the caramelizing of the pineapple which makes it super sweet and the marinating beef which is super tender it ends up being really yummy a little bit of parsley and I'm just going to cut the stems off the parsley flat-leaf Italian parsley super yummy and even if a little bit of the stem gets in here it's no big deal the food processor kind of chops it all up so garlic parsley we need red wine vinegar and the red wine vinegar just tenderizes the meat just use two tablespoons there we go it's nice and acidic it'll be nice with the sweetness of the pineapple red wine vinegar then we need a teaspoon of sugar getting the right combinations in the marinade that make beef pops so yummy little sugar to balance out the acidity of the red wine vinegar it's funny there's a purpose for everything some salt and just a little bit of black pepper because I'm gonna make it nice and spicy with some red pepper chili flakes and just add just a little bit here I want to give it just a little bit of kick so when they bite into it they're like YUM because I like the heat with the sweetness of the pineapple together really good so I just want to give it a quick little pulse kind of break it up then we're gonna add 1/2 a cup of olive oil here we go a little Italian in this let it come together and it's beautiful and green and that's what I like you'll see the green on the meat and you'll also see the the yellow from the pineapple telling the combination of flavors is phenomenal we'll get rid of this one and grab my bowls and that's what's so great about this is that in no time I have both a marinade and a dipping sauce and it's kind of special and the flavors are sort of different too so it's very special so I'm just gonna dump half of the marinade in here and I grab a little spoon and grab the rest of it and basically just pour the rest of it in here look how beautiful it is have a little kick there we go all right we got all that in there this will hold on to later so I went to the butcher and I had him basically cut up some things about one and a half pounds of beef tenderloin and it's nice and tender so it's kind of melts in your mouth when you eat it and if you want to use a different cut of meat you can but you just have to make sure and let it marinate a little bit longer so about four to five hours if you can use a different cut but my favorite is the beef tenderloin three-quarter inch pieces and I call ahead and just have the butcher do it for me so that way when I have to get you know a party together I can just do it kind of quick cut a few corners so just make sure all the beef is coated with the marinade it smells good I'm very excited about this just want to cover it up a little plastic wrap and I want it to sit in the fridge for a couple of hours to marinate that way the beef can kind of just soak in all the flavors of the marinade so I'm just screwing my beef pops and I just basically just use two pieces of beef and two pieces of pineapple per skewer and the beef is been marinating for like three hours so it's got lots and lots of flavor it smells really good too all right so these guys should be done I'm just gonna pull these guys off kind of nice they smell so good there we go it's super easy to do as long as you marinate the meat you get give it lots and lots of flavor it really is a very simple thing to do oh they're looking good and they smell even better you can see the grill marks looking good so we'll just kind of put them on there look how beautiful this platter is it's like the perfect platter to put something grilled like this my little beef pops pink and pineapple parsley we've got the dipping sauce there we go look how gorgeous that looks
[Music] now on to my pasta arrabiata [Music] little salt in the water I like to salt the water because it flavors the pasta while it's cooking salt brings out the flavor of everything pasta goes in I want to get a little stir I don't want it to stick to the bottom onto the arrabiata sauce now our viata in Italian means angry so that's where the spiciness comes in I'm gonna start with that 1/4 cup of olive oil I want to get the oil heat it up you can see how it gets a little shimmery and glassy on a flavor the olive oil with the garlic listen to that starting to go I don't want to cook them too quickly cuz I don't wanna get any Brown edges I want that olive oil to be just infused with the garlic mmm who doesn't love garlic so it's time for the tomatoes I've got chopped tomatoes here and then I'm not using a can because I want the fresh flavor without having to chop a bunch of fresh tomatoes I love the way the oil makes the tomatoes glisten and you can see the little pieces of garlic in there that to me says flavor is about to hit your mouth little salt pepper my old standby Italian seasoning about 1/4 teaspoon maybe more I like a lot of flavor starting to bubble up and now what makes a pasta arrabiata angry chili flakes depending on how much you want your guests to sweat a quarter to a half a teaspoon now in time for basil so Shifa nod is one of those terms I learned it's just a fancy way of rolling up your basil so you can cut them all together and then when they come out they look like little ribbons and they're just so pretty so I'm gonna take mmm just a little handful and leave that for garnish they should make a perfume basil smelled perfume that's just barely gonna wilt down and then I'm gonna put the pasta and when it's done just gonna do a little taste test to see if that's oh it's definitely hot perfect [Music] time to go in the sauce ready to go now if you don't get drained all the way a little pasta water gets in there that's never a bad thing it's got all that salt and pasta flavor and starch in there just gonna help thicken everything up mm-hmm this looks so good now it's plated [Music] [Music] look how easy and fast that was dinner that quick any day of the week
I know the grilling chicken on the bone can sometimes be a little tricky but I have the perfect recipe that'll help you get it right every time so my pulled chicken with basil dressing so let's start with the marinade for the chicken you really want to marinate the chicken for a little bit to really give it lots of flavor I love grilling chicken but sometimes it can be kind of bland so what I do is I juice one lemon and makes it nice and tart and the lemon kind of keeps everything really moist and gives the chicken lots of flavor I love lemons for that exact reason so now we're gonna season it with a little bit of salt some pepper and some ground-up fennel seeds and I love that licorice flavor that the fennel seeds have so we're gonna add that and then some extra virgin olive oil so it's about a quarter cup of lemon juice and 1/3 of a cup of olive oil really fruity and yummy and then we just whisk this all together it's the easiest marinade ever Cameron you're gonna love it grab the chicken I have bone-in chicken breasts and thighs with the skin on because it keeps it nice and moist and really good they take the marinade and I pour it right into this resealable plastic bag I seal it up and then massage the marinade right on the chicken and then pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes and let it marinate and now we're ready to put it on the grill put it on a hot grill just like that you wanted to be smoking hot just put it down skin side down first and we'll create a little bit of a crust so while that cooks let's make the dressing I take one cup of fresh basil and basil is so sweet and so good it's what I do is I put the fresh basil right in there and basil kind of reminds me of summer time in Italy just smells so fresh and light and it makes the chicken really light and really refreshing as well a little bit of salt some pepper and lemon what I love about lemon zest is how it perfumes the dressing it smells so good all right that's enough lemon zest I'm gonna juice the lemon as well and what I love about this dressing is that it kind of guarantees that the chicken is gonna be nice and moist and flavorful now a garlic clove the Italian in me needs a little bit of garlic in this dressing and let's blend it just to break up the basil and the guy perfect 1/3 cup of extra-virgin olive oil basil smells so good blend it all together so then I just take the loophole and look at that color it looks so pretty I love that great so now the dressing is done so let's check on the chicken all right time to flip the chicken okay so now we're getting it the chicken cooked just right what I like to do is turn they keep it down to about medium-low to finish cooking the chicken so it doesn't burn see you at 8 minutes there's something about perfectly cooked chicken grilled chicken that just makes your mouth water it looks so beautiful
[Music] at Barefoot Contessa we used to make hundreds of pounds of shrimp salad and we used to do it in big pots of boiling water I never really thought it'd add any flavor to the shrimp and then one day we started making chicken salad by roasting the chicken first instead of poaching it and it was so delicious and I thought why not do that with the shrimp you're not gonna believe how easy it is okay start by peeling and deveining the shrimp just run your knife down the back of the shrimp and use a small paring knife to remove the shell and the tail you want to make sure that you get the vena that's that dark little line down the back of the shrimp then put the shrimp on a sheet pan for this salad you need two and a half pounds of 16 to 20 count shrimp drizzle them with olive oil sprinkle them with salt and pepper and mix it all together then spread them out in a single layer so they cook evenly and roast them in a 400-degree oven for six to eight minutes until they're pink firm and just barely cooked through now see what I mean about simple that's simple okay so the shrimp are gonna go into a big bowl oh these smells so good I want the shrimp so that they're warm not really hot and not cold they absorb the sauce best that way good news about this shrimp salads you can make a lot of it at one time it's not as much sauce as you like probably most of this sauce I never put the shrimp into the sauce I put the sauce into the shrimp just so you can moderate how much sauce you know give that a good toss fantastic and then the last thing I was add is the vegetables and the herbs get just the right proportionate so this is dill red onion and capers it's gonna be fantastic I always hold just a little bit back to decorate the top mix that together I love the smell of this shrimp and red onion and dill and the roasted shrimp it makes such a difference you won't believe it a little salt and pepper just to finish it so we're sort of that so leper at the end that you take first hits your tongue just have to make sure it's okay you never know [Music] after best from shallot I ever had we're gonna taste the orange mmm I'm just gonna let these sit for about 20 minutes and let the flavors absorb when the Shrimpers just slightly warm they absorb the sauce best and then I'm gonna put it in the fridge [Music]
[Music] when I have adults and kids coming for dinner I always want to do something that both of them love I'm gonna make a strawberry rhubarb crisp so I've got four cups of strawberries and I cut them in 1 inch dice which mean it's cutting most of them in half four cups of rhubarb I was really lucky to get really tender rhubarb it's in season for such a short time but when it is I love it 3/4 of a cup of sugar and this I'm going to do one may have tea spoons of grated orange zest and then later I'm gonna put the orange actually into it one of the things I love about crisp is you can make any kind of crisp and it's really seasonal when apples are in Anik apple crisp in the summer I make peaches and blueberries or peaches and raspberries it's a classic nursery dessert but it's really delicious okay so that's got to be at least one and a half teaspoons right into the mixture and then to thicken it a little bit I'm actually going to take the juice of the orange and some cornstarch kind of like making a pie just something to absorb all the juices and so it thickens it a little bit so this should be about a half a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice and a tablespoon of cornstarch it's a good idea to dissolve it in advance so you don't get any lumps in the fruit lumps not a good idea I'm gonna pour it right in and mix it all together give a big toss it's really important to cut the fruit and sort of big chunks cuz you don't want to end up with a jam for this you want to put fruit crisp so this is the crumble topping which is sometimes called a crisp one cup of flour I use pretty much the same kind of topping for each one it's just the perfect amount of crumble and sweetness and it's a good foil for the fruit 1/2 a cup of brown sugar 1/2 a cup of white sugar [Music] have a teaspoon of salt even sweet things need salt one cup of oatmeal I just think it's a really nice crunch okay give it a little stir I love the texture of the crispy oatmeal against the sweet fruit so next is butter I need 12 tablespoons of butter I'm just gonna dice it up and then mix it in into the bowl and just mix it in until the butter is like the size of peas okay that should do it so this is what it looks like in the bowl it's just big crumbles and all I have to do now is just put it on top of the fruit just distribute it evenly on the top you don't really have to cover the entire thing but I think there's enough of the crumble topping that you will this dish is about 11 inches long 8 inches wide and about 2 and 1/2 inches deep it's perfect for this 350 degrees for about an hour and it's gonna be bubbly and juicy and crisp on the top okay strawberry rhubarb Chris that it's really good and a little vanilla ice cream Wow nobody's that all up and we're running some yeah this is the holy heaven yeah
[Music] today on money-saving meal red white and blue cherry pies now let's talk about pie dough this box pie mix very inexpensive this is a dollar thirty one less than making it from scratch can you believe that it's two dollars and forty cents less than buying those pre-roll refrigerated pie dough's so go ahead and get the box we're talking eighty nine ninety cents here that's it all right I added water look at these split no I didn't want to roll these into six balls before I put them in the refrigerator to set up so I could roll them out I just thought it was easier to do it put a little bit of flour onto your counter top and then take these and flatten these out and for the final one and these are also a very fast Bank about 20-25 minutes I want you to notice as I've laid these on the cookie sheet I've laid that kind of over one another because there's not enough room but when you fold them up they'll be plenty of room and you don't even need nonstick cooking spray on here by the way just need a spoon and what I'm gonna do is take my pie filling and you're gonna evenly divide this can of filling now I want to add just a little bit of pumpkin pie spice but a half a teaspoon is gonna take care of all of these everybody knows that pumpkin pie spice is kind of like my money-saving little tip I don't do the cinnamon or nutmeg or allspice or any of those this has everything you need right in it one spice ready to go all the time perfect sweet or savory now come in here and you just want to take your pie dough and make a little rustic tartlet now for the blueberries just a few on top of each and look at my blueberries in that pan by the way they are ready to go that's gonna be the topping when these pies are done okay and I'm gonna do a quick mouth wash that's gonna make them nice and shiny as they bake off and I'm also gonna sprinkle these with sugar so that milk is gonna help that sugar stay in there now for our sugar the pie shells on these are gonna get nice and toasted Brown and they're gonna be beautiful so they go into your oven for about 30 minutes that's it my oven is preheated to 400 degrees they are beauties can I just tell you I cannot wait to taste one of these too they look like pretty little purses onto your plate look at how gorgeous that is now I'm gonna add a little bit of ice cream so hot it's already melting on there it's perfect and a bit of mint from my garden and then what I'm gonna do is take my blueberry sauce and just drizzle that around a little bit of this goes a long way that is beautiful
okay so we're going to first start with some ribs now we have some pork ribs here nice big meaty this spice rub is going to do a couple of things it's going to help tenderize it's going to help create a crust when we smoke the ribs so we have some paprika some ancho chili powder some pasilla powder New Mexican red chilies some coriander seeds and some cumin and a little black pepper and some salt okay so we're gonna mix up our spice rub and that's gonna go on top of the ribs and then we also have the maple glazed maple maple syrup and horseradish glaze and this is gonna sort of act as my barbecue sauce although it's not gonna be tomato base like tomato base or mustard base like you might be used to or vinegar base so we're gonna put the maple syrup in here okay lots of horseradish okay lots matter of fact I'm gonna put this whole bottle in there some Dijon mustard okay and then some more chili powder whisk this up and this is really gonna act like a glaze it's gonna get it's gonna give a lot of moisture obviously a lots of flavor and it's actually because of the heat and the sugar content it's gonna actually caramelize the ribs so you're gonna get that nice sort of caramelized texture on the outside give me a little sweet from the maple syrup it's gonna be a little spicy from the horseradish and from the chili powder and of course the mustard okay now we have our ribs and I'm gonna take the spice rub [Music] and why do they call it rug could you rub it in I'm just gonna rub it in on one side like this all right so now we just kind of rub these in very nicely now some recipes will say that you know you should let this sit for you know four hours or eight hours but you know for me I don't really think it makes a difference as long as you rub it in really well and then we can go over to our smoker come on over the idea here is that you start the charcoal and you take some woodchips and you you soak the wood chips and you put the wood chips right on top of the charcoal to create the smoke and then we can close this up and we want to cook this to a you know about 220 degrees for about 4 hours and then we'll come back [Music] four hours later what you want to see the rub it's become part of the crust now most of the work is done but they're not done quite yet now we're gonna we're gonna slide them with some of that maple glaze I'm gonna finish them on the grill now some people like their you know their ribs dry without sauce but I like to slather a lot of sauce on here little glaze get some more moisture going and then we'll get that nice caramelization on the outside of it I mean you can actually smoke your ribs a day a day or two ahead of time and as soon as your your crowd comes over you can finish them off on your and your charcoal grill not bad

I'm just making a quick soup. This is a really quick and easy corn and cheese chowder. I've had some onions cooking in some butter, and I threw in some pieces of bacon. Now, I'll just stir this around and let it cook. And I've also got some diced bell pepper. I've got red, orange, and yellow, because they're so pretty together. But you can use whatever you have on hand. OK, I'm going to let the peppers cook. And then I've shaved the kernels off five cobs of corn, and I'm just going to dump the corn in. This is a piece of cake, this soup recipe, but you wouldn't know it when you taste it. It is extremely impressive and yummy. Now, stir the corn around. OK, now I'm going to add a quarter cup of flour. Just sprinkle it over the ingredients and give it a stir. And now I'll just pour in some chicken broth, as I dribble it across the counter. So I'm going to grab half and half. You can use milk instead of half and half, but why would you want to do that? So I'm just going to add a little salt, good amount of pepper, and just give it a stir. And that is it. All you need to do is put the lid on and let it simmer for about 15 minutes or so. Oh, my. Oh, it looks so good. It's really thickening up. The kitchen smells divine. Now, I'm just going to finish off the soup by adding some cheese. I've got a cup of Monterey Jack, which I think is great in soups, because it's so creamy and it melts so nicely. And then I'm also going to add a cup of Pepper Jack cheese, and that's going to add a nice kick. I'll stir it in. Oh, the cheese really, really sends this soup over the top. So good. And then last thing, I've got some sliced green onions, about 1/3 cup or so. And that is one yummy soup. But I think I should make sure it's one yummy soup. I'm going to give it a taste. Mm. Yep, my suspicions were confirmed. It's perfect.

[Music] lemons are one of the most versatile things that we have in the kitchen we can use them for marinades for sauces for salad dressings for desserts the funny thing is we would never eat a lemon just by itself ooh a little sour we have a few different varieties here so what do we look for when we buy these guys they should be nice and heavy that means they have lots of juice in them they should be really shiny and the skin should be nice and oily one of my favorite varieties of lemons is the Meyer lemon this is available in the springtime and this is a cross between a mandarin or a tangerine and a good old-fashioned lemon and it is just an amazing beautiful wonderful smell so let's talk about lemon curd we all know lemon curd yes this deliciousness right here it's kind of like pudding lemon lemon curd sort of a little mix between eggs sugar and then we whisk in some butter and let it set up I'm using the zest of the lemon it's amazing when you start to do this how much this smells the zest is just the colored part of the lemon once we start to get through to the white it gets really bitter tasting so we stop I'm using a fantastic piece of kitchen equipment called a microplane this is great for zesting I'm zesting my Meyer lemon zest onto some blueberries I'm going to toss in a little bit of sugar hey sugar so we give this a little stir and let's for fun do a little mint chiffonade this is a very fancy word for cutting little minty goodness he strips all right let's give that a little toss in there and it's amazing how much that will really brighten up the flavor and a little lemon juice oh yeah you are so good-looking let's take our macerated blueberries and assemble it with a little bit of Meyer lemon curd for a really quick and easy springtime dessert little lemon curd a little blueberries whipped cream is that good look beautiful I'll see you in a minute so dessert for later but let's talk about what else we can do with lemons so I have some lemon juice that I took out of the inside of my lemons I've got lemon zest to really punctuates everything brings a beautiful good freshness to everything extra virgin olive oil little chopped sage and rosemary this is how I rolled when I worked in Italy we did this a lot with grilled chicken so a little bit of crushed red pepper just for some fun and some garlic why because it tastes good let's give this a little stir let's give it a little pinch of salt as well and that we're just gonna pour it over some chicken I have chicken thighs here we let this hang out I cover it and put it in the fridge overnight or on my counter for up to two hours but not more than that I grill my chicken so look at these Oh baby do those look good and along with my chicken I go ahead and I grilled some lemon halves do these look beautiful they get really caramelized in lovely lemons for my marinade lemons for my dessert lemons for salad dressing lemons lemons everywhere everywhere I use a lemon it helps make my dish a superstar
so we're gonna do sort of like a soy ginger garlic marinade you know basically like the Chinese marinade for for our next shrimp and we're gonna start off with some fresh ginger the great thing about ginger is it's sweet it's spicy and its really no substitute for the flavor so everything in the blender some ginger some lime juice some scallions you can use an onion oh I'm gonna use a shallot and then some garlic [Music] and then some soy sauce this is really going to be the foundation of your marinade you know you have the pungency of the of the of the garlic and the shallots and the and the green onions and you're gonna have the sweet and spiciness of the ginger we also need a little sugar not too much and actually the sugar will actually help to create sort of a nice little caramelization on the outside of the shrimp together with the saltiness of the soy sauce lots of flavors going on here this is what I call shrimp right yeah okay again we're gonna leave the shell on here okay and we're gonna put a little of peanut oil into the marinade [Music] just pour it over sounds great I love that ginger okay ready go to the grill alright let's spread these out really want all these flavors to kind of cook in there you know the sugar the soy sauce the ginger the scallions the garlic all those flavors no come together we blend them all together and now that we want to make them part of the shrimp so that when you bite into these shrimp you'll pick up at least two or three of those flavors right away and you'll know that they're Asian style I would just sort of slice up a little green scallion garnish go check on the shrimp now you have to be careful with these because remember we do have some sugar in there they're gonna really caramelize pretty quickly let me show you what I'm talking about oh yeah that's that's actually exactly what we're looking for [Music] little lime scallions family-style [Music]
we're going with what we call an 8-3 1+1 rub and what we're talking about here is parts eight parts of light brown sugar three parts of kosher salt and one part of chilli powder plus one which we'll get to shortly now seal up nice and tight in a mason jar or some other jar that you've washed and shake to combine we'd like to mix things up a little as a matter of fact we've discovered there are six things that we like to mix up into that one part starting with black pepper now these are just small amounts that are going to add up to the one part cayenne jalapeno seasoning which is really just dried and ground jalapenos with some other seasons added little old bay personal favorite of mine rubbed or dried thyme for an herbal note and that leaves us with just enough room for onion powder there we go yeah that's one part now that goes on top and again we cover and shake now lay each slab out on its own big piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil and make sure that the shiny side is down that'll make the heat come in just a little bit slower which is good now lay on the rub and don't be prissy about it contact is critical push on and flip now this other side doesn't matter quite as much so don't go overboard it's mostly the convex side that we're after why aluminum foil well because we can basically shape the thing at the pan to fit the food which is a good thing and of course you don't have to wash it I love that so break it right up in the middle and just fold it over once and then push down you don't want to do any fancy crimping because we've got to get back into these to add some liquid later there now these are going to go right back into the refrigerator for at least one hour before cooking you could do this well the night before and it would be even better now wash those porky hands so n28 microwavable container will go for moisture and acidity one cup of white wine bolster that with two tablespoons of white wine vinegar if you don't have white wine vinegar it's okay just use any vinegar that you've got two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce that takes care of the salty now for the sweet a tablespoon of honey and I never measure this stuff I just figured that each squeeze is a teaspoon so three squeezes one two three three teaspoons makes a tablespoon now really last but not least two smashed and chopped cloves of garlic you don't have to be pretty with it you don't have to be fancy with it now why garlic hey garlic don't need no reason there we go and look it's pre chopped for us so if you smash right you don't have to do anything else just scoop that right in and lit it up we're going to put this in the microwave for one minute meanwhile we will prep the ribs just open up one end of the crimp and kind of turn it into a funnel looks like a couple of big silver widemouth bass make sure that the opening is over the tray in case you do any spilling which I usually do half the liquid goes into this side and half the liquid goes into this side and just give the tray a little bit of a tilt just to kind of distribute everything down there here a gurgle gurgle then crimp up the ends next stop for these bad boys is 725 degree oven for two and a half hours now aggressive oven management is required here so cook by your instruments namely the oven thermometer if it gets too hot in here the meats going to dry out in spite of all that liquid in that case no amount of dissolved gelatin in the world will ever bring that lip-smacking goodness back when it comes to ribs speed kills so do not attempt to pick up the pace on this your patience will be rewarded well the timer says the braise is done but there's only really one way to know for sure and that's to look and feel so slide out your rack and just open up one end of one of the pouches you can do this with that with paper towels but I'm trying to sacrifice myself of science here there and I just grab one end lift up and then reach for one of the pouch one of the ribs further back just grab it and give it a twist now if you feel the bone just rotating in the socket that means that the collagen has started to dissolve around the bone that means that these ribs are you done so I'm gonna get my saucier ups you can use any wide pan and just just lay lay the packet right in the middle of the pan like that take your kitchen shears and just snip a hole in the foil it's like opening a nice barrel of wine it'll drain right out now all in all I'd say that we got about cup and a half of liquid back out of this and those are fine liquid assets indeed ten minutes later and a humble braising liquid is reduced down to a barbecue sauce that's suitable for bottling and selling for six bucks a shot that would probably require special licenses and permits so we'll just stick to this get this off of the heat by the way because when it gets to this consistency the next step is burned and it happens very quick so let's go ahead and open up the ribs but do not remove them from the foil oil is actually going to help us get them colored once they are under the broiler now grab your nearest basting brush this is the only way and literally paint the glaze right on to the meat this goes under the broiler but I'm not about to tell you how long reason is I don't want you to walk away from this even for a minute because in as little as 30 seconds that sugar is going to start to bubble on top that's in the glaze it's going to start to caramelize and in as little as a minute it's going to be Brown ten more seconds it'll be black so keep a very close eye on it
[upbeat music]
[music playing] Let's start with the tilapia. We have this beautiful fish here. And we're going to make a sauce and grill the fish basically at the same time. So what we're going to do is make a version of a classic butter sauce, known as a beurre blanc in French. And what we're going to do is we're going to take some shallots. We're going to peel our shallots. And take some shallots, some white wine. Some lemon juice then some lemon zest. So first, we'll take the zest off. And you might as well squeeze some of the juice in there, too. OK. OK, so we're going to use our tilapia fillets. And the tilapia is a-- it's a white fish. It's very mild in flavor, but it has a nice density to it. It's a good, dense fish. Now if you can't find tilapia, we could use something like red snapper or halibut. Something along those lines. And we're going to just rub that with some canola oil, and salt, and pepper until we get it on the grill. Season it with salt and pepper. OK. Four minutes on one side. Give it a flip. Another four minutes, maybe eight minutes total. Now a flakier fish-- such as tilapia, or red snapper, or halibut-- is going to be a little tougher to grill than say, something that's in a steak form-- like tuna or swordfish. But the key to this is letting it cook so that it comes away from the grill almost on it's own so you can give it one quick flip. Just like that. We're going to cover this up. And we're going to let this cook. We're going to sort of keep the heat in there. And then really it should only be about maybe a minute and a half longer, and then we're going to take it off. Because we don't want this fish to overcook or the asparagus. So get our fish off the grill before it overcooks. And that's another thing that people say to me all the time. That they'd like to cook fish on the grill but they overcook it. Just take it off a little bit sooner than you think it's going to take. I mean, it's really going to cook almost in no time. OK. Now what we started here was some shallots, some lemon zest, and some lemon juice. And now we're going to add just a touch of heavy cream. Just a touch. This is a really good trick. It's a good way to stabilize a butter sauce so that it doesn't separate. Tricks of the trade. OK. And now we're just going to start adding a whole bunch of unsalted butter. OK. Let's go back over to the fish. OK. And now we could add a whole bunch of capers in here. And we can actually start to plate the fish with the sauce. Give it some flavor. [music playing]
[Music] I've got some ratty Ettore pasta which is really cute and frilly and I drained it and rinsed it under cold water because I need it to be cold when I add all the other ingredients and now I'm gonna fry up some bacon this is one of the reasons this is a kid-friendly pasta salad I've never met a kid that argued with bacon I'll put it about eight slices or so I'm going to cook the bacon until it's just beyond the chewy States just so it's slightly crisp okay now I'm going to get started on the dressing I'll start with half a cup of mayonnaise and then I'll add a half cup of milk and then just plain white vinegar I'll add about three tablespoons so I'll whisk this together yeah that looks just right you don't want it to be too too thick you want it to be nice and horrible so it'll coat all the pasta I'll add some salt and plenty of black pepper give it a stir and that's the dressing simple as that okay and with that that bacon is done don't want it to get too too crisp I'm gonna drain it on a paper towel so the pasta salad won't be too greasy all right now let that cool for a minute throw together the salad I'll just put the cheese in I've got about a half a pound of mild cheddar cheese very palatable for all kids and their lovely yellow and red tomatoes I've got about 10 ounces of tomatoes give or take and now the bacon is cool I'm just gonna give it a rough chop there's almost more extras than there is pasta in the pasta salads then for a little flavor I've got three green onions [Music] now I'll just pour in the dressing [Music] I need a spoon for this oh so pretty now to really send this kid-friendly pasta salad over the top I'm going to add some fresh basil this is just perfect got the right amount of bacon right amount of cheese the girls are gonna love it
now let's start our sauce for penny wise pumpkin pasta I guess it's also penny wise because the whole wheat pasta is a wise choice it has more protein and more fiber in it and put a little Evo on the bottom of a nice high sided skillet so we can toss our penne with our honking sauce trim up some garlic here let's get the shallots in first though I got two big beautiful shallots they'll take a little longer to cook up now shallots are their own thing they're somewhere between a garlic and an onion and flavor but you could certainly use up some onion if you have that on hand instead now let's trim up our garlic and get that in there I'm just gonna grate it right down into the pan really turn that down a little bit now now that it's got some heat under it and it's rocking and rolling pull a cop side just eyeball of your duck all of your pumpkin the sauce is made of a couple of shallots and a few cloves of garlic sautéed an EVO oh then you add in two cups of stock and one 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree make sure you don't get the pumpkin pie filling okay that's a little over the top with the sweet flavorings now keep your stock on hand just in case your sauce gets a little bit too thick i seasoned it up with a few dashes of hot sauce well actually I like things hot so I used a few teaspoons you can start with a few dashes and work up from there for yourselves and then I seasoned it to taste with a little freshly grated nutmeg so the thing that makes them go hmmm what is that in there and just a pinch tiniest little pinch of cinnamon salt and pepper of course now it's bubbling away and I'm gonna turn that back down to low so all the flavors can combine and it will just simmer up beautifully just running my knife through home seven or eight leaves of nice fresh sage go so beautiful with the flavor of not only the pumpkin but the earthiness that I was talking about I've got my whole wheat penne drained I'm going to add my whole wheat pasta to my pumpkin sauce how pretty is that and a whole can - it's about a 15 ounce cancer about two cups of pumpkin puree mixed in there mmm yeah it smells good shallots garlic I've got some nice fresh sage stirred in there one little guy was trying to escape uh-uh no brother you're going in okay let's pour this out into the big serving bowl from the big Black Cauldron oh this is so good and it's very nutritious guys yeah you've got lots of fiber of course from the pumpkin and our whole wheat pasta extra protein from using pumpkin pasta
the foundation recipes they're really quite interesting how are they the gift that keeps giving I think that a lot of people have because it's a successive Food Network because of Emeril of course and making it possible for everybody that came after him and making it fun to be back in the kitchen from when I was a kid the galloping gourmet and Julia Child get all these people getting everybody back into the kitchen it's all cyclical sooner or later we all get back in there but foundation recipes are basically just learning how to cook like the generations before you don't pay people to buy chicken cutlets buy chicken you know learn how to make stock separated out into several meals take that whole piece of something and learn the basics of how to provide for yourself whether you need a couple of bucks in your pocket or you don't it really is cool to be in the kitchen and know that you spent half of maybe the person standing on line behind you and you can just go home and be the boss of that and get all there is an enormous pay off emotionally when you know you've used all of something and you've paid respect to your economy to your farm our genomic the food comes from to getting all of your dollars worth out of it you just feel better you're not throwing away anything and using the idea of foundation recipe if you learn how to cook a big thing and turn into several little things or you learn the basics of cooking that's what i mean by foundation recipes they give you the foundation for your whole life and you do anything with him after that and they're great things to pass on the next generation because they've been here as long as we've been here
I think is a week in a day I started work with food network well over a decade ago and Brooke Johnson is a great friend and mentor of mine and she runs for the scripts family of course fee network and she was launching Cooking Channel and she asked me if I could come up with a new promise it had been more than a decade since we launched 30-minute meals so she said what sitting prom is going to be we want to have something for cooking channel so I sat down is that you know I do every day of my life with my little composition books and I just started playing around with words 30 minute meals came about because Domino's promised to deliver pizza in 30 minutes or less so I thought if someone would spend 30 minutes waiting for take-out pizza David spent 30 minutes making dinner and at the time I was working as a buyer and a floor manager food market where everyone was a state worker and we've gone through two or three generations of people that didn't know how to make the most basic of dinners for themselves so my boss and I strategized that we would move more groceries in a market where people didn't know I'm cook if we crafted a cooking class series that we're all based around easy dinners about the same amount of time stoners his anything whole idea sort of fell apart in the Domino's got sued by a few people they had to stop making that promise and we sold the classes series of six of 30 miles before we cost it out what the chef's would want to teach them and all of the local restaurants so my boss said to me she just started scratched your head one of my best girlfriends today 20-something years later she said well what you gonna do do you know everybody likes your food why don't you just teach the class we know we can avoid you and I started teaching 30-minute meals to literally sell more groceries to our own customers and they they really enjoyed that we taught a three hour course and I mean we my boss was my backup she did my knees and help me set up and we have these three hour classes where we play music and yeah and we we hang out and shop and cook and it was more like a little Clubhouse you know be kings almost like a game but in like a friendly food game and we would teach six based recipes and I have five things if you learn that one discipline if you want to make a color you learning to make this sauce or this gravy or you know make a colored or poached chicken you could do all these different things with that knowledge so if you gave us three hours you would actually get 30 30 minute meals so 30 30 minute meals became this sort of happening in town a lot of people came in and wanted to be a part of the class and it became a say on the news let me started to get hate mail because it wasn't in a book for already one place where anybody could get it so it that thing sort of snowballed and overtook my life in a weird way start took on a life of its own will you resist God early 95 is month twice at gunpoint and go back upstate so design me for this is what working at all hell yeah Oh Donny head welcome Giada Cowan carnival is her full name John is still my friend of his day yeah when went back to the country no I started from scratch and I had to wait a year to get a job in that market it was it was literally a series of accidents that led to 30mm so I'm sitting down to write what's going to be like the succession to that I'm like I have no idea because it happened by accident so I just start dueling things that are popular make-ahead kind of a big thing you know maybe today freezer tomorrow vegan or vegetarian or half the people in the house eat this way and have people in that suit that way so I put all these ideas on a piece of paper and I literally did a market study and I went to the library i will tell me be born under this some people into that how much mail do i get about this and which mother get about that and I came up with week in a day with rachael ray because it rhymes with my name and it had some good research behind and then i sat down to write it became the hardest thing I've ever done trying to deliver a whole workweek of food in one day it's a big promise like you have to make the pantry list realistic you have to make the grocery list not back-breaking you know how are you going to get value with this and at the time they want a cooking channel to raise a bar and be a little bit higher than the bar the food now except say people are you like to cook and they're willing to cook so let's make the recipes a little more appealing to home cooks that are already foodies slight a lot of hills to climb with it um but I I like work I enjoy the feeling of long day's worth of work and so it became a really great project for
guess we're for drizzle DB Yolo down on the bottom of my bagel shop get that nice and uh sprouted some bacon and over here I'm going to turn on my griddle pan so I can make my grilled cheese Sammy's inside-out English muffins I'll explain that to you later yeah by me for here's a jump bacon gonna grab some bacon some celery some fresh bay where you could use dry bay leaf 2 sprigs of thyme and a couple years of corn on the cob I need a couple of bowls to scrape the corn off the cob I'll explain that to you in a few and then she's my basket with my nice starchy potatoes and excellent let's start by getting the bacon in there because you've got our children and that is very small like a lily bitty up through kindergarten or I went to kindergarten mastery Central School when I was real small we lived on Cape Cod so I know we became real chowder guys out here my whole family we love a good scratch out of corn chowder fish chowder you name it we love it this one is one of my favorite recipes because it combines fish chowder and Corchado in one beautiful delicious pot and the actual inspiration for this particular chowder came years and years later when I was growing up I was given his gift a old cookbook from a flea market designed by Barbara Sinatra it was the Sinatra family and friends cookbook and in it Teddy Kennedy had a fish chowder recipe he got me thinking on Schauder I said I'm gonna make my version that lots of corn spiced it up he's a little soft work in his family recipe I put in four or five slices nice smoky bacon slice the bacon lengthwise and then across so you end up when it cooks up these little tiny bacon bits run it all through each other now this is a meal that certainly celebrates the end of summer I love making shouters especially early September you know when it first starts to get crisp and cool at night my favourite time here for chowder anyway this chowder can send you back to those end days of summer any time here always makes me think of Cape Cod of those first few nights when it's chilly enough to throw your sweatshirt on take a cool evening walk that's great like that isn't it it's like a um like a scrapbooking to eat if it appeals to all your flavors meets all of your senses you know one wheel can really take you away all over place almost that later pop this back in the fridge it's coming out and just start traveling and dropping in no particular order and take a few bricks of celery here when you're cooking with celery use all including the leafy tops there's tons of flavors in and don't you know keep this recipe around and only make it and if summer we can still get nice corn on the cob like is in the winter it gets up to two frozen corn kernels couple cups of them for this recipe for my friend and I are always talking about out in this summer it's super smart take time to buy a ton of corn shuck it all up marv oil a little bit scrape down throat and ziplock baggies throw any freezer and you have that nice fresh end of summer corn taste well into the winter months it's a little bit sweeter than any of the frozen corns you can get the grocery store oh they have some great frozen veggies out there these days it's one of the last bargains in the grocery store frozen vegetables and there's lots of organic brands down there something about making your own taste delicious you give this a stir move it around a little bit get it rendered out get o in people or not you chop Kesari off to the side do a nice big one in next nice sweet on potatoes you know lots of times for quick cooking I use those little baby potatoes because you don't have to peel them but for chowder I likes nice turkey fiddling Idaho potatoes it starts really helps thicken up the chowder for you and because I grew up on the Cape we who are eating a ton of scrog haddock and KY so that's what I'm gonna put in the soup today so nice having can't wait to eat this so happy all right kind of daydreaming about you know and at the end of the summer that's the first inkling you have when your head kind of goes back to comfort foods you know when it's super hot the dog days in the summer all you're thinking about our cold salad suppers ice cream crushing drinks arbic Ute burgers towards the end of summer that's we start thinking about your soups you chowder's stews or as I called Stoops fixed observable cinnamon soup excellent our Bacon's ready let's grab our food over here it's your onion celery down in there I don't put the potatoes in first because they're so starchy they stick to the bottom to soak up all the fat I put in the celery onions first so they can start giving off will their juices keep a nice moist oh heck I forgot my stop I gotta grab a container of stock and get that going this can be the stock and getting warm while the veggies and potatoes are cooking up so they're cooking out of simultaneously so that when you bring them together you're not slowing down with cooking process I'm gonna put a quarter stock in this pot before you could use seafood stock for the mellow flavor of chicken stock myself pop that on let that get warming up a couple potatoes here I get my herbs in now - I'm gonna throw in ice fresh bay leaf and a few sprigs of thyme I'm just going to throw the whole stem in because those little tiny leaves they'll fall off while the chowder's cooking up and we'll just fish the stems out later I'm gonna be at least potatoes up and get them and I'm going to start shucking the board I'll show you why I have two bowls just break that board off the cob right off your favorite shows and here for all new who networks are pretty just fries insanity ventures and larger like Everest positive networks on Sunday night in the life who never summer here you told JC

bunnies and I'm serving them up Italian Sandri don't wash with it understand my dream you roam here or you can prepare your grill get that cranked up now because I'm looking inside my boiler going to make my own ways to recommend you take a little bit off from story-wise roasted red peppers in a jar or you can turn the gas burner over open flame to blacken all over the room if you're cooking outdoors I love the grill most of us have a hot spot or keep cooking over coals you make a hot spot pulls back from the house for the grill closed lid I'm going to their charge I'm going to leave the boiler just a little bit my peppers in there so when I go back to get them in the chart up I don't get all that steam escaping kameena from the broiler into my face to really look to grab a couple of peppers you want to just got pop ready rather then the one that cracked a little bit I'm gonna grab my chicken thigh for you use boneless skinless chicken breast for this recipe I'm gonna grab you before the all-caps and fresh Rose Dijon mustard for our marinade also for a marinade and for the cook we grab some red wine dish spear dated pick that up going back here oh that's rings needs onions

range my mushrooms in this dish here or the rest of your no devil attack that course not gonna dance health indexes and weight down the mushrooms now count you doing in my family you can get those hunters Jeff pleased to make it with all skin on chicken shoot the chicken maybe with some salt for a little pancetta at wine tons of pressure pepper flakes and lots of wild mushrooms and a little tomato basically it a lot of Italian American restaurants especially serve up catching terrific peppers notice so in this dish we're going to marry up all the main ingredients in slow cooked chicken cacciatore in a quick cook big flavor any damage we've got peppers we have roasted peppers up on top but it throws the onions right out of the grill with her horn bellows I love for Adele especially gaster because they're so clean there's no person with painting when you're throw some chicken in there and we're even going to roast up some tomatoes on our Braille and kind of char them up let's squish Tomatoes up so it's really everything I love about get you cutting down the on Brett who doesn't love sandwich knife that doesn't need sandwiches don't have to be special these are beautiful so to wipe down and they're huge they don't have to keep up my marinade recipe a little bit you know what I think I'm gonna come back these are so big we put a half of a Portobello on each tin we do to four bucks save these for tomorrow take a beautiful broth or develops garlic delicious you seen Lee slice portobello mushrooms and then you combine them to not dance here Nixon basic slices you guys key thinly placed the Portobello strong combine it with sliced celery arts lots of flat leaf parsley and shaved parmigiano-reggiano and just dress the salad with lemon juice and olive oil salt delicious so that's going to do with it or having beautiful slices back okay now into the food processor we're going to combine gonna look why rosemary I'm basically just putting everything that I would put into my guests results red wine lots of garlic the peel of a couple of locals here and grate the garlic down in there with little hand writer or you can mince it on the county board reaction with a little salt you saw people fighting down a big piece of garlic and skin do these little held esters fantastic but it just turns it or I'll get you pay stones back so easy excellence couple of sprigs of rosemary this later of chicken thighs surface first half you can certainly switch this up the smallest unless you can rest if you're using size get six pieces of diplomas in the second time

ton of money publishing shows two from 30-minute meals to forty dollars a day do you think you think things are lost by spending less money and time on meals you think about money I I begin with the fact that my mother was one of ten children to me as the richest life of any human I've ever met our quality of life wasn't based on what was in their bank account it was how much time they spent together and then each person learned their value in the family one person was great the sewing and then they became the family seems trust her Taylor another person who's great at music they would be the entertainment dinner the you know the storyteller the Joker you know the beauty of large families which not many people laugh anymore is that you really can admire and see the difference in and everyone and the importance of them and I think in a you know beyond have fun drink Pepsi or as much money as fast as possible then keep it and they keep the way for everybody else and have smaller families and get more at all I think a little bit can be lost in there I would trade my passport for any on the planet I love being an American and all of the complications that comes with it but I think there's a big complication and always being the first or the best were getting to hear and not appreciating all of those hooks and crooks along the way and devaluing over time all of our jobs are important not just technology or what's going to happen tomorrow and medicine or science you know the next thing apples launching i miss growing up with people that admired stonemasons and shoemakers and tailors and poets you know I miss growing up around people had appreciated everything about each other and I think that we're coming back to that time because we've lived now for several years of everybody learning a new face to hunger everybody learning a new face to need everybody having neighbors that oh my god they were so successful and now where did they go they've left our neighborhood I think our face has changed a lot of the country and I think we're coming to know each other again and I think that's a great opportunity and most of talk radio and talk new shows every morning i watch them at the gym every day 545-6 i watch everybody from Fox MSNBC it's all about division you know this being the biggest division in our history and I actually see a little bit of the opposite of that I see around the edges we're starting to try and look for each other again each other and gave Meyer everyone's job and appreciate each other a little bit more money does not necessarily translate into quality sometimes by having less money makes you become more creative in quito my cats have food brought elation exception your ancestors from italy and stuff a lot of a lot of them didn't have a lot of money but some of the greatest food and stuff you don't necessarily need to have a lot of know i think i'll live well certainly everybody knows that they cover for movement but way before that and the last several decades in food have been about reinventing comfort food and you know all these cajones other hamburgers and risottos risotto is rice yeah pasta stuffed pasta and versatile a burger I mean people go back to comfort food because we're trying to get back to a different error maybe and again using foodies to cover I'm great handling other people's money I'm lousy in Italy my own i hate the stuff and i give it away as fasika i don't think that that means you have to give up being a good business person or a savvy marketing professional our yellow organization is a Children's initiative because they don't have children by Amin and quite frankly Don a time to Chile at them it was very important to me to be able to have an avenue for kids so I could see some kids going to school we don't have votech in public schools anymore we do not have the culinary programs there being a shop mechanic being a carpenter working in the food industry these all used to be available in public school when I was kid on 45 and you could have vocational training for anything in a school where we only have 50 for children in the graduating class you could graduate and go become a mechanic or a carpenter working in a restaurant or hotel you know a job you'd have a life you could be really proud of an honor decent living and that doesn't exist anymore home it doesn't even exist you know people can make dinner for themselves the lunch hour has gone down to 20 minutes very few children have recess most of them don't have a decent lunch many of them are not offered school breakfast anymore if they are it's an apple even that matters I spend a lot of my time lobbying just to get these things you know back into schools I want it to be able to send some kids to school because they didn't have mound and I wanted to be able to feed hungry kids because I make my living through food so we started our initiative that are three tiers one third of the money goes down relief one third goes to Lauren the obesity rate and getting families cooking one third goes to scholarship program for any public school child who wants to go to anything even remotely food elated so we started doing fundraisers and dinners things in like system make sense when you look at the net net net so we created product lines that would attract families to cook together and products that would get families together and gave all of my proceeds to that thing to fund make this greatly lunch so now we do that for him will leave too because my actual daughter is pimple
hey it's time to get cracking on my special soup for our big Thanksgiving feast mine has butternut squash carrots and oranges every which way that's why I call it hey orange I glad it's Thanksgiving soup mm-hmm I kill me all right this is a very simple soup and you don't have to make it just at Thanksgiving it's a good one for any cool day warms up from the inside out I'm starting by chopping up four carrots here this will make enough soup for six starter portions or you could get four entree portions out of it just run your knife through it and the small you chop your carrots of course the quicker they're going to cook up for you and this soup is a combination of fresh veggies and frozen veggies the butternut squash would take me the longest so I'm taking a little help from the store on that one I bought two boxes of puree that's gonna go into the soup I'm adding some evo Oh to coat the bottom of my soup pot and a generous pad of butter melt those two together and it'll let the butter come to a little higher cooking temp I put a little butter in there cause it adds a little sweetness to the soup nice creamy taste in the background gonna get my carrots in there and working run my knife through a small onion mmm smells good already yeah my mom is a riot she loves squash she especially loves butternut squash and she loves sweet potatoes too uh and she definitely loves pumpkins but if you bake any of those things up in the pie if you make a squash pie you know pumpkin pie or a or a sweet potato pie my mom eats out all this Center of the pie and refuses to eat the crust she is not satisfied with small portions of it either so I'm left with just a bunch of empty pie shells grumpy people that got gypped out of the pie and my mom um you know is happy and full of her squash so I thought hmm maybe I'll just move courses and do the squash as a soup he works out well then mom doesn't go out to go through all the trouble of eating out the pies so you let this cook together a few minutes then you hit it with the orange the orange flavor and the added extra orange color of a little pulpy orange juice now you can use half a cup of really pulpy orange juice that's ready to drink or you could use two big spoonfuls of orange juice concentrate from your freezer let that cook together and season it up with just a little salt and pepper excellent after a few minutes we'll look sort of like this over here this is just the cooked up carrots and onion I'm going to get this into the food processor so we can puree this The O'Jays sweeten this up nicely and that orange flavor has concentrated threw it away we go once you get it fairly smooth a little bit of weight left to it ain't bad which get it fairly smooth get it back into your soup pot easy cleanup on this one too let me tell you it's a neat trick hold on to the blade with your finger when you're scooping stuff back out of here you'll end up fishing your blade out of your soup pot then you're gonna just add some store-bought chicken stock there's no cream in this soup that's another really great reason I love it because I can eat bowls and bowls of it and not feel at all guilty about it it's very helpful store-bought chicken stock and two boxes right from the frozen food section of pureed butternut squash you know looks like this this size box two of these guys then you just combine that together see it's got a nice weight immediately but I just let it thicken up a touch let it go about ten minutes over a nice simmer and it looks like this and that looked great look at that oh that's just perfect and it smells delicious with the orange I'm gonna turn that off so we can get it ready to go mm-hmm now the finishing touch a little nutmeg boy that pot is a poppin I'm gonna put the lid back on it get it off the heat for a second there we go a little zip and nutmeg is the thing that's gonna make them go hmm what is that in there perfect garnishes for this a little fresh chevre some snipped chives some fresh thyme be delicious then no need to transfer this check it out just put the lid right back on top just going to wipe that up a bit and it's good to go I'm ready to hit the road and so is my soup when I get there I'm just gonna put this same pot right back on the stove over a very low flame until it's time to eat I told you it was easy right it's a winner and it works every time enjoy guys

in your opinion what city in the world and you can't say New York what city in the world has the best food well I would absolutely same here are my favorite ladies and the reason is one because I truly believe the entire world lives here I love I love visiting friends that live in Los Angeles I have to go to a few times here I love Rome it's a beautiful ancient city I I love a lot of cities on this planet i love the city my mother comes from this little tiny speck of a place jealous this look but all of the world lives in New York and you really can have any budget and be of any background and if you're in any other city there is one business or another that's predominant so the culture is led by one group of people or another I Love New York because there is every representation here at every price point I still love the dosa guy in washing and I love you know having a fifty-dollar veal parm car bomb you know i mean i love i love it all I I love being able to step back in time or move forward and I think New York definitely offers that more than any city I've been to but I haven't seen no bueno I mean for my it's not just because I'm a New Yorker but I'm very proud of New York State I'm very proud upstate New Yorker I love the outer on wax and it wouldn't trade where I come from for anything but I love that I get to share my time and the most comfortable place to eat for me he's New York City period it's the best green markets because of the great work Danny Meyer didn't totally almost single-handedly rebuilding the neighborhood I physically live in I'm surrounded by amazing restaurants and great farmers markets where you can buy seconds you can buy direct from the farmer you can still get bargains and food I live in a great rich food community and I told you before I show tonight even when I'm in upstate New York I take a lot of the farmers market from here and drive it home because unfortunately we can't get it there and that's not like Walmart and Target aren't a caring sustainable seafood it's not like the price chopper hasn't brought in local but we do not have so they've built the green market we just don't have the people living there to sustain you know folks to bring to this market and the small farmers they drive it all down stink you bring it all here it's not in my community I can't go to the lake luzerne green market on a Saturday doesn't exist it's just not there you know so my life is very much in marriage of the to another city that I'm a big big fan I was Austin they were agreeing before it was cool there are very special special group of people there's no ages in there there's no sexism you can see a man who's very clearly conservatively dressed fella sitting on a bus with his dog and talking to a kid with gauges in his ears and I love that I love being in a community that feels that familiar and it being in Texas I think that's real special and they have food trucks and small businesses celebrated in that whole self come Chris district I I love starbucks i love Walmart alip dark I love what everybody does for our economy in different ways but I do like a place like Austin where there's a few blocks where it's still about independent business and the American spirit and that whole kind of everybody's okay here and everybody belongs I mean we're a country of kicked out from every place and then we became these forerunners in a lot of ways I like a place that mixes those two ideas and I think Austin is another big place

now if you're a vegetarian or you have one in your life it's a good idea to arm yourself with some meals that are meat free but hard enough for everyone to share I'm going to start by filling up a pot with some water for the penne pasta and out of the fridge let's grab the three vegetables I'm gonna use haricot vert those are just thin green beans and about a half a pound of asparagus half a bundle and a medium zucchini that's a little guy in me and I'm gonna grab my pine nuts as well I keep them in the fridge so that I can get the longest life out of them pine nuts are filled with oils and if you keep them to warm the oils can go rancid and spoil the nuts you get a nice long life out of them keeping them in the fridge or the freezer I'm gonna just cover the bottom of a skillet here with them I love pine nuts because they're nice and buttery and extra delicious and as with any nut you're gonna get the most flavor out of them if you toast them up a bit before you use them that allows the oils to come out and really deepen the flavor of them I'd say we got a couple of handfuls in there we're gonna make a pesto sauce so I always put pine nuts in my pesto delicious everybody puts pine nuts in their pesto right classic basil pesto genovese well today is kind of a take-off on that we're gonna do a combo a basil and tarragon which I think are very related in taste they're both kind of sweet licorice ange it's delicious now I'm gonna put a lid on our pasta pot there so the water comes up to a boil quicker now let's start talking about the veggies here let's start with haricots vert I reco vert that's just French for green beans and they're very skinny and delicate just pretty in this recipe all right I'm gonna pile up all these ends together here I think I could do this last bunch in one swoop I don't want to leave them straight you know a few stragglers here there we go last bundle it's a little bit time-consuming but if you take the time to pile them all together it makes the trimming so much easier done garbage bold that now these are already you know not too long not too big so I'm just gonna make one cut down the middle of the whole pile and that'll be about the size of the shape of the penny well pile that off to the side we'll end up putting them all into the green bean bag there so one medium zucchini it's not too fleshy in the middle here's what I'm gonna do cut off the ends and then cut them into strips and then take my strips cut those into sticks and cut the sticks across into little penny sized pieces now the asparagus this is half a pound I had some as a side dish the other night but you remember how to trim it right these guys are already trimmed but you just hold it at both ends give it a little snap and wherever it breaks that's your guideline for where to cut the asparagus once you get all the nice tender tops together line them up in a row you might want to cut these at a bit of an angle sort of like pen a is the name for the quills of a pen and that's the pasta we're using and they're cut on kind of an angle so you just want to cut those on an angle as well right down there and we're just gonna pile them all up here together let's gather up some more ingredients and get our pesto sauce made I'm gonna grab a big bag full of herbs I've already got prepped and ready to go I'm gonna grab a celery heart a nice big piece of parmigiano-reggiano really yummy and I'm gonna grab some portobello mushroom caps I'm gonna need one lemon for our pesto and some garlic this is such a nice easy pesto but once you learn the method of making a pesto n-- you've probably already made them at home but it's so much fun to experiment with the ingredients you could make an artichoke heart pesto you could make spinach pesto you can change up the nuts you could change up all the different herbs that you use so this is just a nice variation on a theme let's say let's start with the herbs let's talk about these first I think this is a nice complement here now basil that's gonna be our primary if you've made pesto genovese or your basic pesto at home before you've worked with this right you just get the nice leafy tops all together I find about 20 leaves or so makes about a cup we want about a cup of basil leaves in there maybe a couple more excellent and then I'm gonna add some nice licorice in there the licorice flavor is gonna come from fresh tarragon I love the sweet liqueur she tasted it and I think it's just such a nice pair to the basil basil is super sweet to me so the licorice she leaves of the fresh tarragon make a nice companion a nice buddy I'm gonna do well maybe five or six sprigs of that in there now these are very tender see this how this tarragon is you know kind of wilting over like that that's because it's very young and tender but usually the stems are pretty woody so I try and pull the leaves off as gently as possible and just get the leaves in there not the stems parsley our next ingredient here well it's easy to go ahead and use up a little bit of the stems in here that's fine parsley stems have a nice bright flavor just like the tops and I'm gonna reserve some of my flat leaf parsley here that's from my salad that we're gonna make in a minute I'm gonna take the rest gather up the stems to the bottom but you know have to be too careful about it it's a great use for the stems actually now I always put parsley into just about any pasture I make you know why cuz it helps the pesto keep a nice bright green color to it okay so let's get that off to the side plus it's got a great flavor right I'm gonna zest a lemon in here next I think the citrusy action with the licorice she flavors and the sweet basil just really works together quite nicely and it turns this into a sort of a four-season dish this is an excellent dish even in the summer although I would recommend serving it cold rather than hot now we're gonna get one clove of garlic in there we'll just pop it and drop it boom pull the skins off throw those in the old garbage bowl and goes the garlic let's do a little bit of salt and pepper next and then I've got a nice big piece of parmigiano-reggiano not parmesan Parmesan si n that's domestic cheese it's made to taste like Carmen gently Reggiano but I think Parma jog parmigiano-reggiano is such an important ingredient especially when you're making something like a pesto get the real deal you know this is aged at least eighteen months and it has a really nutty wonderful aroma and flavor to it I'm just going to grab a grater here just put it right over the top and you want the equivalent of a couple of handfuls just grate away in there and then we're good to go we're just gonna turn it on and stream in our Evo Oh our pine nuts of course we gotta get those with it right all right okay almost there we can always add more cheese to it later too as we're tossing it all together yep we got a little heat off the nuts let's put those in there we're good to go pop it on let her rip and then stream in your evo Oh your extra-virgin olive oil until it's a consistency you like I like a nice thick pesto cuz I add a little bit of the cooking liquid right before I mix the pasta and the pesto together so we're good there once the pastas going a couple minutes guys you can drop your whole collection of vegetables right into the same cooking water it's so cool this is an easy cleanup meal great for vegetarians or meat eaters it's awesome and you know you could even serve this speaking of a nice summer meal you could serve this cold in the summer months I'm gonna take out a little bit of this starchy cooking liquid here when I got a little piece of zucchini there but that's okay I'm going to add this to my pesto now the pesto remember was a mixture of basil and tarragon and flat leaf parsley with your usual suspects the garlic and the cheese and the pine nuts and the olive oil now I'm turning it into a nice sauce here by adding a little bit of that hot cooking liquid it thins it out a little and the starchy liquid helps it stick right to the pasta now I cooked the veggies my combination of asparagus and haricot vert those thin green beans and zucchini all in the same pot I started the penne first whoo remember to get penne with lines penne Rigate the lines help oil based sauces stick to the pasta better so now I'm gonna drain off the veggies and the pasta you start the pasta first then a few minutes into the cooking process you add the veggies you want to pull the veggies when they still have a nice bite bright color and a good bite to them just like you want a good bite to the pasta al dente pasta give that a good drain you don't want too much liquid in with our sauce and then we'll dump it right back into our dish here let's make sure we can still toss it I still have a little bit extra here I want to make sure we can toss it I'm gonna get a few more veggies in there now if you're watching your car - whether you eat meat or don't eat meat this is a great meal for you because there's tons of vegetables and a little bit of pasta all mixed up together in a really healthy tasty sauce oh look at that the colors and the fragrance remember you could use this terrific pesto if you do eat meat on top of meats as well you could make some nice grilled chicken or fish and put the pesto down over the top be delicious in the summer you could serve this as a cold pasta salad or even a cold pesto potato salad as well nice I think that's fine
with images truly want to talk with you sandwich Caroline of our few upper is sweet potato fries / turkey guys welcome back i'm working on a meal to celebrate the flavors at the end of summer which you can make it all year long anytime you want my fish and corn chowder well if you're working with fresh corn on the cob may need three years for this lot of geography four to six people I'm going to scrape down the corn on a small bowl sitting upside down in the bottom of a larger bowl that's so that as you sprayed the corn all the liquids and all the kernels are captured by the large hole it's the least messy way to do a really kind of fun job if you're making this out of season you're going to need about twice a two and a half three cups of frozen kernels or you could do what my friends and I trying to remind ourselves to do the recipe and again in the summer so if we have the corn for the rest of year make up a bunch of corn no Bree and I'll boil it up scrape it down throw it in the freezer and you can cook with it for months over here I had a lid on my chowder I kind of force the veggies along a little bit they're getting nice and tender at the same time my vegetables were slumping up a bit giving up their juice I was heating up some chicken stock so i can add that down in and it doesn't slow up the cooking process I've got one quarter stock you can use chicken or seafood and it's nice and hot already up to a boil not slowing anything down i'm giving a good stir to release all of the drippings at the bottom of the band from our bacon and onions a little bit of garlic they time and I chopped up those too starchy potatoes through Roman here got some celery in there as well put the celery and onion in first so we can sweat out a little and the potatoes will suck up all the drippings from the bacon too quickly X throw our corn in there the corner chill it out a little bit so immediately I'm gonna pop the lid right back on so it's screaming hot for the heck gonna put the attic in the chanukah cook up a few minutes like five minutes or so and then we're going to stir it some milk and cream to really help me that that were just picking it up I have two bounds have had a fillet here or you can do Scott hope I need my cheese too i want to get going on my grilled cheeses means i need my butter as well i'm going to show you a neat trick but to show you the neat trick for the grilled cheese on english muffins we're going to be making you gotta soften up your butter spread of these ten seconds for a stick-on do you grab my english muffins deal with that in a minute almost got up to a boil there with you in a second butter it's a beautiful haddock you want skin off nice white flaky fish whatever looks good if they destroy that day now you just might use tongs here just gently set this endeavor not to cut it up or anything or break it up once the fish becomes opaque and coach through that one back on yes let me show you how we assemble grilled cheese samples there's something so awful American just fun about any sandwich you serve about an Englishwoman just kind of ironic because of the name of the month English I grabbed the butter I'm going to slice some super sharp cheddar sometimes it crumbles up on you no big deal and let me roadmap this for you so how to take another quick break here in this cheese I got to be slow and careful I do have the brick to come back to it over the break so get your cheese all sliced up your extra sharp cheddar I take your English muffins split them turn them inside out so all of the nooks and crannies are facing out and then you're going to butter them before you put them on the griddle then the butter is evenly distributed on both sides of the grilled cheese is then that really other

gonna do oh yes I would oh you seriously won't get Rachel write it up we have to die my dad no really don't want to hurt myself okay welcome to cooking with rednecks and today we're making Fettuccine Alfredo hesitate fettuccine alfredo dollar index one pound of pasta have found a grated parmesan happen how to butter and a cup of milk absolutely never margarine margarine in this recipe does not work it gets all oily and my close to the top and it doesn't mix with teeth okay it's a really simple process burney age 36 butter because we're going to make a recipe and a half tonight so it's actually going to be a pound and a half of pasta three-quarters of a pound of cheese and three-quarters of a pound of butter and a cup and a half of milk the milk you may need to adjust by as much as two or three tablespoons just depending on how creamy like your saucer if you wanted to really stick your process the one thing they will say is we're going to boil the pasta in this pot and then use the same hot pot to make the sauce so that we can make the sauce right on the pasta because the Potter if you clap it will melt the butter and cheese much quickly than if we were to make the sauce and its own cock separately and later let over the top yeah almost like that early and cheese only we don't have to bake it after we make sauce and pasta um right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to butter up some of this garlic bread and if I can figure out where i sat down the garlic salt I would be a much happier person got a little green and on the table besides it has parsley in it he wanted to buy the pre-made frozen garlic oh this is anil semi-homemade with sandra lee i'm making awful on fresh made real garlic red run over semi-homemade ebooks and early pretty much yeah but anyway hi welcome back right now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and put five minutes in spaghetti into the water as you can see it's hot white women but we've got a lot of bubbles on the bottom and putting across hand is going to cool it right back down again anyway just because we're putting a cool solid into a hot liquid so just to you know not worry about defying physics or could burn my hands we're going to go ahead and put all this in there now especially so we're doing this double back Justin this is Chloe four ounces top ten that's ten and a half also apparently supporting the susan g komen for the Cure Foundation I don't know why I mean obviously it's not that I problem with breast cancer just don't know why it's in my pasta right pasta in the water and normally I would tell you always be sure double check the cook time on the back of your positive one since it says right here five minutes been thin spaghetti everyone gets a time is cross the oven should be preheated so we're going to go ahead and sprinkle our garlic and what to Patricia do you it should be at 450 we're doing it for 25 can I understand that the sevenths most for 50 years idea you want to make sure that you get a good shot of garlic on each piece Walker can people like garlic has done this alone especially because it's garlic salt salt garlic sugar parsley garlic oil its marital carrot oil for color okay Boston is doing its little cost anything we're going to give this lecture boys best to watch your pasta starts you know coming back up to a bubble sort of helped it along in the boiling process yes you're stirring some cool air into the water there but by praying up the pasta to sort of move around the pot as it sees fit it's going to cook more evenly and it's not gonna stick together as bad okay come on put this garlic right into the 425-degree oven our pastas ready as you can see it's doubled in volume that's why we needed the larger pot I mean can you see this massive spaghetti fitting in that tiny little pot we had before so as you can see this was a great professor meant to have a really good pasta pot so what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and strain the pasta now if you were making a cold pasta salad or if for example you wanted to you know eat your pasta and just put cold tomato sauce out the fridge on it touch of butter anything of that nature we're gonna run some cold water over it stop the cooking process and make it stay where it is so it doesn't get any softer but we're not going to do that because we want it to stay high I've cooked it a little harder than al dente like it's not quite done yet because we're going to put it back into the hot sauce and it's going to cook some more you in our butter first and remember we're making a one and a half times recipe tonight certainly use three sticks of butter that's three quarters out of town again the last two days on the fridge some are butters starting to melt this is much easier done on the stove that's actually levelled your stove lean that way okay you can buy a wedge of parmesan and shred your own if you're picky about brand or you feel like fresh cheese like the little wedges of fresh taste better I'm lazy I'm a semi homemade on the cheese mostly because it takes so long to shred it you don't know time properly and beer garlic bread um one thing I will say is that that if you do buy these free shredded cheeses don't waste a lot of time and money trying to figure out which brand is going to taste of us if you're going to go to the ziplock bag of cheese go for cheap don't go with quality the whole point is to just get the cheese in the sauce no salt pepper and garlic your sauce to your heart's content now you're going to want to keep a pretty consistent search this was not helping the way I wanted it to and to so I turned it back up to four you were real close eye on dairy products on the skills though you stole them there's no getting it back contact us out this is looking great it should look kind of like cream cheese like that sort of thickness nice and melty are kind of watery more for me I was actually thinking like potato soup cream of potato soup when the cheese is kind of melted into the butter and the milk and there's one thing there's not like a blob of cheese that you're moving around as you start then it's ready for the pasta so and I turned it back down all the way to 22 and a half after I got the cheese pretty good melty we're going to leave the heat on we're going to pour back in articles hey see we are going to shift back into our noble for is a shelf but you get the general I so you're going to want to push the pasta through the sauce so that I get evenly coated throughout and so that that cheese that's not quite well to get can really stick to the pasta white sauce at the bottom of the pan okay guys we have absolutely alfredo pasta ready to eat No happy birthday to you have a birth way rescate it and

hi this is rachael ray you may know me from 30-minute meals or food travels well i'm here with a new show for people who just don't have time for 30-minute meals it's rachel ray this is two to five minute meals due to food okay okay today we're going to be making cupcakes and this is a dish that my mom always used to make you want to start with a bowl okay now yeah okay first thing you want to do is you want to put down your base which for this we're making a nice vanilla cupcake you want your base to be really flavorful and really bring out the spices of the dish so we're going to start with garlic salt I'm going to put some in here okay now we're going to whip that up I remember when I was a kid my grandpa used to used to take me fishing right before we made cupcakes and that was one of the best experiences of my life it was so nice I know yeah I used to joke you know that um that we put the fish in the cupcakes well for these cupcakes we are really going to put in fish I started doing this after shortly after my grandpa died and actually tastes really good so for this we just want one two three whoa and just pick that up it's for God made dirt and dirt don't hurt you know what they say okay um all right this is going to be one of our longer meals pushing towards five minutes because they have to bake so next we're going to add a little bit of evo oh that's extra virgin olive oil just going to put that in okay now we're going to wait for 10 seconds while it sits and while you do this I like to kind of prepare the other ingredients right now the next ingredient we're going to be adding is our liberate tablets they they have a really nutty flavor almost like an almond and it just it really brings out the natural vanilla taste in these cupcakes and it's great for alcoholics I would suggest in one bottle if you don't drink and to view delivery tablets you can find them pretty much anywhere okay that's done sitting we're going to add our tablets okay okay we go the little little gray thing yes okay and once you've done that you want stir it gently but be careful because you don't want it to get too fluffy because that will damage it um Evie LOL that's extra virgin olive oil next we're going to add some carrot juice make sure you shake it this is really going to pull this all together right now we have a lot of the dry ingredients but what we really need is something to pull it all together and that is carrot juice we're just going to add some in okay there we go this is looking really great all right stir this up now finally we're just going to add a little flour here because it's our that sugar sugar or flour it's about the same thing either get it sweet or you'll get um really moldable cupcakes they're both good things so either one works now we're going to stir it mmm we're going to insta bake it like this okay insta baked this reminds me of this one time when I was out hunting and I actually we're just going to wait for Tim fake and I caught this wild deer and I was so hungry that day that I just ate it I right there i just ate the deer by um my bare hands okay now this is done insta baking and cupcake yeah just like my mom used to make so this has been to 25 minute meals with Rachael Ray happy cooking goodbye
hey welcome back to 30 Minute Meals I'm Rachael Ray and today I'm using my entree as a passport a passport in Venice I'm starting my Venetian scallops and shrimp and look at the color look at the color these have been in the pan just two minutes with I've been cooking less than ten and look at this look at the color we've got that's all sugar coming out of those scallops they are just gorgeous I'm going to turn them rather quick and I'm going to let this guy go just one minute because I don't want them to cook all the way through and you don't want to overcook your scallops I don't need that I need my wine and I need my saffron that's one of my surprise ingredients in the sauce a little chicken stock and tomatoes and we're good to go myself little room to move here okay now as I said I'm just gonna let those go one minute so I want them out onto a plate I'm going to slide them back into the sauce later and let them just finish at the end those are gorgeous plus they're still warm they're continuing to cook right now take it over the color smells so great in here okay so all we had in there was a little olive oil and butter I'm going to add a touch more olive oil a little crushed red pepper flake for heat give it a little pop in the palm of my hand and we've got our garlic and shallots all ready to go smells wonderful touch more EVO Oh on that extra virgin olive oil look at all those good pan drippings - we're going to get those up with our wine nice wooden spoon here oh so fragrant okay now I'm going to get all those good bits up by adding a little liquid now use good wine why do you actually want to drink out of a glass because when you're cooking with wine you're concentrating that flavor I got about a cup in there I'm just gonna let that reduce by half which will take no time what side smelling great and this is a lot more affordable you know buying some good seafood a lot more affordable than getting on an airplane although I am gonna get on an airplane later this year me and mom are actually gonna go to Venice I'm so excited I really want to see what she saw when she was a girl what kept her up all night you know the canals and fireworks we're gonna go during the big regatta in the boat race Shino theme nights like this you can go there any day of the week I put on little music open a little wine and it's fun it's like you're a little kid again you know you get to pretend and play for the night great it's a good idea okay now I'm just going to add one small can of diced tomatoes it's a couple of cups ooh yummy and little chicken stock cup of that and now the secret ingredient remember how I was telling you that Venice is a spice port well this is saffron and in Venice you get saffron you get curry you get all these interesting spices mixed in with the base which is always tomato and wine and garlic so with the expected you get the unexpected now a little goes a long way with saffron you just want to put a pinch in there it's actually the stamens of a flower ooh so fragrant wonderful and that's going to be the really interesting backdrop flavor in there that's what makes this Venetian perfect hey the waters ready for the asparagus yeah perfect let's come up to a nice simmer and this is a classy little side dish that takes no effort asparagus and prosciutto okay now let me show you how you know where to break your asparagus I leave these on I give these Fergus to rinse and leave these on keeps them all together and easier to cut how do you know where to cut take your asparagus and let it tell you just give it a gentle push and it'll say okay right about there see just hold it from either end give it a little pop and that's how you know where to cut now I'm just going to go right down the line and I just save those scraps there's a couple of veggies I like to save the trimmings up like mushrooms and my asparagus they're terrific for soup okay now these are only going to be in here a couple of minutes you want them to keep their color you just need them nice and tender ooh the sauce is ready I got to take a quick break but I'm just going to get the shrimp into the sauce and let it cook nice and gentle okay welcome back to 30 minute meals today I'm making a meal straight off the boat from Venice I guess I should say straight off the gondola the asparagus is just perfect that's for my asparagus wrapped with prosciutto it was only in there about two minutes so it's still got all of its color it's gorgeous I'm spreading it out on that plate so it cools really quickly and in less than 20 minutes I've already got my sauce completed with tomatoes wine saffron shallots and garlic really delish the shrimp's in there cooking right now the scallops are already cooked well pretty much almost all the way through I didn't want to finish them off because they're going back in but look at all of the sugar that came out during the cooking process remember we got our pan really hot we just used a little flour to edge that whole thing along now I'm zesting a lemon real quick here and I'm just going to leave a little bit of lemon zest off to the side of my board because I'm going to layer that flavor into my Venetian shrimp and scallops later I'm also going to use up the whole of the lemon because I want to get a little of that on the asparagus just to drizzle I always juice this side up so the seeds don't go in the dish a little drizzle of evo Oh extra virgin olive oil and a little salt and pepper now I'm doing all this to these Farragut's first because I'm going to wrap it with micro judo and I don't want to put the lemon juice on top of the prosciutto it will discolor it now I'm going to streamline the process of this here by just setting up everything in a line so I'm going to do probably let's say I probably got enough for at least five of these little bundles here so I'll put five pieces of my Persian bow down it's so nice you can get prosciutto de Parma right in the regular grocery stores now and at a terrific price okay now exactly the same thing make five little bundles of asparagus now remember I said this was fun for cocktail parties too you could individually wrap these and people can just pick them up and it's a a wonderful utensil free healthy snap look at that isn't that cool now I just rock and roll and wrap and roll there we go one two three see it goes much easier if you're just doing the same action over and over again cool man we're done with that let me just grab a plate I think it'll look nice on there you know even if you're cooking for yourself take the time to make it pretty you know set these for your eyes first in your stomach second and that's what's neat about these little getaway nights these passport nights you know you can really treat yourself then it's very inexpensive you buy a couple special ingredients take a little extra time with your food and hey all you got to commit to is half an hour right everybody's got 30 minutes somewhere in there okay woo my meant to say and really use me oh this smells so good nice fresh basil that's to finish off our shrimp and scallops look at the holes on blackberries and raspberries I couldn't decide between the two so I got them both and I've got some lemon sorbet in here I really want that to come to room temperature so it's easier to scoop so I'm just going to put that out now get it out of the way oh it smells fantastic now let me show you this is kind of cool I'm just going to pile up a few of these leaves here oh you know what I don't want that shrimp to go too far and they're starting to curl up when the tail goes towards the end here when it starts to make that shape that's a and hey I'm almost done so I'm going to slide my scallops right back into the pan so they can finish off very gently combine that sprinkle in that lemon zest there's another layer of flavor going on and just let that hang out and cook very gently the last couple of minutes oh it's gorgeous now for color and sweetness to balance the heat that I put in there with that crushed red pepper flake and to really offset that beautiful saffron I'm going to get a little basil going watch this you just pile the leaves together make a little
okay I told you we'd be whipping up some of my favorite dishes so we're going to start with a spicy shrimp and spaghetti Aglio olio we want to grab some water feed pot of water for our pasta we're going to go ahead and start with cold water we have time for it to come to a boil and we want to give ourselves time because the meal can be moving forward and we can be working on a lot of other stuff that's good let's get it on the stove okay put that on high forget about it now we need one of our stars for the day shrimp big jumbo shrimp and they're easy peel tell you what that means what it means is it's already been deveined all you have to do is slide off the skin done totally done put it aside now if they don't have easy peels no big deal take a really sharp knife and just run it down the back and you're gonna devein the shrimp okay I'm going to get the pan nice and hot for our shrimp because we're going to cook these really quick and it's extremely important that the pan be hot you want to sear in the flavor keep them tasting crisp and fresh and very sweet so I'm going to let that start working and I'm going to grab a couple of more ingredients for this we need some lemon and garlic my absolute favorite ingredient in the pantry yeah I need a little crushed red pepper for some heat this is the microplane you can get these just about everywhere and there's so much fun they work even better if you turn them around there's so much fun because they take the zest right off and it doesn't get stuck on the back it just slides right off you just want to take the zest of the lemon it's gonna bring home that lemon flavor make that seafood taste really fresh catch you don't want the white just take a little of the yellow that's where all the flavor is all of the oils in the lemon great give it a little shake now he's got this lemon in its peeled you might as well use it right yet the juices flowing in there roll it make sure the lemons ready to give up its juices a quick split I like to squeeze the lemons this side up so that the pits stay in and you don't have to bother with the cheesecloth thing you know where you put the cheese cloth and wrap it around I don't have time for that I really don't I have no patience is the problem so I just give it a quick squeeze like that great we have this parsley that we already chopped remember we were going to use it in everything so we chopped it once and left a big pile we're gonna sprinkle a little bit of that in again it's gonna freshen that flavor grab a little side tale here start working with our garlic garlic I just love it it comes out of your pores so of course I always end up smelling like a salami but it's so worth it it's a big flavor and it just gets sweet when you cook with it and it just makes the house smell like home to me now we're gonna give this a quick chop run the knife over it just keep gathering it up o our water steaming it's almost ready for our pasta and our pan is getting nice and hot I can see it start to smoke that's a good thing not a bad thing just means it's ready okay now we're going to take a little bit of this garlic add it to our shrimp it's going to make it so easy because we're putting all the ingredients for our spicy shrimp right on the shrimp a little crushed red pepper now I like to take it and just give it a crush in the palm of my hand to get the oils out and release all the heat that's going to give it our zip then we're going to give it a drizzle of the extra-virgin olive oil beautiful a little bit of pepper black pepper and red pepper two different heats they react differently in different spots on your tongues you can use both over the shoulder for luck quick toss with this get all of your ingredients in that well it's a quick marinade I guess right over your shrimp equally distribute all those flavor factors now we've got a nice big skillet here because we're going to do our pasta in the same Hanne but you don't want to put all the shrimp in even though it would fit you want this to cook quick sear in the juices so you want to cook it in two batches give it space if you put all this in the pan it's gonna suck all the heat right out of it will heat vampire and it's not gonna work out good you're gonna have a totally different texture with that shrimp I'm gonna grab a plate because when that batch is ready I want to be ready for it keep the plate right next to your pop let's get our pasta in because our water is boiling we want about a pound of pasta now the thing to remember about your pasta when you get it in there whoops is to stay with it until the water takes it so the water takes it all work it just for a minute until the pasta is completely submerged you get a nice facial while you're here and added little bonus we cooked our spicy shrimp in two batches because we wanted the heat in the pan to be the same for all the shrimp you put them all in there sucks the heat right out they look gorgeous they're going to be sweet and crisp and spicy now we're going to use this very same pan to make our pasta sauce but it's at a totally different heat level so we're going to pull the pan off to the side let it cool down a bit and drop our heat source right down to low right down to simmer we've got some reserved garlic for our sauce and we need some anchovies anchovies taste completely different when you add some heat it's not like anchovies on a pizza you're not going to have a strong fishy taste just stay with me on this it's gonna work out I got a little bit of garlic left in the pan here just gonna get that out of there the flavor from the seafood is fine but you don't want a flavor of singed garlic it's very bitter so if you have to if you've got little pieces of garlic left get rid of them okay now this is cooled down a bit we've dropped this down to a simmer put this right back on here I'm going to stir our pasta we've got some spaghetti in there and it's almost done so we're gonna quick with our sauce here we're gonna add evo oh that's the base for this extra-virgin olive oil go nuts with it it's a good fat it's not going to hurt you it's not going to clog any arteries it's gonna keep you young and healthy and boy your skin will be just gorgeous okay very generous with that that's the base at all of the garlic it's gonna get sweet and mellow you're gonna love it don't worry about it get it all in there two people that have garlic breath cancel each other out so don't worry about it from that angle either okay beautiful this is gonna simmer it's gonna speak it's gonna go add something to me we're gonna include a little bit of heat crushed red garlic rub it in your hand get the oils going released Oh crushed red pepper sorry release the heat get it in there with your garlic and the garlic and the crushed red pepper together they're gonna both infuse the oil with lots of flavor now we got a little fishies are anchovies I usually put in two per person even if you don't care for the taste of anchovies please try this just once because what happens is once you get the anchovies in there they break up they melt they become a natural salt flavor and they taste more nutty than fishy no kidding okay now what's going to happen with these is they're just going to break up you're not going to be able to see them they're going to just melt away into the sauce it'll be like magic who doesn't like a little magic with your supper I'm going to let those hang out and start to melt away I'm gonna get that pasta out while it's still nice and al dente to the teeth whoo another one of them facials okay you don't want a cold shock or stop the cooking process with the pasta you want it to stay nice and hot so you're just gonna give it a really good shake careful when you transfer it you don't want to burn yourself so have a towel handy let's turn off our stove keep this right here waiting for our sauce let's work with these see they're starting to melt away it smells like home it just makes me so happy every time I make this meal oh it just brings us all together you know it's always on the table oh yeah oh yeah garlic and oil it's just a basic in our house okay we're gonna add the pasta to the sauce and toss it all together cuz you want all the macaroni to taste good every kind of pasta in our house was called macaroni okay now we're gonna add a little bit of that parsley remember we chopped it for everything all at one time it's waiting for us it's gonna freshen and brighten the flavor of our macaroni and it's gonna add a little bit of color this is so perfect I wish you could smell this it's just fragrant not a warm cozy delicious ah it's a meal before you ever hit the fork to the plate we've got our spaghetti call alia Alia all done here that's garlic and oil it's got a little heat in there with the crushed red pepper tons of garlic and anchovies but we don't taste them they taste nutty and salty they don't taste fishy at all don't leave any of that flavor in the pan get it all out and on top of your macaroni done fantastic okay we've got our tomato and onion salad we've got our spaghetti Canali oh love you and we have our fantastic spicy shrimp beautiful
I'm going to heat a big skillet over medium heat and put in about a half inch of olive oil to fry it in that's called a shallow fry this is nice fresh thyme the trip to the tenders well there's a couple of tricks to them you put cheese grated cheese all through the breadcrumbs and lots of nice fresh herbs and this time you just hold the stem at the top gently pull backwards and the leaves just come right off and they're so small you don't even need to chop them a few sprigs of that and you're ready to go just pop those in the pie plate there rosemary you take the leaves off the same way but you do need to chop those up a little because you don't want big pieces of rosemary getting stuck in everybody's teeth you just hold the stem of the top pull nice and gentle all of those really fragrant woodsy leaves will come off just give it a quick chop nice and fine keep your fingers curled under there I don't want to put any of those in your chicken tenders okay pop that in the bowl a little bit of flat-leaf parsley now whenever I bring my produce home I do a one big shopping week bring the produce home I give it all a wash and a dry then I wrap it in paper towels keep the moisture away from the greens put it in food storage bags and then it's ready to use all week long good little time-saver there the flat leaf parsley is a little peppery err than the curly but you can use whichever one you prefer give that a quick chop put your herbs in the dish four cloves of garlic go in there that we reserved I've got three cloves in with my owner remember I needed it twice so I chopped it once I popped the first three cloves in with my onion there it's sauteing gently can unwrap well you know what before I even touch those chicken fingers let's finish our breadcrumb you want two cups of Italian bread crumb that's about one that's about two and one full cup of grated cheese I use parmigiano-reggiano because it's so yummy and nutty tasting get it already fresh grated just hand them a hunk and they hand me back a nice pile of grated parm just mix that together real quick with your fingertips and you're ready to go with garlicky cheesy breading there now your eggs go in your center dish two of those in there and then look real quick with a fork great first one just gets plain old flour about a cup of that now we're ready to make our assembly line chicken tenders just pull your wrapper off little salt and pepper on those guys okay now they're ready to go into the flour quick dredge you just shake off your extra flour then they're going to go into the egg now the breading's got a couple of secret ingredients going on it's got lots of grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese in there and tons of fresh herbs the time the rosemary the parsley little crushed red pepper flake and the Italian breadcrumbs and we just go flour egg crumbs and right into the hot oil now I'm just shallow frying these I'm just browning the outside that I'm transferring to the hot oven which we preheated at about 350 see there they browned super quick on the second side enough for a big platter full and they'll finish off in just a few minutes in the oven I'll turn that oil right off pop these in the oven oh yeah hey get nice and brown because I put parmigiano cheese all through the bread crumb lots of nice fresh herbs they are definitely a crowd-pleaser and because you just shallow fry them and then you finish them in the oven they're only in the frying pan actually for a couple minutes and if you want you can just keep transferring them straight to the oven so some are already cooking and there's batches all coming out say you had to cook for a huge crowd say your gangs up over four or five people then you'd want to do it that way just keep running them back and forth into your oven there but isn't that gorgeous huh doesn't need a thing
Monday's they can be tough at work but surprisingly with shows like 24 and heroes on television it's an ideal night for friends to come over and have dinner my friends are cooked for me many times and unfortunately this day it is my time to cook dinner I only have one problem with that I'm just too damn lazy to cook dinner for anybody that's why I call this the real deal 30 minute meal you know you have Rachel rated her 30 minute meals that's true that have you ever really tried to make that 30 minute meal what do you have to do first of all you got to catch the show which is 30 minutes already you got to record that show and write everything down the store fight the traffic fight the lines of sort of bring on the food home cut it all up put it in nice little pretty Bowl and then by all the time you everything's all produced and laid out for you like it is on the show yeah it takes about 30 minutes but what's the real time two days so this is why I kind of put this little video to show people what they can do when it's their time to cook meal for their friends with everybody watching their weight these days you can't go to McDonald's and you can't go order out takeout Chinese phone they want to see the love and the hardship and the good values putting a strong meal at home so let me show you my 30 minute real deal first it starts with TV dinners if you see I bought marie callender's because marie callender's is known for their TV dinners which are tasty but also yet good for you they don't have to worry about 230 calories from fat saturated that's not really important is they're not going to know anyways so you start with the TV dinners the next thing you do is you got to get some tools to help make your meal look authentic did you really cook it how are they going to know what's going to really show them what I like to do is get one of my favorite pieces is corn on cob delicious frozen already pre-cut already taking this whatever the leaves are feeling not a cook I just know you put that in hot water and it gets done in about 5-10 minutes you get some bread cut and butter this put a little spice on it but some reason people feel like you really made a meal with these two things on the side and then the last thing you want to do this really tops all up like the icing on the cake good old parsley knife that a couple times put it on your plate and you're good to go people think it's funny and cute he made a meal for us and he put parsley on it too oh god this is going to be fun 30 minute real deal here we go okay now this is step two I have all the ingredients on the tables ready to go I'm pretty sure I already covered the fact that i am quite lazy but how lazy am I still lazy in fact that after I went out and bought TV dinners for my friend and I'm going to get my girlfriend that microwave them for me go ahead good no I don't know microwave them no babe you got to take the cardboard off I'm pretty sure no baby take the cardboard off get in a cola Micah they're taking them okay so here's the finished product we got ourselves hey Stevie dinner that's all the way cooked now see obviously you can't serve the dinner like this but it's an easy fix all you basically need is some sort of ceramic plate now from here to here for some reason this dinner starts to look a whole hell of a lot better first we take the chicken and we put it on the side there look at that I just cook that chicken Wow I'm a genius take the other piece of chicken go ahead and put it right there man I'm a culinary expert now we got some juices there that I can trickle on top of the chicken but you don't want to do that yet because it might look just a little bit nasty so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my hands I'm just going to grab that's hot in the more trying to keep it family here all right so that really hurt now we got mashed potatoes how we're going to get that over there some people like to use spoons maybe that's a smart thing to do but I'm just going to go ahead and use my hands i told you i was a lazy okay now see we got a lot of a real estate still on that plate but that's okay because right over here we have some corn cooking we have some bread making oh hi there as you can see we're almost done with our real deals 30-minute meals take a look doesn't that look fantastic you got a little space on each plate here for the bread take that up real nice and easy and of course it only took four minutes for each place to cook that's a grand total of sixteen minutes plus going to Thorne's about 30 minutes now you almost then once the parsley on because that makes you look like a hero oh how cute he is putting importantly in all the place but don't forget you gotta dispose of the evidence and that's the real deal 30 minute meal see you guys happy third-year anniversary you're glad it's a good meal for you and we're happy to have you here we love you very much we love you do thank you guys thank you enjoy the meal is it food good my cousins yet to eat his plate of food alia everything
okay first things first I'm gonna get a big pot of chicken stock going because the chicken gets poached in the stock and then the stock you make the sauce with that's the base for the two different

pan for me a layer of it already coat this in the sauce okay now this is the point where you'd split it up if you're making this two ways the divan and the Tetrazzini it's at this point you divide it in half and you could pop it in the freezer put it in the fridge if you want to have it two nights that week if you're doing chicken a couple nights that week just pop it in the fridge for a few days freezes up great too and we're gonna turn half of this into the divan and then half of it into the Tetrazzini cool right but it's all out of that one base sauce and one big batch of chicken that's so cool I love this recipe it's delish mommy will salt salt pepper salt pepper oh just pour this over right mom yes mom you want to grab that Gruyere cheese there now this is the divan divine it's the broccoli the chicken the special sauce top it with a load of that Gruyere cheese and then we're just gonna pop it under the preheated broiler and brown it up really well mommy can you put cheese all over that do you have I'm gonna put the noodles into the egg noodles that's for the Tetrazzini and these are gonna go with mushrooms and egg noodles beautiful I'm just slicing up mushrooms now for the Tetrazzini which is one of the two dishes we're making today out of our one chicken base we got nice cremini mushrooms here and I've got my pan all preheated I'm just gonna hit it with a little evo Oh extra virgin olive oil get my mushrooms in there mmm smells good how's this going to saute toes yes I can cuz the noodles are just good here what do you think mom hey noodles look alright they look perfect actually here's the thing the divan the one bubbling under the broiler that's the chicken the sauce Grier cheese and broccoli right and it's super duper sauce and we made a double batch of the sauce poach some chicken set it back in the sauce and now we're doing my mom's Tetrazzini you get our breadcrumbs ready now mom tops the Tetrazzini with both bread crumbs and cheese so that's the way I'm doing it of course wouldn't want to mess with that one on each side here okay mushrooms in okay I'll switch with your mom cuz I want to lift that pan for you it's nice I don't want you to be dealing with that that's good that's fine get your self stationed there for the breadcrumb topping okay up fold those mushrooms right in oh this looks so awesome mom my mom's got a little bit of nutmeg in her cream sauce and let me tell you it makes such a difference and this isn't knockoff cream sauce there's not a lot of cream in it just a half a cup it's mostly chicken stock well that looks awesome killer good that looks fine so hit it with some breadcrumbs I'll hit it with some cheese and we'll like Batman and Robin it grooviness going in the oven now this just goes into our hot oven just to brown up the toppings there I bet you that demands divine now let's check that mom it looks awesome look how it browned we took one sauce one big pot of special sauce it's the cream right mom the chicken stock just a little bit of cream chicken of stock right and a base the quick roux and some shallots in there that one sauce little pinch a nutmeg right okay that one sauce coated all these chicken breasts we had four full breasts eight pieces of chicken breast that we poached in that sauce and then you split it into two dinners one dinner is the divine divan and then this is the Tetrazzini this the one mom really loves it's got the noodles and some sauteed wild mushrooms in there and it Browns up really nice in the oven with the bread crumbs and the cheese
again very close hi this is all the way flower button and drop the roof down to your vegetable gravy give it a stir sticking it up now you're feeling exactly don't keep working it over to bring goes just chopping up some chives every time I use dark beings I we have always a little gray nothing really brings out the you need the depth of flavor okay what positioned so that your cattle will still be about give is a good I wish you can make these things you like
two biggest challenges for working people or eating healthy and not having enough time to properly prepare for a meal what are your strategies of working around those I think I gave up a long time ago because my mom never lived this way is that that whole idea that you can have balance in your life I I just don't think exists I will not give up I you started this I think you have to be a little bit cognizant of that and you have to forgive yourself if dinner's at eight instead of 630 and I think it's about where he put your priorities my mom let us stay up past bedtime if she could get home after working and make sure she was with us at the table the table was really the function of communicating with each other and getting some meaning out of her day it wasn't whether she physically was in the kitchen for two hours prior to that if she defrosted something or even if she brought home from a restaurant and I lived that way today it's not you know what time we dinner it's if I can still come home and go through the process of making dinner and sit down and share a half an hour an hour with my husband my mom my friends that my niece my nephew my dog even if I'm alone in my husband's traveling it's meaningful to me as a human being to be able to go home and make a little 6-inch bin frittata for myself and instead of just eating a bowl of cold cereal or take out or make a handful of spaghetti and you know put a little kale and onions and garlic and chewing and I feel better if I can provide for myself and when I started out in my own life my food budget for the entire week was ironically forty dollars I felt so empowered to be able to buy a whole chicken some root vegetable some dry beans to be able to provide for myself whether your child is going to be the next rocket scientist neurosurgeon or the next great chef it is very empowering for a young person to be able to provide for themselves and then later in life to be able to provide food for the people they care about it gives you great self-esteem it gives you great sense of being you know you feel safe when you get off the subway if you know you can go home and make food for yourself you have to stand on line or go out someplace or meet a bunch of friends to try and you know get somebody to buy your burger you go home and need a little bit of soup or something you got in the cupboard it gives you a great a great sense of um well just being safe you know and knowing yourself and I'm person who was mugged twice at gunpoint hospitalized the second time hadn't heard some ultras like Liv Tyler blow all of it was okay as long as I could provide for myself I didn't have to call mom and say I'm in dire straits I'm okay and I will always be okay cuz I can make my way
more television catchphrases come from your family while growing up or you've come up with them yourself such as nice guy yeah when it's already every hour I said oh my god that's good my mother my whole life but she taste something delicious oh my god was like a dubby oh my god it's delicious and when my grandpa was alive she told my god daddy that's the best day ever tasted and my grandpa passed oh my God my girl if it was myself or my sister shit in kitchen oh my god my boy my brother she always said oh my god that's most delicious they divert right when I went on Food Network I started saying oh my god that's delicious and some people were offended by me saying God so I started to say young but I couldn't stop myself I day yeah I'm oh my god it was now an effective technique so they can't mention it to me that I was offending people with God and like my mother's Catholic and she never said I mean sound like I'm saying GD this is some really good shit hey I was just saying oh my god that's good but um after while the young oh my god didn't work either so I would try and cut myself off and it became yum oh I would stop at the Oh short of the my god um you have some really great ones Evie follow which everybody probably knows extra virgin olive oil was just about demystifying it for grocery store shoppers for rich people extra virgin olive oil is truly extra virgin olive oil has a very low heat temperature and it's bright green very free for anybody goes through price chopper eb oo was a raid to make you overpay for regular oven it was bright yellow looked like pee and it was absolutely fine to cook with so i said just buy the evo oh that i was the lowest price for a while a short term when grocery stores were trying to take over the gourmet food trade every regular olive oil would put extra virgin olive oil on the label it was a product of its time in history now I try and write 0 0 or Halle broke because now there really is crow Schuster olive oil that is extra virgin and olive oil but when I was teaching cooking my family only cooked in olive on my whole life and unfortunately for a short amount of time the grow store you could only buy extra virgin olive oil and I'm standing alone in the kitchen talking myself and vegetables then I just got sick of saying it over and over again I'm just like whatever evo just grab the DVR arm around cuz im bored talking myself I'm just there alone making four or five shows a day like three guys my favorite ratio is on trade ties up tell us about it because to me finally somebody said what I earn millions of people want sometimes for a meal I think that people look at food with too many rules if you're a half not you think it's too complicated to achieve if you are a have you think you have to produce for everyone that comes to your house this course I that course and the next and a person in the know well pastas a preemie it's not an entree or you have to have the appetizer followed by this followed by that this is not you know Victorian era exactly any user it's ridiculous you should make the food that makes you feel comfortable and you should put out the food that you're proud of if you want to put out deviled eggs and deviled ham and liverwurst with some roots lager toast great fine and then serve cookies if you want to make a big bowl of pasta put that in the middle of the table and then serve some a big tube of Isis from the corner you know lemon ice if I it's your party I think everybody on both ends of the spectrum is too many rules about this stuff okay the plate is yours so I try and put a sense of humor about it to remind people to not take their food so seriously appetizers can be an entree your pasta doesn't have to be free me you don't need nine courses you don't need a full bar you can make one cocktail and offer soft drinks and beer in one wine if you don't have to have this pressure I don't care if you're rich or poor I never met anybody like to be bothered or spent too much money period I don't care if you're old young rich poor it's your house you should be happy in it and you should do what makes you feel comfortable in it I just don't understand the opposite unless you literally royalty your mom have a GD growing up my mother had a boob and marine bucket so this is this is rachel's turn I'm a garbage at Waterbeach bowl if you work in restaurants if you work on a line there's a scrap bucket cut into the sandwich board in front of the grill if you work in a proper kitchen usually take this square part of a ban marie and you leave it for scrap because you'll get your head hit if you throw away food that should go into stock you don't throw away scrap in my mom's kitchen mmm she always had a big Hotel pan or a half hotel or a half sheet and she throw everything on its crap here garbage there and she'd walk over and separated out and you know take care of the other night but whether we were at home or at work we always had scrapped bucket the garbage bowl I tried to explain this to Food Network and they're like well we just can't you can't have you going on air with literally a bucket that looks like a trough so they suggested this pretty malla mean thing that matched the set that was very hot on ebay the time that a friend of mine collected Texas where and the Texas where bowl became the garbage bowl but it was always in our home yes because you know we're fruit service people but it used to just be a stainless steel well you know buckets quicker puppet thing
I'm going to start by preheating the oven to 375 that's for oven baked corn dogs of course out of the refrigerator to make the actual corn batter that we're going to use I'm going to grab some milk and butter and I need the eggs too now I'm making mine kind of chilly style the actual corn batter is gonna taste like chili so I'm gonna spice it up a little hot sauce and I'm gonna grab some scallions to put a little color in there and Oh jumbo pakka dogs now is there any more boardwalk food than big hotdog YUM okay down here I'm gonna use these bowls to help me carry everything I think cuz I need to load up the corn muffin mix and some spices out of the pantry let's get all of that in there yeah that was a good idea that'll help me carry a little bit more you know me I never one make two trips okay I'm gonna put some chili powder and some cumin nice smoky cumin into the batter like I said it's gonna taste like a chili dog come on there I think that works and then I'm gonna grab the corn muffin mix of course we need that pre-measured ingredients are a girl who can't bakes best friend got my garlic on here too Wow I wish there was some sort of boardwalk game that involved carrying lots of stuff coz I'd win now when I was really really little we lived out in Cape Cod near all the beaches and all fun all the excitement of that I've always been really lucky in that I grew up in resort areas then we moved to Lake George in upstate New York we have a huge boardwalk there it's really cool really fun the arcades and all the different you know like the House of Wax Museum Mini Putt golf and all that I love being near the water it is so much fun and one of the things we kids really loved about it was all the junk food we could eat but you know this isn't junk food at all this is gonna be really healthy well-balanced meal actually the kids will love it it'll look like it's something that's bad for him but it's not and you'll love it cuz it'll remind you of all the fun you've had at boardwalks okay I've got half a stick of butter in there now we're gonna bake it in the oven it's not deep-fried we need a little bit of butter so it'll Brown up no big deal pop it into the microwave and oh you know I'm gonna need a cup I'll just use my coffee cup cuz you know I don't have those measuring things and I'm gonna go ahead and start making up our batter here now we need two packages eight ounces each any brand you like of corn muffin mix dump those into the bowl and then we're just gonna spice them up so the actual corn batter tastes just like chili cuz the only thing that can make corn dog better is in my opinion chili okay two of those to that I'm gonna add about a tablespoon of chili powder I'm just gonna measure that in the palm of my hand that's about a palm fault and you go then I'm gonna add some nice smoky cumin I'll be with you in a minute buttered about two teaspoons of that it's about two-thirds of a palm full boom in there that goes all the same spice combinations I used to make a bowl of chili actually that's what I'm doing here a couple of shakes a hot sauce that's cayenne pepper and vinegar of course and then we're gonna go get that melted butter close enough there's a couple little bits left in there but that those will just work themselves out when we stir it all up a couple of eggs two eggs for two boxes of corn muffin mix and then we're gonna start with about a cup and a quarter or a coffee cup and a quarter of the milk and a little bit of scallions in there just for color and to give some oniony action to our chili theme cuz I use lots of onions in my chili so I'll just use a couple little scallions thinly sliced here cut them in half trim off the very tough tops there but then you can use all of the white and all of the green these run my knife through that excellent I'm gonna put in a little bit of salt to a couple of pinches of that didn't go the scallions cup and a quarter of the milk to starch and if we need more we want to loosen it up a little bit then fine we can do that let's start with that okay let's use this big bad whisk here to get it all together real quick break up the egg you might want to give it a poke to get the yolk broken up nice and quickly for you there we go this is coming together quite nicely quite quickly if I do say so myself and I think it looks perfect I don't think we need any more milk at all I think that's gonna be just right I just want to get the lumps out make sure we don't have any big pockets of cornmeal in there perfect so kupo excellent now let's grab our meat fork there we go and I'm gonna use a spoon too just to help me along here I'll show you it couldn't be easier to do this again it's a lot of fun for the kids just break this open and get a nice jumbo dog here now hey you could also use tofu dogs turkey dogs or you could use beef or pork of course these are a nice big juicy beef Frank here and then you dip it right in there and use a spoon to help you coat that corn dog nice really load it up on there then put it on your cookie sheet and just use the spoon to help you slide it right off the fork can also use the spoon to cover up any little bits of dogs that are left exposed there we go really loaded on there that's one of the many benefits of making these at home hey they're not deep-fried so you don't have to feel quite as guilty as eating the ones you might find on the actual boardwalk plus you can really load on those beautiful spicy corn muffin in we spiced up the corn muffin I mean you're not gonna find these down on the boardwalk you know what I mean not with all those spices and green onions going on in there all right you pop them in that 375 oven just let them cook till they're golden brown all over I'm going to show you a neat trick with them you just use a little mop in here so I don't burn myself you can take one of these long bamboo skewers and then it's just like being on the boardwalk you can actually eat the dog off a stick how groovy is that
now kids will love this but I especially love it because it combines some of my favorite flavors peanut butter I'm just insane for peanut butter do you ever just take big ol spoonfuls of it right now did it right now the peanut butter jar just walk around the house look in the peanut butter I know it's crazy it's embarrassing but I know you've done it too yeah that's usually my breakfast during the week that's about as far as I go big old spoonful of peanut butter and then I'm off and running with my coffee but this is a great little snack you can make in no time I've got some nice crunchy natural peanut butter here you need at least a half a cup pop it into the microwave now because you want it to get really soft that's so we can mix it up with some honey yes we can slather it all over our nice bananas now we're gonna make the crunchy topping here take some granola I like to use a granola that has tons of fruit nuts in it so it gives the most flavor to this neat little snack this is a fun one to make you know when you're watching TV at night or great after school snack for the kids a fun little go to breakfast so I got my granola with nuts into the food processor and then I'm just gonna wanna grind it up so become well kind of like healthy sprinkles down on top of the beautiful slathered bananas now the bananas you're gonna want to peel the whole banana just like that Oh smells so good it's a fun little dessert idea too it's pretty healthy for you too I think anything with fruit is healthy you know I'm one of the you know girls think about calories and funny ways I could eat nine of these and figure that it was hey no calories whatsoever cuz it was made with fruit mmm okay with a cup these and apple be with you in one minute peanut butter cut him in half straight across then take some popsicle sticks it's the fun part so you can just pick up these bananas and eat them off a stick you put the popsicle stick right in the center of the banana just line them up in the dish see how easy this is tastes like two seconds to throw this together fun cute and you know if you're doing this meal is a little brunch for your friends I think grown-ups especially love when you eat cute food like this cuz it's just so unexpected it's something that we do all the time for kids but not necessarily for grownup friends you know okay now I'm gonna put in a good old big drizzle of honey into the peanut butter makes it extra sweet and delicious I love honey just honey on hot toast oh so good with butter then you're gonna want to slather it just take a big old goop of it get it down over the banana that when I went a little crazy with didn't I oh well extra peanut butter wow what a shame I'm just I'm just gonna have to eat off the plate with a spoon slather these guys up and then is the peanut butter cools back down we'll get a little firmer they'll be easy to pick them up and then you're going to hit them with your sprinkles your granola nuts sprinkles now we got to take the blade out first but then I'm just gonna leave my sprinkles right in here put my ground gonna run Ola down over the top how good does that look huh yummy yummy crunchy and delicious and you can just pick it up and eat it right off the stick awesome
so very strict vegan vegetarian but even if I feel like
now I'm gonna get myself all set up here to do this turkey show you real quick turkey breasts come out and into the pan then we're gonna get this skin off of the turkey and loosen it up that's where I have my small knife here to help me pull it off so that we can get the herbs in there beautiful let's get this guy going excellent now into that pocket I'm not even gonna use this spatula I'm gonna stuff lots of herbs see that coating it fold that down over the top grab another big handful of the parsley and sage mixture get it in there fold it down over the top I've got my butter melting up here I'm gonna use this to continually base the bird as well get the butter down over it that'll give it some great color - nice there we go salt and pepper again on top of the skin and then when we transfer it to the oven I'm gonna knock that oven back to 400 because I don't want the skin to get black on me I want it nice and crispy and perfect knock that back to 400 when did you ever cook on ol Thanksgiving turkey in less than an hour well I did because I cooked off two turkey breasts boneless turkey breast remember you get these right at the regular market go up and tell your butcher what you need and what you're thinking about look how gorgeous they are huh now just like with any other meat I've ever made on 30 Minute Meals you got to give it time to rest to let the juices distribute so I'm gonna take the turkey out and transfer to the serving platter look how gorgeous that is oh my god that gorgeous it's full of herbs you can see the herbs that we put underneath the skin it smells so fragrant and amazing I'm just going to pick out the bay leaves that we had in these pan drippings here because we need to get them out to make our gravy and I'm gonna put a little heat right underneath the pan that I roasted the turkey in to bring it up to temperature cuz I'm gonna turn these wonderful pan drippings into gravy so I'm gonna add a few tablespoons of flour so it can be our thickening agent I'm gonna whisk that in so we don't get lumps and there's not a lot of fat in there because of course we just made turkey breasts right I'm gonna let that cook for a minute I've got a nice bubble up on this I'm gonna season it up with a little salt and pepper Oh smells amazing and I've got all that nice turkey broth in there and it's gonna thicken up beautifully with my flour and now I'm gonna add a layer of flavor with the apple brandy don't worry about the alcohol in here it cooks right off just a splash of that in there and then let it reduce a minute it'll intensify the flavor and the alcohol burns right away and then chew that I'm gonna add some of the cider see that's the theme it layers into every course of our meal here Apple Apple Apple so it'll slightly sweeten our gravy too and make it really interesting well put the cap back on hello so get that in there oh yeah and just keep working that together this is just bubbling away I took the drippings from that because they were just full of good turkey flavor and not too much fat because it was just turkey breast right and I thickened it up with a little flour seasoned it up with a little salt and pepper then the theme ingredient of my Thanksgiving feast is apples so I doubled up on my apple flavor I added a little bit of apple brandy to it and let it cook out so I'd cook the alcohol off and concentrate the flavor of the brandy mmm oh man is that good one more grind of black pepper I think cuz it's super sweet cuz I also put apple cider in here what a nice surprise and look at the gorgeous brown color we got out of that gravy now I'm gonna get that into my gravy boat here just pour that off and into there oh look at the gloss and the color to that beautiful check out this turkey how gorgeous is this now remember these two and a half pound turkey breasts I started with two of them have layers of flavor going all around them herbs everywhere on the bottom of the pan I started with Evo oh and lots of fresh bay leaf as the oven heated up that bay leaf the flavor went up through the meat between the meat and the skin look at this look at all this green in here that's another layer of fresh herbs parsley and sage I combined that in a food processor with some lemon zest and some extra-virgin olive oil and then I put it in between the two and there's just flavor everywhere and look how nice and crispy it is that's because we put it into a super hot oven and then we basted it with even more herbaceous flavor melted butter with Bailey from the butter - isn't this gorgeous now the cool thing about this is that you could actually make three of these guys in the same amount of time you can make two of these guys just line them up in their roasting pan and then you can feed up to twelve people this right here - two and a half pound pieces of boneless turkey breast that would feed up to eight adults gorgeous isn't it really pretty

Rachael Domenica Ray is an American television personality, businesswoman, celebrity chef and author. She hosts the syndicated daily talk and lifestyle program Rachael Ray, and three Food Network series,. Ray wrote cookbooks based on the 30 Minute Meals concept, and launched a magazine, Every Day with Rachael Ray, in 2006. Ray's television shows have won three Daytime Emmy Awards. Early life Rachael Ray was born in Glens Falls, New York. Her parents are James Ray, who is of French, Scottish and Welsh descent, and Elsa Scuderi, a Sicilian American. She moved to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where her family owned four restaurants. When Ray was 8, her family moved to Lake George, New York. Her mother managed restaurants in upstate New York. In 1995, Ray moved to New York City. One of her first jobs there was at the candy counter at Macy's, where she eventually managed the fresh foods department. She later helped open a New York City market. Moving back to upstate New York, Ray managed Mister Brown's Pub at The Sagamore, a hotel on Lake George. From there, she became a buyer at Cowan &amp; Lobel, a gourmet market in Albany. Ray credits the concept of 30 Minute Meals to her experience working at the store, where she met people who were reluctant to cook. She taught a course in which she showed how to make meals in less than thirty minutes. With the success of her "30 Minute Meals" classes, WRGB asked her to appear in a weekly segment on their newscasts. This, along with a public radio appearance and the publication of her first book, led to a Today show spot and her first Food Network contract in 2001. Career Cooking Ray teaches simple recipes that she says can be completed in 30 minutes or less, although critics claim that her concept does not include preparation. Ray says that her Sicilian maternal grandfather, Emmanuel Scuderi, and her Cajun ancestry serve as a strong influence on her cooking. She uses ingredients such as fresh herbs, garlic and chicken stock to boost flavors. She believes that measuring "takes away from the creative, hands-on process of cooking" and instead favors approximations such as "half a palmful." To critics of her shortcut techniques, Ray responds, "I have no formal anything. I'm completely unqualified for any job I've ever had." She acknowledges that she cannot bake because it requires measured ingredients, that she cannot make coffee, and that she burns bread under the broiler. On her television programs, she has used catchphrases such as "E-V-O-O", "yum-o," "G.B.", "Oh my gravy!", "entréetizer", "stoup", and "choup". In 2007, The Oxford American College Dictionary announced the addition of the term EVOO, short for extra-virgin olive oil, which Ray had helped to popularize, and credited her with coining the phrase. The set of 30 Minute Meals uses a yellow Model 61C Chambers stove from the 1950s, notable for its top-opening broiler, super-insulated oven, and unique Thermowell. On November 12, 2006, Ray and Mario Batali defeated the team of Bobby Flay and Giada De Laurentiis on an episode of Iron Chef America during which cranberries were the secret ingredient. On March 18, 2007, Food Network debuted a Rachael Ray episode of its special Chefography series, on which she stated that "the worst day of [her] life" was Iron Chef America, admitting to being anxious about it for weeks before. She also told commentator Alton Brown that she was "a cook, not a chef." Mo Rocca, then one of the guest judges for that episode and later host of My Grandmother's Ravioli, disagreed. Television In 2005, Ray signed a deal to host a syndicated daytime TV talk show. The show, Rachael Ray, premiered on September 18, 2006. Recurrent appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show were used to fuel the launch, much as Dr. Phil's show was spun off based on his own frequent visits to Oprah. The show tapes in New York City. In coordination with the syndication announcement, Ray said, "People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share." Ray has appeared on The View, The Today Show, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the Late Show with David Letterman, Nightline, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Larry King Live, Cake Boss, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and The Dr. Oz Show. For Sesame Street’s 38th season, Ray appeared in an episode to present "pumpernickel" as the word of the day. On January 12, 2008, Ray's television series Rachael's Vacation premiered on the Food Network. The show is a five-part food travelogue shot in various European countries. In 2008, Ray became a television executive producer of a short-lived Latin cooking show on the Food Network called Viva Daisy!, starring Daisy Martínez. In August 2009, Ray appeared as herself on Million Dollar Password for charity for Yum-O! and her own charity for animal rescue with Regis Philbin. Ray also appeared on the hidden-camera show I Get That a Lot, pretending to be an employee at a dry cleaners. In September 2010, a new show, her first new cooking show in eight years, Rachael Ray's Week In a Day began airing on the Cooking Channel. In January 2012, Rachael was one of the two team captains in the Food Network reality series Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. Magazines In 2003, she posed for the men's magazine FHM. A writer for The New York Times wrote, "The shots feature Ray in short-shorts with an exposed midriff, licking chocolate off a big wooden spoon, eating a strawberry and sitting in a sink, laughing as suds cascade down her thighs." In a March 2009 interview with Nightline co-anchor Cynthia McFadden, Ray defended her decision to pose in the magazine. The Reader's Digest Association launched Ray's eponymous magazine, Every Day with Rachael Ray on October 25, 2005. The magazine featured seven issues in 2006, and increased to ten issues in 2007. On October 12, 2011, it was announced that Meredith Corporation had reached an agreement to acquire Every Day with Rachael Ray. Product endorsements In November 2006, Ray became a spokeswoman for Nabisco crackers. She appears in commercials and on boxes for the many Nabisco products. Many boxes with Ray's picture have her recipes. In February 2007, WestPoint Home launched sheets, blankets, and coverlets designed by Ray. Within six months, WestPoint expanded Ray's bed and bath line to include the "Moppine", a two-in-one dish towel/oven mitt, as Ray is often seen with a kitchen towel over her shoulder that doubles for her as an ersatz mitt. In March 2007, the Dunkin' Donuts company announced Ray as its celebrity endorser, mainly of its coffee, since she had denied being able to make coffee herself. As part of a promotional campaign, Ray describes the company's coffee as "fantabulous." In May 2007, Ray's recipes were made available on AT&amp;T cellular phones via the "Rachael Ray Recipes on the Run" feature. In July 2008, Rachael Ray's "Nutrish" pet food was introduced. The dog foods are created from recipes that Ray developed for her pit bull, Isaboo. All proceeds from the sale of these products go to Rachael's Rescue, a charity founded by Ray to help at-risk animals. Personal life On September 24, 2005, in Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy, Ray married John Cusimano, an American lawyer and lead singer of the rock band The Cringe. She owns homes in Lake Luzerne, New York, and Manhattan's Greenwich Village. Charity work In 2006, Rachael Ray launched a nonprofit organization called Yum-O! The mission of Yum-O! is to “empower kids and their families to develop healthy relationships with food and cooking. This is achieved by teaching families to cook, feeding hungry kids, and funding cooking education”.

I'm making what I call spaghetti and meatballs stoop that's because it's thinner than a stew but thicker than a soup I'm gonna start the soup with classic soup fixins carrot celery and onion got to get a couple of cloves of garlic in there if you give it a good whack the garlic I mean just a good crack with your knife it'll be good to go with a lot less chopping just pop the skins off that and half the work is done for you and it'll get nice and soft and yummy in the soup it'll sweeten up and get delicious run my knife through that real quick kind of mill it got a little piece of skin on my finger there okay into the pot it goes give it a little stir hmm now we're gonna start those meatballs now ground meatloaf mix is ground beef pork and veal combined and you get it right in the regular grocery store you could also certainly use just ground sirloin for this that would be excellent now to the meat I'm gonna add some bread crumbs here and then about half as much of the bread crumbs I'm gonna use that as grated cheese the cheese really adds such a great flavor this nice parmigiano-reggiano here has a really mild and nutty flavor to it just gonna sprinkle that in if you use about 3/4 of a cup of bread crumbs to a cup you want to use about half that amount and cheese to that I'm gonna chop a little parsley here and just throw that in there that just brightens up the flavor the Italian breadcrumbs of course just have dried seasoning in them so this just brightens everything up a little bit and then I'm going to get this on up here and get the egg in there so I can start mixed it up now when you're making the meatballs you want to go for a golf ball-sized here I had about a pound of ground beef pork and veal combined that's called meatloaf mix to that I added some Italian breadcrumbs some grated cheese a little fresh parsley and an egg and some salt and pepper and you roll it up into balls about this size here about an inch and a half to two inches now I'm just going to get my hands rinsed off so it's a combination basically of soup and just spaghetti and meatballs supper all in one pot now I'm gonna add the liquids the meatballs are gonna cook like meat dumplings right in the soup itself adding lots of flavor now I'm going to add my combination of chicken stock here hands are too wet to get into that little guy well take a little help from a knife I'm gonna add a combination of chicken stock you want 1/4 of that and 3 cups of tomato sauce you could also use marinara if you had that left over in the fridge you could use stewed tomatoes you just want to have a combination of stock and tomato product ok I'm gonna crank the heat on that get these tomatoes in there little kids love this meal and they could totally help you make it invite them into the kitchen with you whenever you're cooking it's nice family time to not just eating dinner together but making dinner together and I was really lucky because I grew up in a family where my mom loved to cook at home but she also worked in restaurants she didn't want anybody else watching her kids right so she used to take us with her everywhere and I'm lucky because I grew up learning so much about food and feeling really comfortable in the kitchen so I don't really dread cooking when I get home at the end of the day but a lot of my friends really do that's why I try and come up with meals like this that are like really foolproof can do easy easy easy meals look how good that looks yummy so we got the tomato and the stock working together with the fresh veggies that'll make the store-bought stock taste nice and slow cooked in homemade put a lid on it as I said crank up the heat to bring that up to a fast boil now I'm adding my meatballs to my spaghetti and meatball soup here and I'm doing it one at a time so that I don't get splattered on cuz this is boiling I put a lid on it and brought my combination of chicken stock tomato sauce root vegetables and garlic up to a fast boil then I dropped in my meatballs that was just the ground beef pork and veal combined with bread crumbs cheese a little fresh parsley an egg salt and pepper all right I'm gonna get my spaghetti in the pot just gonna take a good handful of it you certainly can't add a whole pound in there it would suck up all the juice right now in this one case mom I hope you're not watching I'm gonna break the spaghetti in half just cuz it's soup you don't want big long pieces of spaghetti hanging out of your spoon when you're trying to get it up to your mouth so I'm gonna add my spaghetti see I put the meatballs in a couple minutes before the spaghetti coz the meatballs take like add around 10 minutes to cook through and the spaghetti doesn't need that long only needs like 7 or 8 minutes to get to al dente with a nice bite to it now my meatballs were a combination of beef pork and veal with breadcrumbs and grated cheese the soup itself was root vegetables and garlic and a combination of chicken stock and tomato sauce now I'm mixing in some torn leaves of basil I put in a handful of spaghetti and now that is just perfect I'm just gonna turn it off and give it a quick taste for seasoning it's good to go normally I would add a pinch of salt but I like grated cheese on top of my spaghetti and meatball soup so I'm gonna hold off on the extra salt there cuz the cheese is nice and salty oh look how good this looks huh and even if you're just making this for yourself a leftovers our killer kids so make a big pot my dog boo could always help beat this one - she loves spaghetti and meatballs look how good that looks Oh amazing

[theme music] I love dessert. And there is no better dessert than a crepe cake from Lady M Cake Boutique. The flavors of cakes are so unique. Whether it's matcha flavored or just chocolate, I know the crepe cakes will hit the spot, which is why I decided to make a Lady-M-inspired crepe cake at home. So what we have here is the crepe batter. And a crepe batter is very similar to a pancake batter, it just has a lot more eggs in it. And this is a big batch. This is a batch that is big enough to make about 25 crepes. I put one ladleful in, and then tilt the pan, coating the whole bottom of it. The first couple of these crepes are going to look kind of rough, because that's just what it is. Anyone who's made pancakes knows this. So do not lose heart if the first one doesn't look completely right. I have two little tools here. I have my metal spatula and a tiny little rubber spatula. So I use the tiny rubber spatula just to kind of lift them up, so that this guy can slide underneath without breaking any edges. The first time I saw a crepe cake was actually on Pinterest. And I thought it just was so cool. I actually thought that it was a normal cake where someone had really thinly sliced the layers. And I thought, oh my gosh, that sounds so intimidating and challenging. But when I realized it was a crepe cake, I thought, oh my gosh. That's super doable. Today's flavor is going to be caramel apple, which I love. I think it's such a classic. But the cool thing about a crepe cake is you can actually kind of do any flavor combination you like. Our crepes are finished. They've fully cooled. So it's time to put everything together. Making the apple puree could not be simpler. It's just roasted apples pureed with a little bit of lemon juice, cinnamon, and sugar. Blend it all together and you have a perfect apple puree. We have our salted caramel sauce, and this is super simple, as well. Just caramelize sugar with a little bit of cream and butter added, and then, of course, a healthy pinch of salt. I'm just going to take this first crepe. Add a layer of stuff, and then add another crepe, more stuff, and just basically keep going until I feel like it's high enough. All right. So I'm going to first put a nice pile of the apple on top. You just push everything to the outer edges, just so it peeks through. I'm going to move on to my next layer, a tiny amount of the salted caramel, because I actually want to save quite a bit of this to drizzle on top. I'm just going to sort of smooth this around. Another crepe, and then I'll do a few tablespoons of mascarpone cheese. And then I just repeat this whole process basically however high I want it to go. Gorgeous. OK. I wanted to show you guys something. So you can see on this side it looks fine, but it's sort of missing some pizzazz. So if you look over here-- what? You can see that by pushing all the ingredients at the edges, it's a sneak peek for people looking at the cake to know what flavors are in it. So the last final touch is adding the salted caramel on top. I'm so excited about this. And I'm actually going to go out and create, on purpose, little rivers. I don't want a swimming pool of caramel on top. So I just have this amount here, and I'm just going to spread it out. Then I'm going to finish it with some sea salt. Look at those layers. That is amazing. Mmm. Sorry, I just did a little crepe dance, but you've got to. It's so good. [theme music]
NARRATOR: How to make chocolate sprinkles. Sprinkles were invented in 1936 by a Dutch company. In Holland and Belgium, they consumer sprinkles on toast. Yep. In a bowl, add confectioner's sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Then you can add water, vanilla extract, and a little bit of instant coffee. Instant coffee's optional, but it actually enhances the chocolate flavor-- only as if chocolate could get any better. Mix everything until there are no more lumps left. Transfer to a pastry bag with the tip number two. And over a silicone mat, pipe long, parallel lines with the chocolate batter. Let it dry at room temperature for 24 hours. When dry, cut them all in the same size and store them in an airtight container. Now you're free to sprinkle sprinkles anywhere you want. Sprinkle sprinkles sound funny. Did you love this video?

[theme music] It's really great to live in modern times where we have a portable version of everything that surrounds us-- a phone, a computer, even an orange. Technically, this is a kumquat, but I like to call it tiny orange. You know what, even an analogue record player has its own compact version. Very incredible and amazing. But you know what I wish I had a portable version as well? Our favorite desserts. I mean, are we always supposed to make a pie to share? Of course not. Today, I'm going to show you how to make a very perfect and classic lemon meringue pie, but in a stick for you to carry around anywhere you go. And then you can also eat by yourself and not feel guilty to make a huge pie. So I'm going to start by making the lemon curd, which is a super delicious filling, very traditional. And I'm going to start making my lemon curd by zesting one lemon. Don't zest the white pith, because it's too bitter. I'm going to squeeze the juice in here. Don't worry about the seeds, we're going to sift it later. Always use fresh citrus fruit. And if you buy from a can, it doesn't have the tanginess that we need here. So right here I'm going to add my eggs. It's still going to be cooked in a double boiler. And I'm also going to add my sugar. And now I'm going to add my butter. Beautiful. So here I have everything in the double boiler, a pan with water underneath. Don't let the water touch the bottom of the bowl, cause this is going to increase the temperature too much. And the eggs need to settle-- oh [bleep]. Oh, I dropped this. So the eggs need to settle very slowly, otherwise it will curdle. And you don't want your lemon curd to look like scrambled eggs. Cook you curd for approximately 25 minutes, stirring every once in a while. This is going to get thick and opaque. Hydrate the gelatin sheets in cold water and add it to the warm lemon curd. This is going to melt beautifully. Look at the viscosity of this. You strain your curd to remove the seeds and pour it over a pan covered with plastic wrap. Now we just have to freeze the lemon curd for at least four hours in my portable freezer. [music playing] It didn't fit in there, so now I have to place the curd in my real but boring and unportable freezer. This is the perfect combination between sweet and sour. But a real lemon meringue pie is not a pie without a graham cracker crust. And of course, I'm going to show you how to make a homemade version. In a bowl add butter, honey, and brown sugar. Mix it until pale yellow and very fluffy. Then you can add salt, cinnamon, baking soda, flour, wheat flour, and wheat germ. Stir everything until combined. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough. And with the help of a rolling pin, open the dough until you reach a half inch of thickness. Slice the dough in rectangles of five by one inches. Cut off the edges and freezes this dough for 10 minutes. Then you can bake it at 350 Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. Remove the lemon curd from the freezer and slice it into the size you want your pop to be. Insert one graham cracker stick on each pop. It slides in so easy because the lemon curd never completely freezes. If you don't want to use the cracker as the stick, you can use a regular would stick. Make sure you insert a graham cracker inside the pop before the stick, so you get the crunchiness from it. [music playing] Let's pretend this never happened. Now we just have to make the last step of the recipe, the meringue. In a bowl for a double boiler, add the egg whites and the sugar, and cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. If you dip your fingers, you shouldn't feel any crystals left. Immediately transfer to a mixer and mix it until it's cool, fluffy, beautiful, and shiny, also known as a hard peak. A hard peak is a spike that forms in the tip of the whisk. As soon as you achieve this, stop whipping, or you'll stretch the egg whites too much and they will collapse. The meringue is ready. And now we just have to dip the pop into it. So I'm going to transfer this to another container. It has to be high enough so we can cover the entire surface of the pop with it. Beautiful. And you dip in. [music playing] With the back of a spoon, make the surface wavy and resemble a lemon pie. And torch it until it's toasty and beautiful. Now that my lemon meringue pie on a stick is ready, I can finally take it anywhere I want. [music playing] (SINGING) I move with the sound, give every part of me. I move with the sound. I move with the sound, bleach out the fat in me. I move with the sound. It's hard to believe that all these flavors were just in one single stick. (SINGING) I move with the sound. Yes. It is better than a regular lemon meringue pie, my friends. I you want more awesome videos like this, subscribe to Food Network's YouTube channel. We have it all there. So many options.

NARRATOR: How to make creme brulee without a torch. Creme brulee in French means 'burnt cream.' And to make your own, in a pan, add heavy cream and vanilla-- with the seeds, of course. Cook it over medium heat until it comes to a boil. Cover with the lid and let it steep for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, add the egg yolks and whisk it with the sugar until it's pale yellow and fluffy. Continue on whisking and temper the egg yokes with the hot cream-- it means making the yolks slightly hotter. Remove the vanilla bean from it. Now, my secret ingredient-- mascarpone-- mm, so rich in fat, that makes everything creamier. Pour the better into shallow ramekins and bake it in a water bath at 300 Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. Once they have cooled, we can broil the top. I'm not using a torch. I'm going to use to a spoon. Select one that you don't love, 'cause it's going to get destroyed. It has to be a metal spoon. Place the back of it in direct heat and let this heat up for a few minutes, or until it gets really red. Always wear and oven mitt for extra safety. Spread a thin layer of sugar on top of the creme brulee, and burn it with the burning spoon. The handle won't be hot, 'cause silverware don't conduct heat. Now, you just have to get ready for the orchestra of crunchiness. Beautiful. That's what I call real happiness. Hey, don't forget to subscribe to Food Network's YouTube channel. Hmm.

NARRATOR: How to make maraschino cherries. Start by washing fresh cherries. Then, with the help of a clip-- yeah, a paperclip-- remove the pits and place in a sterilized jar. It's time to make the syrup. In a pan, add sugar, water, and salt. Cook it over medium heat for eight minutes, or until the sugar crystals the salt. Turn off the heat and add lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, and almond extract. Almond extract is what enhances the maraschino flavor. Amazing!

Over low heat, I'm going to melt this chocolate. And I'm gonna show you all the steps this is gonna go through. You should never melt chocolate over high heat or you'll burn it. You're gonna think, whoa, this is looking awesome. You're going to start to think that this is actually a little bit weird. The chocolate is going to crystallize, and you're definitely going to think you screwed up. But if it's golden brown, just remove from the heat. But in a few minutes off the heat, this baby's gonna melt again and turn beautiful. In a food processor, add the caramelized white chocolate. Bloom the gelatin in cold water and add it to the warm milk. Once it's soft, add the warm milk with gelatin in the food processor, as soon as the warm milk goes in, add the cold heavy cream. This temperature change will emulsify everything and make it beautiful. Woo, well, let's hurry because my food processor is spitting out my cream. Transfer all the contents to a bowl. Roughly chop your walnuts and add it to the caramelized filling. [music playing] Well, let me try again. I'm gonna show you how to make a super flaky crust. It's not crumbly. It's flaky. Because those are two different things. It's the most traditional French one called pate brisee. Very easy to put together and it works every time even when you put zero effort to make it work. In a bowl, add flour, sugar, salt, and butter. And now, your hands are the only tool you need. Quickly work the cold butter and the dry ingredients until it reassembles sand. Add cold water and work it just enough to bring it all together. Refrigerate this for one hour. Split the dough among six individual tin molds and prick the surface. Bake it at 350 Fahrenheit until golden brown. Fill them with the white chocolate caramelized cream and reserve. To make the floral top, I like to use honeycrisp apples because, well, they're crispy. You slice half of an apple very thinly in a mandolin. Stack them perfectly together and cut it in half. Make a long stripe of sliced apples, overlapping them a little bit. Brush them with a lemon to prevent oxidizing and browning and roll it tight together just like you would do with a little rolled cake. Place them on top of the filled tart and fan out the petals so they can cover the entire surface. If you don't have a mandolin, slice the apples with a knife and soak them in water for 30 seconds. This way, they will be flexible enough for you to roll them. Ah, this tart is the perfect marriage between the flavors. You have a super flaky, buttery crust, and you have the most amazing filling ever with this caramelized white chocolate and walnuts. And then, this all goes really well with the honeycrisp apples. That brings that tartness to it that goes well with the caramel, that goes well with the walnut, that goes well with the butter in the crust. It's like-- it's breaking. Time to go in my mouth again. And I almost forgot to tell you, another great use for patterns. They're really awesome to camouflage so you don't have to share your dessert with anybody else. Just kidding. If you bake, you share.

[music playing] I'm completely in love with the space age, the art and fashion movement from the '60s inspired by the space and the idea of the future. But the future is now, and it looks pretty different from what they thought. Well, everything changes, but one thing remains the same-- incredible space. In 1962, the United States launched its first communications satellite into the space, Telstar. And then everybody got inspired to create clothing, furniture, and to think about a futuristic lifestyle that seemed so close to them. They were living in the space age, after all. Ooh, how can I eat that? Our solar system is composed by eight planets that I like to think of food. And Pluto, technically not a planet, but I like to be inclusive. I'm going to steal my favorite ones to decorate my tart. So sorry, universe. Let's start by making the shortcrust. And this is not an average crust, otherwise it wouldn't be called shortcrust. It's super buttery and delicious. So the first ingredient I'm going to add here is butter. Hmm, room temperature, please. Well, room temperature because first I'm going to whisk it with some-- oh, here. I'm going to whisk it with some confectioner's sugar. And then once this is super creamy, I'm going to add the rest of the ingredients. So now I'm going to whisk both of them together until it's super fluffy and pale yellow. And then I'm going to add the egg yolks. And it's really awesome to use confectioner's sugar in your crust, because since confectioner's sugar is 10 times thinner than regular sugar, it's going to give more structure to your crust. Just going to whisk it until it's fluffy. Perfect. And then I'm going to add the cashew. Well, it's actually ground cashew, but you can use ground almonds or any other nut you want. And then I'm going to add the cocoa powder, a pinch of salt, and the flour. This is a really nice crust for you to make with any other of your recipes. And here I'm going to stir just until it all comes together. Don't overwork this dough. You want a flaky, crumbly, delicious crust. As soon as the dough comes all together, shape in a square and get ready to roll it out. Of course, I'm going to take advantage of the futuristic setup here. Place your dough on a countertop and sprinkle some flour. Ew, not that much. The crust is going to get too dry. With a rolling pin, open a rectangle of approximately half inch thick. To avoid tearing, roll the dough on the rolling pin, and then unroll over your pan. Remove the excess dough and poke some holes with a fork so the air can escape. Freeze this for 10 minutes before you bake it, so it's going to get super crunchy. Now we're going to see my crust baking for approximately 15 minutes or until it looks chalky and very opaque. Since it's a chocolate crust, you're not going to see it gaining any color. Oh, maybe you will. I'm so glad I can go back in time. (SINGING) Hey you boys, come on, let's make some noise. One, two, three, sing along with me. OK, here I'm going to rough-- roughly chop my chocolate. You have to melt in a double boiler. Yeah, because chocolate is super sensitive to heat. Every tiny bit, because I'm not the kind of girl to waste any bit of chocolate. OK here, working with chocolate and wearing white, it's not what I would call a perfect combo. As this melts, I'm going to take another pan, and I'm going to heat my cream with my honey. As soon as your chocolate melts and your milk boils, you're ready to combine them. Just turn in a circular motion from the middle to the edges. Some chefs believe it has to be clockwise, but I like to live on the edge. Finish the ganache with butter to make it shinier. You can stop walking now. To prevent the crust from getting soggy, brush a thin layer of melted chocolate on the inside to seal it and keep it crisp for longer. Pour the ganache on the crust and spread it. Refrigerate it for two hours, or just take it to space for three seconds. My tart is ready, completely chilled and smelling wonderful. And now I just have to decorate it. And what better way to represent the Milky Way than with milk chocolate? Decorate the tart with gold powder, white cocoa butter, peach in syrup, cherry, and macaroon that I caramelized some sugar and sandwiched between the shell, so it resembles Saturn's rings. Finish with bonbons. (SINGING) I thought of things you used to say. Did you hear how crunchy it is? It's like a muffled sound, it's like a crunchiness that fulfils your mouth. And then on top of this comes the super creamy milk chocolate ganache in the perfect texture. This chocolate tart is wonderful, marvelous, incredible. But a better way to describe it would be out of this world. (SINGING) When someone believes in you. You can conquer the entire universe if you want to. And it can be in the palm of your hands. No, it's right here, right next to you. And it's delicious. Did you love this video? Then prove it. Subscribe to Food Network's YouTube channel. So many great videos there.
