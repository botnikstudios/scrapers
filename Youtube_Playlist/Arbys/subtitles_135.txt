most people still think that Arby's only serves roast beef sandwiches well if that's the case we sure have a lot of odd-looking roast beef sandwiches this roast beef sandwich looks a lot like a smoked brisket sandwich this one here looks like a Reuben tongue candy and these are the strangest-looking roast beef sandwiches I've ever seen I agree chef thank you all these we have the meats for sandwiches
