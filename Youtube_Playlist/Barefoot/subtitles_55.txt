[Music] my friend Barbara lieth gorgeous daughter Cassandra's getting married this year and I've offered to help with a rehearsal dinner I believe in first impressions and last impressions so I've asked my friend Miguel to do two table settings for Cassandra to choose from and I'm making two over the top desserts first I'm making a Baba au Rhum which is a delicious cake made with yeast and then soaked and I mean soaked in rum syrup and second I'm giving her a choice with a o float on or floating island which is big mounds of meringue floating on a sea of vanilla creme anglaise and drizzled with caramel and pralines Cassandra's coming later to choose which table setting and which dessert she wants for her rehearsal dinner I think it's been really hard to choose so the first dessert that I'm going to suggest for Cassandra's rehearsal dinner is a classic French bistro dessert and it's called Baba au Rhum or a rum Baba and what it is is it's a yeast cake made with currants and it's allowed to rise and it's soaked I mean we're talking soaked with rum syrup and it's absolutely delicious I've been making baba Rome for Jeffrey I think since we first got married and I thought Cassandra would love it for her party okay that's really well buttered now I'm going to start making the cake so the first thing I need is warm milk you need 1/2 a cup of milk heated to 115 degrees that's the ball is really cold you want to eat a little more but if you're not sure about 115 degrees use a thermometer pull one packet of yeast in there's a little bit of a process but you can do it in advance and then soak it just before you're going to serve it one packet of yeast and two tablespoons of sugar the sugar actually makes the yeast grow it's like food for the yeast I just stir it around clean hands you can do it with your fingers let's sit for about five minutes and Lee you'll find is you'll see bubbles it's the carbon dioxide coming out of the yeast and that's how you know it's aligned alive in winter and in the meantime I'm gonna soak the currants in rum mmm that's really everything in this cake is soaked in rum so I need third of a cup of currants that's a really great they're like raisins smaller and they're little tartar so I really like them at a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar it just has much more flavor just one tablespoon and just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just gonna soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling away in the fall okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so with the mixer on low speed I'm gonna put in it first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't clump 1/2 a teaspoon of salt he always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft just gonna make a really light dough put in a little bit at the time and just like Mattoon okay perfect you can see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right now oh damn towel just a kitchen towel just slightly damp towel you don't want it soaking wet just enough so the dough doesn't dry out while it's rising okay uh I think I hear Miguel he's coming to do two table settings for Cassandra and I know that both gonna be so beautiful she'll never be able to choose oh yeah time ago thank you so much for doing this every rehearsal table needs a good stylist and you're red so I got you all kinds of things I got your flowers and I got plates and napkins and glasses I did two different claws you can change anything you like and I've learned through shapes yeah I got two shapes I thought it'd be interesting for a choice of shapes I've cooked me to do right now I understand you're doing buh buh wrong I am I'll see you there and we'll we'll get to taste - good so the guava room dough has been sitting for a bed an hour and should be doubled in volume and it is it's perfect so the next thing I want to do is drain the currents these are soaked in rum I bet that pushes might have to taste one make sure they're right mmm so good I'm just gonna pour them into the dough so this is a yeast dough and it's got currants soaked in rum throughout the dough I'm gonna let it rise one more time and then soak it so this is a really sticky down out and it's got all these currents and it's beginning to smell rum like okay they're nicely distributed and now we're gonna do is put it into the cooking off mold you can see the dough it's really nice and don't be surprised it's really wet and sticky it is like wallpaper paste it just sticks to everything I think I'm gonna new nice for this just spread it around evenly in the pan it doesn't have to be perfect so I'm gonna put a damp cloth back on it let it rise for about 50 minutes until it's about double in volume and then I'm gonna bake it at 375 for about 30 minutes gonna be great and now I'm gonna make the sugar syrup [Music] so my bobo room is out of the oven it bake for 30 minutes at 375 and I just let it cool for about 10 minutes 15 minutes until I can get it out of the pan this is the moment of truth whether in fact I've greased it enough perfect ah isn't that gorgeous I'm always amazed myself so now I'm going to do is make the rum syrup that soaks it's going to make it really good so the first thing you need is one and a half cups of water and a cup of sugar just cook this on high heat until the sugar dissolves you know I always thought that what this was originally a brioche that got stale and somebody said no let's just soak it in sugar syrup and see if it works and a little rum never hurts okay that was really fast I'm just gonna pour this into here okay and I have the 2/3 of a cup of all not just experimented a little bit usually the sugar syrup is that but I find that rum a little bit harsh and I found if I had a half a teaspoon of vanilla extra it just rounds out the flavour beautifully hmm smell that romema hot syrup and now I'm Justin very slowly pour it onto the cake so that it soaks in and you see it just absorbs all that gorgeous that's why you want the cake still to be warm when you do this and then afterwards I'm going to put a glaze on it to make it nice and shiny a little sweet and when it's serve the big mound of whipped cream in the middle mmm last bit of rum syrup into the cake see I taught it we all go in every master off okay now I'm going to make the apricot glaze so let me take pan apricot preserves on a spoon and just put about 3/4 of a cup of apricot jam into the pan about a tablespoon of water I'm just going to heat this all together and then sieve it so it makes a nice thin clear glaze okay let's just a six-second and then pour it right through the sieve okay most of my desserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion and it's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it we've got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just gonna brush it on the outside of the cake will believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake when I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose well when I wonder what table setter she's gonna choose Cassandra is not decided where she's going to have the rehearsal dinners so I'm going to give her two options a round table which is slightly more provençale more country like and this one which more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we are going to use this very nice needs of ivy we're going to create this nice little pattern in the middle that looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas so the second dessert I'm going to make for Cassandra it's called yo flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French Nursery dessert and I think she's going to just love it first thing I need to make his caramel sauce turn the heat on high really high so I've got a half a cup of water and one and a half cups of sugar and I'm going to cook it until it's a warm caramel brown color like a really rich color okay while that boils away I'm gonna start on the praline so I need one and a half cups of blanched sliced almonds you can find them in the grocery store know you can always smell this first it's just you can start to see the heat and just swirl it carefully this is incredibly hot don't touch it I'm just gonna turn it off I need a half a cup of water I'm going to add water and vanilla now this is the tricky part this is gonna bubble up violently so just stand back see what I need they need a heavy teaspoon of good vanilla extract and just stir this carefully and cook it until it's 230 degrees on a candy thermometer and it's going to be just the right consistency is going to be pourable when it's at room temperature and you can smell that wonderful caramel the sort of burnt sugar and vanilla can be delicious okay we're there 230 degrees so I'm going to take about a quarter of a cup of the caramel be really careful this unbelievably hot just drizzle it right over and the rest of the caramel sauce I'm going to save for drizzling over the ill Fatone so just mix this up together make sure the almonds are coated in caramel spread it out on the pan and I'm going to bake this 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes until the almonds are nice and brown and crisp and then I'm going to sprinkle that over the up float all and then I'm going to show you how easy the meringues are and they're just gorgeous [Music] so the next thing I'm going to make for Cassandra's ill float all is the islands or just meringue so I need eight egg whites at room temperature I'm going to say the egg yolks for making the custard right into the mixer okay I'm just going to put in a quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar that acts as a stabilizer for the egg whites and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and then turn it on high speed when it's nice and frothy I'm going to slowly add a cup of sugar advocate for the vanilla okay I'm going to do really messy mounds of this on two cheap pants lined with parchment paper good news about meringues is they're not supposed to be perfect sort of messy and organic looking this isn't like the hard meringues that you get that are like cookies these are gonna be really soft meringues melt in your mouth and because of the good vanilla they'll taste like vanilla clouds it's impossible to do this without getting it all over you and the kitchen into the oven 250 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're going to have meringues I think Miguel's starting to work on a second table setting I can't wait to see it [Music] in case that Cassandra wants something more informal I'm going to give her this second option which I'm calling it the province cell table and as you can see this is a weak color over cloth I decided to use very modern glasses for the water and stemware for the wine instead of having one centerpiece I decided to have three centerpieces I like this because it gives the idea it sort of emphasizes the idea of the round table so no matter where you look you have different flowers to look at round square I wonder which one she will choose the last part of my element is crema on glass so the first thing I need is 1 and 3/4 cups of milk and then once called it which means I'm going to heat it to just under the boiling point okay in the meantime I'm going to start making it's a very light custard so it's got egg yolks these are four egg yolks left over from making the meringues okay and then half a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cornstarch and open the milk is perfectly ready can see the bubbles around the outside and stuff before it's boiling actually it's easiest to pour it in if I poured in this and report in very slowly otherwise you end up with scrambled eggs first search isn't always used like these come-ons us but it acts as a stabilizer so it makes it easier to cook that's great okay now goes back in the pan I'm going to cook it over a very low heat until it's just slightly thickens this isn't like pastry cream which is very thick this is really a thin sauce and then after it's cooked I'm going to flavor it with amaretto and vanilla it's gonna be delicious so this is starting to thicken what it'll do is coat the spoon so a little bit more and be done perfect I'm gonna sit it just in case there are little particles and I'll know if there's anything cooked egg in it I think I just made it before it went too far look at that and I gorgeous okay one and a half teaspoons of amaretto which is almond liqueur mmm love the smell of that Khanh teaspoon of vanilla and because that's something to look like what it tastes like I think the seeds of half a vanilla pod next I'm going to assemble the El Fattah and make someone whip cream for the bubble aroma [Music] Cassandra's going to be here in a few minutes and I want to assemble the elf Lata and Baba au Rhum and time for her to get here first remember I made this wonderful creme on glass you can see the vanilla being specks in it going to make a puddle of it in the middle of this play and then meringue islands right in the middle okay a drizzle of caramel sauce I've allowed it to cool so it's nice and thick and caramel and the last part is the praline almonds that I made earlier just crack them in big shards right on top of the meringue and caramel it's like heaven and the Baba Rome nice flat green leaf it's going to be a tough choice for Cassandra I don't know what I would choose now I'm just going to fill this whole Center with whipped cream who wouldn't want to have that for dessert so these are the two desserts the first one is Baba au Rhum I took peas cake with currants that soaked in rum and of course it's filled with whipped cream okay and the second one is called a float tall which is a floating island as big meringues drizzled with caramel and then praline almonds sprinkled on the top so it's creamy on the bottom it's sort of light and fluffy in the middle and then crunchy on the top here's your test or you want to it fantastic okay Miguel you have to taste - you don't get a vote but you get a taste then only the bride gets a vote it was so much fun to make these what's they own I didn't tell you I'd make it easy for you so what do you think the decision is I think I like the floating island I do I'll do it okay but I have to tell you if you wake up at 3 and then where you go oh my god I chose the wrong one you can choose the other one yeah yeah oh I'm so glad Cheers another toaster to send an to Miguel for the tables so we have the purpose all table and then we have the urban table I think I like the Provencal yeah I have more of a hydrangea theme at my wedding and I think I love something a little dip I totally agree I think it's gorgeous tikkun yeah more desert I think we have to appeal flow Tom and Cassandra's on or right Cheers and their little tartar so I really like them and a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar it just has much more flavor just one tablespoon and just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just gonna soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling Ranma full okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so with the mixer on low speed I'm going to put in it first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't clump at the teaspoon of salt you always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft this is gonna make a really light dough put a little bit of the thyme and just let mix in okay perfect you can see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right now [Music] old damp towel and then pour it right through the sieve okay most of my deserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion and it's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it we've got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just gonna brush it on the outside of the cake will believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake oh no I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose when I wonder which table setter she's gonna choose [Music] Cassandra is not decided where she's going to have the rehearsal dinner so I'm going to give her two options a round table which is slightly more Provencal more country like and this one which more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we are going to use this very nice mix of ivy we're going to create this nice little pattern in the middle looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas so the second dessert I'm going to make sexy Sandra it's called yo flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French Nursery and add the two thirds of a cup of oil just experimenting a little bit usually the sugar syrup is that but I find the rum a little bit harsh and I found if I add a half a teaspoon of vanilla extra it just rounds out the flavor beautifully smell that rum the hot syrup and now I'm just going very slowly pour it onto the cake so that it soaks in and you see it just absorbs all that gorgeous that's why you want the cake still to be warm when you do this and then afterwards I'm going to put a glaze on it to make it nice and shiny a little sweet I'm going to serve it with a big mound of whipped cream in the middle last bit of form syrup into the cake see I told you it would all go in every last drop okay now I'm going to make the apricot glaze so take a pan apricot preserves on a spoon and just put

quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar that acts as a stabilizer for the egg whites and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and then turn it on high speed when it's nice and frothy I'm going to slowly

perfect sort of messy and organic looking this isn't like the hard meringues that you get that are like cookies these are gonna be real [Music] my friend Barbara lieth gorgeous daughter Cassandra's getting married this year and I've offered to help with the rehearsal dinner I believe in first impressions and last impressions so I've asked my friend Miguel to do two table settings for Cassandra to choose from and I'm making two over the top desserts first I'm making a Baba au Rhum which is a delicious cake made with yeast and then soaked and I mean soaked in rum syrup and second I'm giving her a choice with yo float aunt or floating island which is big mounds of meringue floating on a sea of vanilla creme anglaise and drizzled with caramel and pralines hmm Cassandra's coming later to choose which table setting and which dessert she wants for her rehearsal dinner I think it's really hard to choose so the first dessert that I'm going to suggest for Cassandra's rehearsal dinner is a classic French bistro dessert and it's called Baba au Rhum or a rum Baba and what it is is it's a yeast cake made with currants and it's allowed to rise and it's soaked I mean we're talking soaked with rum syrup and it's absolutely delicious I've been making bubble room for Geoffrey I think since we first got married and I thought the santur would love it for her party okay that's really well buttered now I'm going to start making the cake so the first thing I need is warm milk you need 1/2 a cup of milk heated to 115 degrees that's my ball is really cold you want to eat a little more but if you're not sure about 115 degrees use a thermometer for 1 packet of yeast in there's a little bit of a process but you can do it in advance and then soak it just before you're going to serve it so one packet of yeast and two tablespoons of sugar the sugar actually makes the yeast grow it's like food for the yeast I just stir it around and clean hands you can do with your fingers well it sit for about five minutes only you'll find is you'll see bubbles it's the carbon dioxide coming out of the knees and that's how you know it's alive alive and with it and in the meantime I'm going to soak the currants in rum mm-hmm that's really everything in this cake is soaked in rum so I need third of a cup of currants that's a really great they're like raisins smaller and they're little tartar so I really like them and a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar just has much more flavor just one tablespoon and just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just going to soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling away in the fall okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so with the mixer on low speed I'm gonna put in me at first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't clump at the teaspoon of salt you always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft this is gonna make a really light dough put in a little bit of the thyme and just let mix in okay perfect you gonna see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right now old damp towel just a kitchen towel just slightly damp towel you don't want it soaking wet just enough so the dough doesn't dry out while it's rising okay I think I hear Miguel he's coming to do two table settings for Cassandra and I know that both gonna be so beautiful she'll never be able to choose hi time ago thank you so much for doing this every rehearsal table needs a good stylist and you're it so I got you all kinds of things I got you flowers a sophomore rings they're melt in your mouth and because of the good vanilla I'll taste like vanilla clouds it's impossible to do this without getting it all over you and the kitchen into the oven 250 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're gonna have meringues I think Miguel's starting to work on a second table setting I can't wait to see it [Music] in case that Cassandra wants something more informal I'm going to give her this second option which I'm calling it the province style table and as you can see this is a weak color over cloth I decided to use very modern glasses for the water and stemware for the wine instead of having one center piece I decided to have three center pieces I like this because it gives the idea it sort of emphasizes the idea of the round table so no matter where you look you have different flowers to look at round square I wonder which one she will choose the last part of my elephant is creme on glass so the first thing I need is 1 and 3/4 cups of milk and I want to scold it which means I'm going to heat it to just under the boiling point okay in the meantime I'm gonna start making it's a very light custard so it's got egg yolks these are four egg yolks left over from making meringues okay and then 1/2 a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cornstarch and open the milk is perfectly ready you can see the bubbles around the outside and strips before it's boiling actually it's easiest to pour it in if I poured in this and the port in very slowly otherwise you end up with scrambled eggs first searches we've always used that you come-ons us but it acts as a stabilizer so it makes it easier to cook now looks great okay now goes back in the pan I'm going to cook it up a very low heat until it's just slightly thickens this isn't like pastry cream which is very thick this is really a thin sauce and then after it's cooked I'm going to flavor it with amaretto and vanilla it's gonna be delicious so this is starting to thicken what it'll do is coat the spoon so a little bit more and be done perfect I'm gonna sieve it just in case there are little particles or not know if there's anything cooked egg in it I think I just made it before it went too far look at that and I gorgeous okay why don't I have teaspoons of amaretto which is almond liqueur mmm love the small that teaspoon of vanilla and because I'll have something to look like what it tastes like I think the seeds of half a vanilla pod next I'm going to assemble that your foot tall and make someone whip cream for the bubble of Rome Cassandra's going to be here in a few minutes and we want to assemble the ill float on and Baba au Rhum and time for her to get here first remember I made this wonderful creme on glass you can see the vanilla bean specks in it going to make a puddle of it in the middle of this plate and then meringue islands right in the middle okay a drizzle of caramel sauce I've allowed it to cool so it's nice and thick and caramel and the last part is the praline almonds that I made earlier just crack them in big shards right on top of them away and caramel it's like heaven and the Baba wrong nice flat green leaf it's gonna be tough choice for this em I got plates and napkins and glasses I did two different Clause you can change anything you like and I'm glad through shapes yeah I got two shapes I thought it'd be interesting for a choice of chicks I've cooked me to do right now I understand you're doing Bubba wrong I am I'll see you and will will get to taste - what good so the Baba au Rhum dough has been sitting for a bed an hour and should be doubled in volume and it is perfect so the next thing I want to do is drain the currents these are soaked in rum fit their brushes might have to taste one make sure they're right mmm so good I'm just going to pour them into the dough so this is a yeast dough and it's got currants soaked and wrong throughout the dough I'm gonna let it rise one more time and then soak it so this is a really sticky down out and it's got all these currents and it's beginning to smell rum like okay they're nicely distributed and now we're going to do is put it into the cook of off mold you can see the dough it's really nice and don't be surprised it's really wet and sticky it is like wallpaper paste it just sticks to everything I think I'm gonna new nice with this just spread it around evenly in the pan doesn't have to be perfect so I'm going to put a damp cloth back on it let it rise for about 50 minutes until it's about double in volume and then I'm gonna bake it at 375 for about 30 minutes to be great and now I'm gonna make the sugar syrup [Music] so my bubbeh room is out of the oven and bake for 30 minutes at 375 and I just let it cool for about 10 minutes 15 minutes until I can get it out of the pan this is the moment of truth whether in fact I've greased it enough perfect ah isn't that gorgeous I'm always amazed myself so now what I'm gonna do is make the rum syrup that soaks it's going to make it really good so the first thing you need is one and a half cups of water and a cup of sugar just cook this on high heat until the sugar dissolves you know I always thought that what this was originally a brioche that got stale and somebody said let's just soak it in sugar syrup and see if it works and a little rum never hurts okay that was really fast I'm just gonna pour this into he cooked it and they have the 2/3 of a cup of oil not just experimenting a little bit usually the sugar syrup is that but I find that rum a little bit harsh and I found if I had a half a teaspoon of vanilla extra it just rounds out the flavor beautifully smell that Roma hot syrup and now I'm just being very slowly pour it onto the cake so that it soaks in and you see it just absorbs all that gorgeous that's why you want the cake still to be warm when you do this and then afterwards I'm going to put a glaze on it to make it nice and shiny a little sweet I'm going to serve it with a big mound of whipped cream in the middle last bit of rum syrup into the cake see I told you I'll go in every master huh okay now I'm going to make the apricot glaze so I'm tick pan apricot preserves - spoon and just put about 3/4 of a cup of apricot jam into the pan got a tablespoon of water I'm just going to heat this all together and then sieve it so it makes a nice thin clear glaze okay this does take 6 second and then pour it right through the sieve okay most of my desserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion and it's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it we've got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just going to brush it on the outside of the cake will believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose when I wonder which table centers she's gonna choose [Music]
