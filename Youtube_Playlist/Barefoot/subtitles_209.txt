it doesn't feel like summer until I do I got the grill even if it's raining I'm out there with my umbrella and usually a flashlight because it's dark grilling salmon and steaks so what could be more fun than meeting some friends at the beach for grill they're in charge of the fire I'm in charge of the food and unfortunately Jeffrey has to work so he's going to miss all the fun we'll miss you barbecued chicken you can't beat it everyone loves it some Szechuan noodle salad packed with crisp summer vegetables for color you know I always love something green with a meal broccoli with garlic and soy and then those coast to coast favorites some mores oh we have some great tips to returning plain old vanilla ice cream into a great desserts everything from just drowning an espresso the Italian way to serving it with fabulous fresh raspberry sauce I've a party to get ready for I better get going I'm always looking for new ways to cook chicken but nothing says some are more than cooking chicken on a grill and I'm going to marinate it in barbecue sauce the history of this barbecue sauce is pretty amazing years ago at Barefoot Contessa I asked the chef to make three different kinds of barbecue sauce so we could test them I thought well one should be sort of mustardy one should be tomato way and one would be maybe chinesey and I don't know when they came out one was to mustardy one was to tomato II and of course one was to chinesey so I took them home and I thought well let me play with a little bit and I took all three of them I dumped them in one pot and it was a fabulous barbecue sauce and that's what I've been using for 25 years so it's got a lot of ingredients but it's really worth making so what I've done here is I've sautéed one and a half cups of onions and vegetable oil with lots of garlic for about about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and then I'm going to add all these ingredients 1 cup of tomato paste just like one and a half of these small cans then one cup of cider vinegar it's good it's got some sweetness to it a cup of honey this jar is 16 ounces so I need about half and none if this has to be exact just close one cup of mustard I use good Dijon mustard this is 8 ounces so that should do it one cup of hoisin sauce which is the Chinese part of the recipe and horsin sauce is like a plum sauce it's very often used for duck and it's great in this and this jar is 8 ounces so it's just a cup that's the hoisin sauce and then 1/2 a cup of Worcestershire sauce oh I hate these little things that they put on the top so this is 5 ounces so I need most of this jar have a cup of soy sauce and all this can be just approximately just until it tastes great to you and then lots of great spices so I'm going to put in 2 tablespoons of chili powder it's gonna add lots of spice to it 2 tablespoons of chili powder not quite that much 1 tablespoon of cumin which is sort of a tex-mex spice like that and had the tablespoon of really hot red pepper flakes and you can make this as hot as you want but it's sort of hot but not really hot so I'm just going to simmer this for about 30 minutes till all the flavors blend together - bet Jeffrey has to go to work we know how much he loves chicken how I am about buying things for party rather than making them ice cream is a perfect example why bother making it I'd love to start with good vanilla ice cream lots of toppings and I end up with a dessert that everybody loves so I'm taking vanilla ice cream with great simple toppings it turns grown-ups into fun stirs it works every time I thought I'd make fresh raspberry sauce over vanilla ice cream it's four ingredients and it takes less than ten minutes to make how good is that so start by cooking the raspberries pour them into a pan half a pint of luscious right there is just the right amount and then the sugar half a cup now some water quarter of a cup in the pan turn off the heat okay so that's boiling now now lower the heat and let it simmer for four minutes so while that cooks pulling out a cup of raspberry jam what's seedless raspberry jam because the fresh fruit will have enough seeds in it then add to the bowl of the food processor that's been fitted with a steel blade now Framboise it's a clear raspberry flavored brandy that you can find in the liquor store so now pour in the raspberries and switch the Machine on once the sauce really smooth great that's perfect when you're ready to serve dessert just spoon some of the sauce over scoops of vanilla ice cream and I promise you everyone will be in heaven and no one will know that it took you just 10 minutes to me this house is also great with meringues it's wonderful for entertaining because you can make in a day or two in advance here's another idea and it couldn't be easier it's Italian it's called affogato it's a scoop of vanilla ice cream with how two spresso poured over it it's hot and it's cold it's absolutely delicious so first things first make the espresso everyone's got different machines you know how yours works I'm using one chair for example follow the instructions and the amounts for your machine but make sure you use espresso coffee or it won't be unduly authentic if you don't have an espresso maker you can just buy prepared espresso from a coffee shop and then just heat it up before dessert so get your ice cream ready when the coffee's hot pour right over the ice cream it's as simple as that mmm the mix of cold vanilla ice cream and piping hot espresso they melt together it's absolutely sublime well it's too early in the morning for ice cream but Jeffrey and I could definitely use a cup of espresso hi sweetie hi Watson coffee oh yeah thanks I can't believe you're gonna miss our party I know it's gonna be really fun we save me something yeah I'm having barbecued chicken your favorite oh my god save you some where are you gonna cook it on the beach of course oh I'm sorry you're miss having all that sand in you right that's it let's take the sand off okay can't wait to get to the beach everybody's there lighting the grill getting everything ready I'm just gonna marinate the chicken so just gonna put it in the bowl oh it's not chicken to make sure it's fresh oh so I'm just gonna pour some marinade over it one thing you want to do though is make sure it's cold I'm actually combine the chicken and the marinade overnight that's even better so I'm just gonna layer it all together smudge it all around is a technical thing smudge so that's the chicken of the marinade ooh cold okay chicken hands definitely want to wash these okay into the fridge with a chicken we're gonna have a great barbecue later perfect timing so to go with a barbecue chicken I'm gonna make Szechuan noodles sort of tex-mex meets Asian fusion so the first thing I do is cook the pasta naturally instead of using Chinese noodles I use Italian dry pasta really it sort of works better this is fettuccine you can use spaghetti any kind of pasta like that is just great this has lots of great ingredients but it also has lots of flavor first thing is 6 cloves of garlic all chopped up right into the food processor okay next thing is ginger this is what ginger looks like it's a very certain orally but what you want to do is with a sharp knife peel it and then chop it up it's got great flavor I need a better quarter of a cup chopped up okay just check this up sort of roughly it's going to get really pureed in the food processor so it doesn't have to be perfect chopped up nice okay about 1/4 of a cup into the food processor ok now all these things from the pantry most of them you probably already have half a cup of vegetable oil half a cup of tahini which is sesame paste sort of middle-eastern you can find it you can't find it in the grocery store you probably can you can certainly find in a specialty store okay have a couple have a cup of peanut butter I mean how bad can a sauce be if it's got peanut butter in it so then 1/2 a cup of this this looks like really good peanut butter half a cup of soy sauce this is really all the salt in it plus lots of other flavor Ryan and then quarter of a cup of honey that's a quarter of a cup let's see it doesn't have to be exact quarter of a cup of dry sherry this is from the liquor store that should do it quart of a cup of sherry vinegar mmm I love the smell that it's great in vinaigrettes - I should do it two tablespoons of sesame oil you don't want the clear one you want the one that smells like really roasted sesame seeds it's a dark sesame oil has so much flavor and now comes the heat I'm gonna add cayenne pepper just a pinch just enough to give it some heat Asian chili oil which is really hot whoa and some black pepper and that should do it that's it thick it looks so delicious I can smell the ginger and the garlic it's gonna be great but I think the pasta is ready just done okay oh I said hot ok I need all the sauce save them something later and then toss it together with the hot noodles it's actually great type of sauce on the hot noodles it really absorbs the flavor an apple is electro sauce because as the noodles cool or the pasta cools it's gonna absorb more sauce and now we're going to add some other great Asian ingredients slice scallions as much as you like yellow peppers red peppers so it's great because it's pasta and it's wonderful sauce and it's vegetables and it's going to be so good with barbecued chicken I think a little extra scallions I'll do it perfectly on this so I'm just slicing on the diagonal put right on top and that looks delicious ready for the beach you so my friends are at the beach I have one thing left to do broccoli with garlic broccoli is cooking away and what I've done is I've cooked garlic whole cloves of garlic in oil for about 15 minutes the garlic is a perfectly tender and then the oil is infused with a garlic flavor it's great you add a little heat to it some red peppers this is great for picnic and just put it in containers and everybody can eat it to the beach okay that's going to sit for a minute so the broccoli should be just about done just going to blanch it for about 2 or 3 minutes so it's really just tender but still crisp like a salad and it should be just done right now so it's going to go right into ice water I want to stop the cooking immediately it's called shocking it and what it's going to do is stop the cooking and also set the color so it's going to be bright green nobody wants to eat brown broccoli salad okay just for a minute until it's cool then I'm going to drain it and then put a sauce on turn it really well cuz when the broccoli is dry it will hold much more of the sauce okay right into a bowl and now what I'm going to do is just add some of the garlic oil a little bit of the oil tossed around it just enough to flavor it the whole cloves of garlic which are actually really sweet when they're cooked like this that looks pretty good and since we have an Asian thing going I thought maybe instead of salt I'd use a little soy sauce on it just a few tablespoons toss it all together and how easy is that already for the beach only when you go to a beach party and everybody's on their own blanket I don't feel like I'm at the same party I think it's so much nicer to all be together one big party so I've gone out and gotten some straw window shades all kinds of wacky things inexpensive pillows that I got on sale and and then we can all be together have the table in the middle and well really comfortable hey it's a great way to have a party so marinating this for a couple of hours but it's even better if you marry me for a couple of days and you don't have to cook the chicken at all before you know and just put it on the grill you know the key is not making sure that the grill is far enough away from the cold the outside doesn't burn before the chicken cooks the friend of mine sits on the barbeque until the fire department shows that this says wa noodles and broccoli I love the package yes where I got the Chinese takeout place perfect so shall I see it the chickens ready it's just cooking away here looking at this so you wanna have a hand up he needs our they put it right there plates napkin lots of napkins good math absolutely okay so one started I'm gonna double up big play it's beautiful smells really how'd I do anyone barbecue chicken with lots of napkins with the salt finger food okay another leg whoa okay and what we missing I like stars oh yeah okay that's a chicken that's great absolute is required okay time for some more I feel like a Pied Piper as in anything that large yells people of all you anywhere right that's true right okay I would've had to make some more any news no okay so we have graham cracker yes sharp and we have sticks you can just use regular stick so we have fancy sticks okay so everybody gets marshmallow do you do one or two heroes tonight okay I like that approach okay the two marshmallows on the fire oh this is Devon this one a look at this this is go that's great wait a minute I want some no turns out that Girl Scout training was really that's the only thing you learned in girls have been music oh right oh that's good wait come I got it all over my pants I'd say the s'mores are great it's not a picnic without the sand you know how much he loves chicken and how I am about buying things for a party rather than making them ice cream is a perfect example why bother making it I'd love to start with good vanilla ice cream lots of toppings and I end up with a dessert that everybody loves so I'm taking vanilla ice cream with great simple toppings it turns grownups into funsters it works every time I thought I'd make
