hi everyone welcome to my channel this is my first video and it's going to be about what my makeup looks like on a daily basis basically and yeah so hope you enjoy it okay so I've already washed my face with clean and clear daily face wash I think that's way cool and navy are to face some body moisturizer basically okay so once you your face is clean and moisturize what I usually do is go ahead and use a primer but I don't have any left unfortunately alone I use this from benefit to called pore fessional this is a good problem I'd recommend it um and yeah so first thing I like to do is put on my foundation and the one I use well the ones I use are Mac Studio sculpt in NC 30 and Rimmel wake me up in classic beige and why do is come on the back of my hand just a tiny bit literally like this much and then mix it with this one 1/2 a pump and some moisturizer because I find that if I just apply foundation straight onto my face it's a bit heavy and it's kind of cakey because I don't really have bad skin anyway and I don't really need to so let's pick some up about that much on the back of my hand and mix it together and once that's mixed I just use my finger and apply on my face okay once that's all on my face I use this Real Techniques sponge I don't know what this is called but yeah it's really good I love it I ditched everything and it is much cheaper than a beauty blender so why why not and why do you is I just dab up my makeup or for my for my foundation all over my face and once that is all on I just let my face sit for like ten seconds before I put on my concealer okay not that's done I go ahead and use my concealer and I use yes yeah Maybelline sorry packaging's come off but Maybelline Dream Lumi touch and I just apply that wait what color is this ivory yes apply that right onto my eyes in like a triangular sort of shape and I do use a lot of concealer and on the other eye down the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow and my chin and once again I use this sponge like the point yar and just to blend everything in then I just go ahead and use my Mac palette this is called Pro conceal and correct it's in medium deep i use this yellowy so it's shade here just apply a little bit under my eyes because I feel like this well this can see light it's a bit white and so I need to bring the warmth back to my face so I choose my finger time your belt in my eyes side and I feel like this just brightens up my eyes a little bit more - okay and once that is done I go ahead and bronze up my whole face and what I use for this is the bourgeois Paris bronzing powder that is what that looks like and this is in the shade 52 I just use a big fluffy fluffy brush this one's from eBay it came in like a pack of 16 like 10 pounds it's very very cheap and I still have them I've got them about four years ago I think actually really good so I do is to all my brush and runs are tap off any excess and just bronze or my whole face and bring it down to my neck look just so you're not like three different colors okay and once you have your desired darkness I guess what I do is go ahead and contour and for my contour i use the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit I love this it's actually amazing I use it for pretty much everything and the colors I use are is this middle gray Brown sort of color I really like this color because it's not as orange at the other two so it's more it looks more other shadow it is just a bit more natural and this darker Brown right underneath a highlighter shade and I use that with my Real Techniques setting brush I just mix those two colors together on my brush tap off any excess because they are very pigmented and just go right onto my cheek bone if you don't know where your cheekbone is just you can use your finger or a brush or whatever and there's like you feel like a hollow where it should be and that's where you want to contour some lines right here that's where I'm going to contour don't start contouring like right down your face because you have to have like a really obvious line and even if you bend at you it's just going to look crappy I'm just going to pick up my more products don't just slap a load on your face because you can't really work backwards so just start off small with small amounts and then just build off if you need to and I'll bring that up to my forehead a slightly I don't really need to call to my forehead because it's not really big I don't want it to look even smaller so I just tend to stay away from that this one muffled hood a little bit and then I bring it once again pick up more product on the excess and then just contour my jawline it seems sort of like a three shape if you don't really know where to contour do it in like a three and then just I just contour down line nose a little bit I'm just going to go ahead and do it on the other side okay so once your face is contoured how you want it I just go ahead and highlight my face and I use the hourglass highlights are in moonlight I this was literally the only highlighter found that doesn't have like bits of sparkle in it so it just kind of makes you glow into it I'm just shining if that makes sense so this is what that looks like and I use a fan brush also from Real Techniques I don't even tell but okay so I just take some of my brush once again tap of any excess and apply it just above my cheap on the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow and just on my chin so basically where you put your concealer just not on do you want your eyes if that makes sense you can put some just below your contour as well if you just wanted to make it stand out a little bit more so yeah that is what the height looks like okay so once you've done your highlight are I just go ahead and use my blusher and this one some golden rose it's in the number Oh - a lot of people have asked me what i use on my cheeks and is this so i just use this book is another brush will Murr Sal got from eBay and I just follow my lash on the blusher top of the neck dress and with this blusher you kind of half the top of the excess cause it's so pigmented and I apply that right where my contour is and on this side as well you don't need to pick up any more because it some people like to apply it here I find that putting it where my contour is just scoot my shape of my face better and it just looks nicer okay so once my face is done I go ahead and do my lashes um and I use two different mascaras I use lash sensational by Maybelline and Maybelline the falsies volume Express when it comes in scars I don't really waste my money on like Mac or benefit habla because I just feel like they work the same to be honest so there's claim and I use the lash sensational fast and I just kind of take off any excess just so it doesn't read clump up as much and then just apply that show it on to my lashes you can tell your lashes if you want what I just don't really need to ok so once my first layer of mascara is applied I go ahead I wait for it to just dry a little bit and then apply this one a lot of people do ask me on Instagram if I use fake lashes and what brand they are and blah blah blah blah that's all I don't really feel the need to use fake lashes because my lashes are long enough and the ridges really uncomfortable so once my mascara is applied I just go ahead and use my fingers to just rub off any excess on my eyebrows I don't really fill in my eyebrows on a daily basis because there's really no need to so once I done I just go ahead and just put a little bit of color on my lips than the one I'm using it's from Max Factor it is in the shade pink brandy eight to five and it's just sort of like a peachy color that's what that looks like I just dab it okay so once your makeup is finished and you're happy with what it looks like you can go ahead and say it you don't have to do this step it's just what I like to do because when I use powders and stuff I feel like it looks a little bit powdering I don't really like that look so I use the Mac prep and prime fix yet fix plus um I really like this I wouldn't use it if I had early skin because it does make you look a bit shiny that's what I like about it it just makes your face look washed rice and refreshed and stuff so what I do is I just spray that directly onto my face and you can spray how much you want to and I'm running out and just let that dry okay so this is what the final product looks like I hope you enjoyed if you have any video requests or any questions just give it down below and I'll see you in my next video like I would cut that it takes a while okay should I the end on it shows the different product please like and subscribe if you want to see more and you have any scores cancer
