hey guys welcome back so today I have eight get ready with me video so I'm just going to jump right in and start with my eyebrows today I'm using my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Pro palette and I'm using a Anastasio brush as well and I'm just going to lightly fill in my brows today we're going to be using all makeup geek shadows so taking the shade creme brul√©e we're going to take a blending brush by morphe brushes and we're going to apply this into our crease because this is going to work as our transition shade taking the Vegas lights palette I'm going to take the shade roulette and I'm going to apply this into my crease I am using a sigma brush as always I will list the name of it in the description box below and I'm going to apply this all the way into the inner corners of my eyes I do really like this palette I feel like it's super unique because I don't have any colors that are similar to it and make a peak shadows you guys know are really good and they're super affordable so I'm thinking about doing a video with just my favorite shades because there's so many but I have like a little small palette which is like twelve of my favorite top makeup peak shadows so if that's something that you guys will want to see just let me know and I will love to do it for you guys on my lid I went ahead and applied Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and then I'm using my Inglot gel 77 eyeliner as well as a morphe brush you so if you follow me on snapchat you probably already know that my boyfriend is another country right now so he was facetiming me and I was like I miss you I miss you so much but I'm filming right now and I kind of reminded me of when we were in high school used to play baseball and we had like a long-distance relationship for like months a really long time and it just brought back all those memories so I just found that kind of funny so it's just crazy how like small things bring back so many memories but I'm going away of topic so let's go ahead and keep on with the makeup tutorial for a foundation today I decided to use my makeup forever matte velvet in the shade 40 I know you guys say that this foundation is a little bit too light for me but you have to realize that the foundation does oxidize and I used to wear 53 I started wearing 53 because you guys said that it was a little bit lighter but then 53 started to oxidize even more so it looked really dark on my face and it just it just looked really bad so I'm going back to 40 I really like how it looks on my skin and I applied it with a simply spoiled cosmetics punch which I really like and then I'm going to go in and apply my concealer and my highlight using a morphe brush this new collection by morphe brush is not even being sponsored by them but it is amazeballs you guys it's so good it's so soft and it feels super expensive to set my t-zone and my under-eye concealer I'm using a a new palette by simply spoiled cosmetics and I'm taking the yellow shade with this morphe brush it's also part of their collection just look at it it's so freakin good and it's super soft you guys to contour today I'm going to be using my favorite palette and it's the two-faced shizzle to perfection contour kit and I'm using in your brush this is the NARS eater brush the infamous brush I do really like it I feel like I don't have anything that's like it just because the bristles are super soft I have heard of people say that there's have fallen out but my friend Amy told me if you washed it a lot that happens so I'm going to take a really good care of it now moving on to my hair I'm going to apply some dry shampoo as always you guys know I love dry shampoo and I'm working on second day hair my hair like I told you guys before is super oily I cannot control it and that's just something that I have to deal with so this dry shampoo that I've been using is called a mica and you can find it at Sephora it's really good it doesn't have any residue you guys saw when I sprayed it on my roots it didn't have any left over so that's something that I really like and it smells so good it actually smells like you just left the salon and your hair is freshly done except in reality it's all by the way how cute does Mark look he looks so freaking adorable and I took him to get a haircut today and he's just like he's feeling post-acute like I'm feeling myself home so I went ahead and applied an accessibility health liquid lipstick and turn Hollywood this will be always one of my favorites I just love love love this lipstick so today I felt like whitening my teeth and today I'm using a new set which I haven't used before but on the first try my teeth were like two shades lighter so I do really like it so what I like to do is I like to apply it in the container and then I put it in my mouth for five to ten minutes so if I have to put on any jewelry which I do like my watch my bracelets and actually these bracelets that I'm going to show you right now they're from luck always the website that you can customize bracelets necklace earrings just a whole bunch of stuff and just how adorable is it it has a DNC for Dianna Chantal and actually have the necklace as well which is super pretty if you haven't seen it on my snapchat you go see it right now just go see it for my nails today I'm just going to remove my nail polish and I feel like this is just magic in a bottle it removes it super fast and I'm just going to go with something nude because that's what I'm feeling right now and this nail polish actually mentioned in my last video which if you haven't seen go see it because it's a fashionable and I really like it it's called topless and barefoot by Essie and then moving on to my outfit and of course McAvoy always has to be in the video my shoes are
