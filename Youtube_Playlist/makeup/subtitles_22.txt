hi guys welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be a lip swatch and our review on the new colour-pop ultra matte lipsticks I'm so excited to be doing this video just because I picked these up probably about two to three weeks ago I did place one order in for four of them and then I went back to get three more just because I fell in love with them so these are what they look like I did get a variety I just dropped one did get a variety of like nudes and darks like that's all that I wear so these are the ones that I got I only have seven not a lot but I did get these with my own money I did want to share them with you guys just because I feel like they're gorgeous and you guys need to pick them up before I do get into the lip swatch of it I do want to go ahead and do like a review of these so these are only six dollars on the colour-pop website which is I think is a steal because liquid lipsticks these days range from like 14 to like 20 dollars so they're pretty expensive for just one of them before you can get like four of them for the price of one liquid lipstick from like Kat Von D Anasazi these are super super affordable and the quality of them is absolutely amazing the only other liquid lipstick I've ever tried is from Gerard cosmetics but I love the color pop once more just because they're cheaper and the formula is probably the same but better they last all day they don't crack on my lips and they have a variety of so much different colors I haven't tried anasazi au or Kat Von D or anything like that I feel like I don't need to because these were so affordable and the color range is amazing they have from nudes to pinks to Purple's to blues to a green one and from like vampy fall colors obviously from these that I have um yeah I just feel like they're super amazing they're so affordable you guys can just like get two of them try Mel and then go back and get as much as you want and the quality of them is absolutely amazing I they tend to be very drying but that's only cuz through the old trim mat so it's not going to exfoliate and moisturize before you put these on you're going to be good to go there's no problem I just think liquid lipsticks are like the best invention just because I like matte lips and I don't like anything that's gonna rub off throughout the day and these definitely don't rub off I kiss anything and nothing comes off like I'm rubbing it and nothing is coming off like these things are absolutely amazing like I said they're so long-lasting the color range is like out of this world I just think that you guys need to go get these out try them out there's nothing that you can lose of in like six bucks if you don't like it like they're so affordable they're long wearing I just think so much worth the money I just feel like they should be more than six dollars but they're not I'm glad for that but yeah I think I'm done rambling I really do like them and I recommend them to you guys I'm gonna have the link down below to the website so you guys can go and check them out but other than that let me fix my hair and then that I'm gonna go ahead and get into the lip swatches hope you guys enjoy this video I hope that you guys going buy them because they're super amazing I love them I can't wait to wear these dark colors for fall I love them but yeah you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in my next video Oh
