if you're bringing a foundation that's a little darker so now I'm gonna go ahead and bake my face the laura mercier translucent powder and I don't make my entire face the only parts that I bake or like she are under like great cheekbones so it looks really sharp I don't think under my eyes I just said it lightly with powder the reason for this is because I have dry skin I have dry skin so it looks really dry if I make my whole entire face so I like doing this step because it makes my contract really good deal so I thought you look a little bit crazy but it comes out good I promised and then I was like whatever is left on that sponge and I'll just go into my eye and said that and I don't want big my under eyes cuz it gets really dry there throughout the tape so I'll just lightly set it so while we are baking I'm gonna go ahead and contour I'm gonna use my own jasja contour kit and I'm gonna use a shade hook bottom and copper Brown with the morphe m-52 3 brush looks like this and I'm gonna take home oh I don't know start contouring but it's forming that line and some of your powder gets goes away you can just take that sponge and just apply more if you need take a brush I just bring my hair a little bit back and I blend it to them into my hair muscle looks very natural and whatever's left on the brush I'll bring that to my son boy to come to my nose I'm gonna use a little bit of Havana with the more feet m5 224 brush I'm gonna take that I'm just gonna follow my natural shape on top so I'm taking a little bit of copper Brown I'm putting that right here and it just makes your nose a little bit smaller is that that illusion I feel like I'm Adam take Ivana and I'm going to just go down a copper Brown and I'm just gonna go upwards click up up okay now imagine this BH Cosmetics a fluffy blending brush a little bit of hope on that anywhere who's gonna blend okay so now for highlighting I'm going to take my own associate lumineer there in Riviera and I'm doing a thorough techniques brush and I'm just applying this to the tip and then I was gonna go start a little bit higher and your high looks a little bit too bright or too stark whatever to go in with your powder brush and just blend that away now I'm going to use my chocolate Hill champagne pop I'm going to highlight really bright highlights why just applying it okay and then I don't you got real techniques brush I'm going to apply two hundred my brow bone now to slip away the powder I'm going to use my morphe geo brush with my mineralized skinfinish again I'm just going to go back and forth the skin so let's watch it for the face now we can burn the eyes the eyes are really simple but before we work on the eyes I'm to use my assignment rising miss from Kevin to fun ba not sure I pronounced out but for someone I'm moisturizing mist I just go away so I really like to have Lea platic it's very moisturizing and it feels really good on the skin so uh now you can work on the eyes so for me I'd like to keep it really simple it really depends where I'm going but if I'm gonna go to the store are gonna go out somewhere really casual I'll go in with I didn't come from skip right here and I'm gonna use my shirt help with landing brush and I'm just gonna go in the otterby the outer corner and I just blend this so my eyes have a little bit of color and then I'll mix it in with some saddle or a saddle from Mac and I'll just plug that into my crease and that I'm going with my morphe one is this the my 1 9 brush going a little bit of embark and I'm going to put on my lid and then I'm going to the same sheriff you're blending brush and I'll just blend in bark out asked for highlighting I'll go in with all that glitters from math and I'll apply it out into the outer corner and sometimes I'll even apply that onto the lid I'll just do that right now so today so usually I apply some false lashes but today I keep it simple and just add mascara so I'm gonna curl my lashes with this wash color I'm not I like with shopping you store for mascara I love to use this mascara this is from Mac and it is called false lashes extreme Vlad unfortunately it's not waterproof so I think I might need a purchase but in water provided we know if they sell this and waterproof fighters like those so I just will go back pretty much it and now I'll just usually apply some lipstick this is resistance from not been loving the shades on so that's pretty much it of my everyday makeup routine it's pretty simple it's pretty quick I feel like um but yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video and I will see you guys on my next one bye guys
