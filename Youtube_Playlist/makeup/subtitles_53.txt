hey guys so today's video is going to be on this make a tutorial it's like a 2p silvery cool tone look out of my comfort zone a little bit but I think it's so pretty it's also really suitable for prom I feel like if you're wearing a topi dress or like a purple dress this would look really pretty I like it so much and I hope you do too if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching my friends so I'm going to start out by priming my eyelids using Mac's painterly Paint Pots get rid of all those veins on my eyelids and to prime them of course I'm going to go into this Tarte tartlets palette right here and on this zoeva brush I'm going to dip it into the color free-spirit and basically what I'm doing is just kind of setting the base I put down so it's not sticky then I'm going to go back into the palette and I'm going to dip a fluffy blending brush into the shade natural beauty this is like a really light babi purpley gray color so it's perfect as a transition shade so that's what I'm using it for I'm just buffing this back and forth into my crease so that all the other eyeshadows that I put down on my lid blend nicely into the crease if that makes sense then with a more precise blending brushes from zoeva but it's just like a Mac 217 I'm going to dip it into the shade best friend this one is a lot more purple it's basically just like a mid-tone like matte purple color everything in this palette is matte by the way and so I'm just applying this to the outer V of my eye and it's bringing it into my crease I'm going to take this josie maran watercolor eyeshadow in the shade is out pink and i'm going to apply this to my lid using the little sponge tip applicator and then I'm going to blend it out with my finger it's like a really concentrated metallic pigment so I'm just taking my ring finger and just blending it out then for my favorite part I'm going to take this pigment from makeup geek in the shade nightlife it's a beautiful like to see like champagne with like a topi undertone no it's really gorgeous on the lid and I'm going to apply this all over my entire lid up to the crease to intensify that pigment a little bit more I'm going to take mac fix+ and I'm going to spray my brush with it and then dip it back into the pigment and this is just really really going to intensify the eyeshadow it's going to make it more metallic and bring out like the topi undertone a lot more and then I got out of the frame a little bit but basically I just put it in my on my entire lid you get the gist going back into that tartlet palette I'm going to zip it right back into best friend and I'm gonna apply this right into the crease and I'm using a very very precise like pointy blending brush it's kind of like a pencil brush and I really want a lot of the purple to be concentrated into the crease so that's why I'm using a pencil brush I'm just taking my time going back and forth and yeah after I do that I'm just going to blend everything out so there are no harsh lines so I'm taking that fluffy blending brush again Sigma e-40 and I'm going to dip it right back into natural beauty and then I'm just going to buff everything out into my crease I wanted some more purple in my crease but I didn't want it to look harsh I'm not I didn't to a cook crease or anything I just want everything to look nice and diffused and blown out then I'm going to take this shade called supermom and this is gonna be my highlight it's like a very like a light light light peachy pinky kind of color and it makes it a really nice matte highlight under the brow bone and I'm gonna take this Milani eye tech perfection liquid liner in black and I'm gonna start doing my wing the way that I really like to do it is I apply a super super thin layer as close to my lashes as possible and then I make it figure as I go so I just make the base really really thin and then just start you know making the way.you thicker but then I get out of the frame as per usual and that went across I'm gonna take this NYX gel liner in black the new like tres Jolie ones they are my favorite black eyeliner from the drugstore as of right now and I love them so I'm just going to tightline with it and then I'm just going to go ahead off-camera and apply my Ardell with these I'm gonna finish off I'm gonna start my face before finish off my eyes I'm priming my face using a makeup forever HD primer and then I'm going to go in with the Bourjois healthy mix serum foundation usually I would go for like a more full coverage Foundation especially for prom but my skin was acting super sensitive and I wanted something that was like light weight on my face like I wanted my foundation to be a little bit more lightweight so that's why I'm using my favorite which is the Bourjois healthy mix serum I'm in the shade 52 so I'm just applying that all over my face using a real techniques buffing brush and then with a real techniques like powder brush I'm going to go into the bourgeois healthy balance powder and I'm just going to powder my face a little bit staying away from my under-eye area specifically because I'm going to go in with concealer next and I'm using it the Maybelline master conceal by face studio and on a Real Techniques contour brush I'm applying that underneath my eyes and then I'm just going to blend it up something weird lends it out blend it out yeah so I'm just blending that up I also puts them on the bridge of my nose and on other parts of my face to highlight with the concealer I'm going to be setting that with Mac emphasized powder this is a really nice brightening powder and it's good to set your under eyes if you want like a bright under-eye effect which I do especially for nighttime or going out I love the under eye to be nice and bright now I'm going to go ahead and finish off the eyes I'm taking a sigma pencil brush and I'm going to dip it into natural beauty and I'm going to start smudging that on my lower lashes by the way I filmed this tutorial literally at 3 o'clock in the morning so that is why my eyes are so red I was dead tired but I really wanted to get this video for you guys cuz you know I didn't have a video up on Wednesday and I just wanted a video up but anyway I did that same pencil brush into the shade a best friend and I'm smoking it out even more then after that I'm going to add some of that same eyeliner from NYX to my waterline just to make it nice and deep on the lower lash line then I'm gonna take the super dark purple in this palette and it's called bombshell and I'm gonna really smoke it out again with that same pencil brush and then I just applied some mascara and then I am done with the eyes so moving on to the face I am taking my girl lactic bronzer in the shade Cobo this is my favorite bronzer of all time and I'm using the Real Techniques multi-tasking brush to just run up my face for some reason my bronzer was kind of washed out on camera but like I had like an intense bronzing contour action you just couldn't really tell that much yes so I'm just contouring kind of and bronzing at the same time for blush I'm using this Tarte one called celebrated it's like one of their new blushes and it is beautiful I love it it's a very very soft pink I'm not crazy for blush like a nun intense lush look so this soft pink is so perfect with so many looks and then I'm going to highlight my face using the Physicians Formula if I could open it up there you go shimmer strip in Miami strip my favorite highlighter of all-time drugstore high-end it's my favorite and I'm just highlighting with I believe this is zoeva like tapered highlighter brush and the brush I used to apply my blush was a Mac one like the Mac blush brush but yeah then I'm going to go ahead and finish off this look by doing a little lip combo here and my little lip liner broke a little bit this is a a colour-pop lippie pencil in the shade skimpy and I'm just applying that to my entire lip but then I thought it was way too warm for this look so I'm going in with this NYX high voltage lipstick in the shade stone it's such a cool unique like beautiful nude because it has a lot of great it I don't know it's really really pretty but yeah that completes this makeup look thank you guys so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already
