so this week's video is going to be all about how to do winged liner I literally get requested for me to do this video every single day on my Instagram so if you haven't noticed I did get my hands on a new camera super excited because I will be uploading videos every Monday um before we get started with this tutorial I just first wanted to tell you guys a couple of things before we get started um I'm not going to lie to you I'm not gonna I don't want to edit this video too much just because I want you guys to see the raw footage on how it is exactly how I do my winged liner because I trust me I've watched literally every eyeliner tutorial that exists here on YouTube and for some reason I just like they cut things and you know you don't know what it is that they do on their off camera you know what I mean so I tried to make this video as short as possible to get straight to the point but not cutting off certain things that you don't see on camera or off camera I mean another thing is that just keep in mind that you're the one in control of the makeup the makeup doesn't control you just be really patient it's just makeup it comes right off another thing don't try to attempt to doing liner on a day that your going to go out because if it doesn't come out right your going to be really upset you're not going to want to go to the damn party so I just say that from experience because that happened to me every single time so just try to do it when you have time at night when you're on Instagram or whatever another thing is that what might work for me might not work for you so you know if you like to do a gel liner then do gel liner if you like to do liquid liner then do if you like to certain brush just don't let this video influence you you know you you can't really you know everyone has their own little rituals like let me tell you like what I first started learning how to doing lighter like it was it was horrible like I would literally have to turn on every light turn off my music lock the door and praise the eyeliner gods like eyeliner gods like really like that doesn't even exist but that's that's what I had to do like the struggle is real also you don't have to splurge on products it's not how much you spend on the product it's how you use it so just be patient and there's no such thing as perfectly lawyers what I'm trying to say you can be really good at it but you know when you're done with it one might look longer one might look shorter should just learn to accept the fact that there's no such thing as perfect wing liner one is going to look a little different than the others just keep that in mind don't get frustrated and maybe maybe it will help you pray the eyeliner gods I don't know just try in my work so I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial if you have any requests for me to do any other videos please leave them in the comments down below with that being said I hope you guys enjoy this I will see you guys next week so the first thing you want to start off with is obviously an eyeliner brush this is my personal favorite to use and it's a 210 by Mac the gel liner that we're going to be using today is the Maybelline black gel liner I love this because it is super cheap and it only retails for eight dollars versus the mac cosmetics one which retails for about 18 to 20 I believe we're going to be using this brush today to clean up the wing of our winged liner I believe elf has a dupe for this one that retails for a dollar as well also going to need some concealer or you can also use foundation to help clean up the edge last but not least you're going to need some brush cleaner or here as I am using some alcohol this is ninety percent alcohol and a little rag to help clean up your brush in between you so before I start what I like to do is scoop out some of the product with my brush and then apply it on the back of my hand the back of my hand is going to help heat up the product so the eyeliner just goes on a little smoother and then I like to twist my brush with in the product to help get the point on the brush so the lines come out thinner and much more precise so before you start just go ahead and use your eyebrow as kind of a guideline from where to start your line and then where to end it so I like to do both of my eyes at the same time that way I can get it as evenly as I possibly can what I forget to you like and so inside and then I like to start forming a line from the inner corner of my eye towards the middle I like to do little sections at a time and if you notice there are little bumps in between don't get frustrated when this happens because I know a lot of you tend to get really frustrated just take your time and then we can go back in with the tip of the brush to even out the line so the moment you start to feel that the product and your brush is starting to get stiff go ahead and use that alcohol or brush cleaner that I told you to clean in between uses this is key when doing your winged liner because if you keep tugging at dry gel liner you're gonna get a lot of those little bumps and it's going to be much harder to fill it in later if it's not gliding on if that makes sense I'm turning see so what you're pretty much doing is just creating a normal gel liner without the wing and then after we do this part we're gonna go ahead and connect it when doing this part just keep applying more eyeliner because sometimes when you use shimmery eyeshadows it tends to make the eyeliner appeal appeal appear a little bit gray so just go ahead and keep applying the product to get it as black as possible massaging me I'm late ok so now we're going to go ahead and connect the wing you can start connecting it either from the beginning or from the end just just depending on how dramatic you want it you can add a little curve or you can go straight it all depends on personal preference and then after you connect it you can just go ahead and fill it in and yeah it's it's not that hard guys it just it just takes practice I promise keep practicing in your will get better Oh so I'm going to do the other side um if you notice they don't look exactly the same but you just kind of have to keep pulling with it if one looks thicker than the other then go back to the other side make it a little bit thicker but what I love about this is that once you grab your concealer in that flat brush you can make the point even point here you can elongate it and then you just pretty much drag it downward and after you apply your foundation it's going to blend in um later so yeah this is pretty much how I do my winged liner if I ever do decide to change my routine I will be sure to update you guys in another video umm yeah with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I hope it has helped you please tag me in your pictures on Instagram if you do attempt to do this and I will see you guys all next week me I'm late okay
