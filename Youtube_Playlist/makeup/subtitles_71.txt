hello cookies it's Siri I'm back and today I'm going to show you this Karrueche Tran inspired makeup look and the thing is it's people on instagram who told me that I looked like her and I was like really okay well she's so super beautiful and I've never ever thought that I looked like her so it's like well I might do a makeup look inspired by one of her photos just for fun and this is what I came up with first I'm applying my next photo loving primer all over my face then Mike and c42 foundation that I'm dabbing all over the face again onto the light concealer I'm applying it as I usually do and I'll put a link somewhere here guys if you want to see my usual highlight contour when I go for full highlighting and contouring up to the dark part of the concealer basically I'm doing it differently so I'm making my nose much bigger and I'm ending it under the eyebrows which I usually never do and then on the forehead I'm doing this line up here that I usually don't do a verbal I'm just trying to more or less match the facial structure she has on that photo a little bit of powder of course to set everything in place and then I'm doing the eyebrows so for the eyebrows I just watched her tutorial and I'm following the way she does it so I'm just feeling under the eyebrow first and here I'm actually doing a longer brow because she's doing her brows much longer than I usually do so I'm just dragging it a little bit more like so and then I'm just basically filling the eyebrows in here I'm starting to frown not because I'm pissed but more because I see that she also has much sharper eyebrows so by frowning I can see where it should be sharper on top there this is a step that I usually never do but I can see on the food that she has some foundation or concealer going on under her brow and over the eyebrow to highlight it and make it more clean I guess so that's what I'm doing now I'm just taking some foundation and a concealer brush from Ferris cosmetics and yes within my edges lumineer shadow primer that I'm applying all over my lids BH Cosmetics eyes on the 80s palette and I'm taking this warm brown color that I'm applying on the crease next I'm taking this champagne cutter that I'm applying as a highlight under my eyebrow now I'm taking black heart from my Naked 3 palette and I'm just dabbing it all over my eyelid then I'm curling my eyelashes with this torture device Maddy Ostrow favorite mascara of course darks one of them mark lashes that are perfect because they're slightly longer at the edges Casa Vega products had a primer on the tip of my nose and then this is something that I usually don't do it on the chin and on the forehead but I can see that on the photo she has some glow going on on these areas as well so that's what I'm trying to reproduce and then of course on my cheekbones which I kind of always do the highlighter itself Adam Devine on the forehead on the tip of my nose on my chin on my cheekbones basically everywhere will have the primer onto the lips I'm just grabbing some random warm brown lip liner and I'm lining my lower lip the same as I would usually do so just physically lighting it with the brown liner and then my upper lip I'm trying to make it much smaller so I'm lining inside my natural lip shape because I can see on the photo that she has a smaller smaller upper lip and a bigger lower lip and then has a beauty nude with a hybrid lipstick that I really love along dressed up in everywhere and as you can see I drew lines with the brown lip liner on my bottom lip to accentuate the effect of a bigger bottom lip compared to the smaller upper lip I'm just using some regular powder as a bronzer because I don't think I own any bronzer really and if I were to bronze I'd rather have a matte one and I never bronze but I can see as well on the photo that she's using a bronzer so I'm just taking a darker powder that is Matt Andres bronson everywhere and this is basically the final look I usually never pose in my videos because I'm not really good at that so bear with me but I'm doing it this time because I really want you guys to see how the makeup looks like and yeah that's about it I hope you liked it thank you so much for watching I hope you kids enjoyed this video if you did please give me thumbs up and subscribe if you don't want to miss all the upcoming videos and let me know the comments down below as well what do you think about people say that look like Karrueche because she's like super beautiful she has a really nice facial structure and we just don't have the same facial structure of this that's what I think and my boyfriend said the same thing so that you know the comments down below if you agree if you disagree so that I know and until next time see you cookies at the next video bye
