hey guys and welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be showing you how to achieve this kylie jenner inspired a makeup look she will this look to the golden glow boards and I just absolutely love it so if you guys do want to see how I achieved it and just keep on watching so I'm gonna start off by priming my eyes using some concealer this is the Maybelline age rewind concealer and I'm just applying it all over my eyes and blending it in with a brush just so that it's evenly blended and it can act as a base for the eye shadow we're gonna be using the eye shadow palette I'm using today is the morphe 35o palette and I'm gonna be taking this warm beige shade first of all and we're gonna be taking this on a blending brush and applying this as our first transition shade not only is this nice and light and will help all the colors we're gonna be applying after this blend evenly but it's nice and warm I definitely notice that Kylie's look did have a nice amount of warmth and bronze enos in it next I'm going to be taking this warm brown yellow toned shade from the palette and we're going to be applying this deeper within the crease to start building up more of that warmth in the crease and also to start building that definition and almost a little hint of smokiness in the crease Kylie's local really wasn't that dark but we do want to apply a little bit of a dark brown to really give it that nice amount of smokiness so I'm applying this with a slightly more pointed brush to really focus this color on the crease area and I definitely did notice that this color did come quite high above the crease so I do want to start bringing a little bit higher than we usually would above the crease area I do also want to be applying this into the outer V area as well to prepare it for the dark brown we're gonna be applying next taking this dark brown shade from that same palette I'm gonna be applying this on the outer V and we want to start booting up that smokiness like I said this is the darkest color we're gonna be applying it's a really soft dark brown it's nothing too harsh or too black in a sense it doesn't look like a black Brown so this just makes it look like a really soft and effortless smokey eye and you do want to again take it up quite high above the crease but you make sure to blend the edges as much as you can again go back into this color as many times as you need to to make sure that that color is nice and opaque in the crease I'm gonna be wiping away these sides of my eye because I did notice that kylie's I was nice and straight and then I'm gonna be taking this a bronzy shade from the palette and applying it onto the center of my lid and then I am taking another gold shade and applying it more onto the inner corner of my lid this just gives it a little bit more brightness towards the inner corner and I could definitely see that Kylie's lid was quite shimmery next I'm gonna be taking some natural false lashes just because I do feel like Kylie was either wearing just mascara or really really natural false lashes so I did want to kind of recreate that look but I don't have really long lashes to begin with so I'm taking these lashes from a makeup addiction I'm just applying them to my top lash line and also applying some mascara to make them blend in a little bit better to my natural lashes next I'm just gonna be priming my skin using my Too Faced hangover primer and I'm just applying this all over my skin just to give my skin a nice amount of hydration before foundation and the foundation I'm taking is the ex1 invisi wear and I'm just blending that in with this morphe kabuki brush and I really like this kabuki brush it's from their new elite collection I'll have the numbers listed down below as always but it's just a really nice brush blended everything in flawlessly I'm also just gonna be highlighting all the areas I would like to bring forward and also conceal so I'm just highlighting under my eyes onto my forehead and also onto my chin and I'm just gonna be blending in at those concealer areas using this littles away about kabuki brush I'm now just sitting my face using my soap and glory instant retouch of powder and I'm just using this new brush I am obsessed with it's one of the more feet elite collection brushes as well and it just set my face so beautifully I will list again the numbers of all the brushes and products down below as always but this brush in particular is just my new obsession I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows off-camera but I will link my tutorial down below next I'm just gonna be taking this brown eyeliner and applying it to my waterline and also applying it onto the bottom lashline I'm just gonna be smudging this out and diffusing it with some of the eyeshadow we used on the outer V of our eye we want this to look nice and smoky but we don't it to look overly harsh so using this brown eyeshadow we'll just diffuse it so there looks nice and blended on the bottom lashline I'm gonna be bronzing my skin now using this shade from the shade and light palette from Kat Von D when it came to Kylie's skin it looked really nice and glowy but it didn't look contoured or overly sculpted so I'm just applying this bronzer with a big Brush in the areas where we would usually contour this will just lightly sculpt the face while still giving us that really nice glow that just surrounds the perimeter of the skin and now I'm just using this bronze highlight from Bobbi Brown and just applying it onto the tops of my cheekbone to finish off and give us that gorgeous glow to finish off the look I'm just gonna be applying some stripped-down lip liner from Mac this is just a nice neutral Brown and I'm just applying it all along my lip line to give us that nice amount of fullness and to really define our shape of our lips next I'm just gonna be applying this lip lacquer from Rimmel just to give it that really nice creamy nude lip I'm just gonna be blending the end with my finger and because it was a little bit too light I just went on top of it with these stripped down at lip pencil and just ran it all over the lips to give it a nice Brown time
