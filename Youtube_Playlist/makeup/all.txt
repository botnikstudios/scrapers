hey guys it's Amanda I'm you Samuel make a by Samuel on Instagram so he did this whole glam look on me and it looks amazing so he's gonna show you how you can do this so we're putting on moisturizer and this moisturizer is by benefit and we're just gonna apply it with a brush all over her face wait for it to soak in yes how long does it take um I usually wait like 10 20 seconds I'll soak in real quick since I use a lot of powders I like to use a lot of moisturizer cuz at the end it ends up looking like skin and not like so much makes sense when I try to use powders underneath my eyes and like wherever I highlight yeah it's like really dry yeah so the foundation we're gonna be using is by Makeup Forever HD in 1:20 and I chose a color that's a little less lighter because I kind of want to give her a little tan and then later we're gonna blend it in with a Beauty Blender so Amanda actually has really great skin tan Hey has that anybody else for you to set I think in the first video that I've done like this oh also I mean I'm like done fun videos in the video okay so it's like yeah I'm gonna start blending blending is key so now we're just gonna close you a screw brush a little foundation your eyelids so how long does it take you to edit a video it depends on what kind of video if it's like one where I'm just sitting down talking that's it's like 30 minutes oh wow but if it's something like this will probably take a while yeah so the concealer I'm going to be using is by Dior and this is the Dior nude concealer and we're gonna start highlighting her face let's make sure you apply it really good and then a little on her lip on her chin Amanda honestly doesn't need this much makeup but this is glam so a while and then we're gonna go with our Beauty Blender and just blend now I like my Beauty Blender to be damn it helps with the blending to use your Beauty Blender wet or dry yeah I mean I use it wet when I'm blending but then I also use it dry for like powder and see I like it when it's wet for powder under the eyes yeah so just make sure you really blend everything I usually cream contour but on Amanda we're going to use a powder contour what's the difference with the effective well powder is going to give you more of a softer look versus cream that's going to give you more of a really contoured look so the powder I'm gonna be using is Laura Mercier and I'm just gonna set the under-eye area this is going to prevent it from creasing and also it's gonna act as a shield for when we do your eye shadow so I'm gonna take some of that powder and I'm just gonna lightly set it under her eyes we're just gonna softly blend it down what's your favorite sushi place no boom I love Nobu so now I'm gonna start studying her face and for that I'm gonna be using Laura Mercier translucent powder and then I powder I'm gonna get a little spun sugar this circle right and we're just gonna set under her cheekbone and what this is going to do it's going to help when we contour it's going to give her more of a defined cheek row I don't know lip highlight and then the rest of the face I'm going to set it with laura mercier so I'm going to take a studio gear brush and I'm just I put the laura mercier on my hands we're just gonna Pat it I did her makeup for the VMAs and we were there for a while but it looked really good after we're just gonna softly blend these lines as well so now we're gonna contour and that I will be using Milani Soleil number 5 I'm just gonna go lightly with it I'm gonna lightly contour so what I like about this bronzer is it has shimmer and it looks so beautiful when it's like photographed or whenever you're being filmed or just you know whenever you're outside it just hit the Sun hits it really nice or ahead a bit so sometimes I like for my clients to smile smile a bit so we're gonna make Amanda look like she just came back from the tropical island so now we are going to do her highlight and the highlights gonna be like the top of her cheekbone connecting to her brow bone and for that we're gonna use anastacio Beverly Hills star light illuminator it's my favorite oh I was just looking at that that I wanted to buy it so pretty so I just like blending it together with the contour so you guys can see it's like really highlighted so we're gonna start filling in her brows so you're gonna brush her brows up and we're gonna start filling it so I like more of a softer brow just going to brush it blend it really really really good after I'm going to get a little concealer the same concealer that I use we're going to clean it up same thing with the other eye and let so now we're going to move on to eyes so I'm going to be using a blush by anarse it's called orgasm right yeah so this is going to be your base I love using my blushes as eyeshadows sometimes the outcome it doesn't look like you have like blush on your eyes or anything like that so now I'm gonna use the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills Miami eye palette and I'm going to use this fresh peach color right here so the next color I'm going to use is by NARS it's called surabaya and I'm just going to take a flat brush and apply it to her lower lash line and we're going to blend the same palette we're going to use the second color other eye is the blender what I'm gonna do is I'm going to apply a highlight in the center of her eye right here and it's gonna be the same on associa Beverly Hills highlighter this is just gonna give her a pretty sheen when she closes her eyes so now to highlight in the inner corner of her eye we're going to use so Hollywood bionis hacia Beverly Hills so now we are gonna just do a few kiss softer colors under her eye and I'm gonna be using that same Anastacio palette and I'm gonna be using in caramel and Sienna mixed with a little bit of fresh peach I'm gonna take the same blush that I used on her eyelids and I'm just gonna softly smudge it under her eyes we're gonna move on to the eyelashes we are gonna curl your lashes this is my favorite mascara it's by L'Oreal carbon black what's your favorite mascara I really like the better than sex it's a good one I could coat the lashes really well so the eyelashes I'm going to be using today are Lily lashes the style is NYC they will like last you have to like 30 times yeah it's really good perfect going to use this Dior bronzer with my finger that's just going to make her lips pop so I'm going to be using this lip liner by Makeup Forever or C then I'm going to go with the lighter tone draw cosmetics serenity so now we're going to blend in all these contouring lines and powder so now we're going to dust off the powder that we left under her eye now we're going to merge the lashes together okay let's do the bottom mascara of mascara under the eyes because then later on I'm gonna blend it in so I'm gonna be using this facial sprite to set her face I go in with this stuff so you're gonna let it soak in for a bit so we're done

just getting beginning on makeup and some people that are you know kind of a little bit more skilled so yes let's just get right into this video yeah so I am starting out with my Pierre minerals primer and it's our foreign one illuminating primer and just getting priming my face with that and then I'm going to take my infallible and cover effects foundations and mix them together to cover up my skin right now I am breaking out like crazy I don't know why I think it's my hormones when I get my period TMI but when I got a period it just goes crazy my face just wants to have like a party of zits on it so annoying but anyway I'm gonna take that and blend it all together then use my cover FX concealer palette and I'm using the lightest shade in that palette to highlight under my eyes I am also doing a collab with one of my good friends Nicole Marie Lyon and I will put her YouTube channel down in the description box below she is also doing a back to school makeup look as well so definitely check her out she has great great tutorials great YouTube videos and I think you guys would really like her so definitely check her out in the description below so I'm going to take my NYX high definition setting powder I mean finishing powder sorry and set my highlight with that and I'm using a Beauty Blender to set that as well and I finally got a Beauty Blender I love it so much it just works amazing I'm using the NYX control-freak clear brow gel and just going over my brows to get them in shape I need to then go over them with my Beauty bakery dip brownie dip I can't even remember oh my gosh yeah and go ahead and shape my brows with that highlighting contour palette from cover FX using that lightest color and just pulling under my brows to just give them a little bit more shape and look at them make them look more clean and nice and neat so I'm gonna take my NYX highlight and contour palette meets a brown color to contour my face and just add a little bit more definition and not using too much just a little bit just to bring some more this step is totally optional you don't have to do it I know some people don't wanna look too made-up but I like this step it just brings more like to the face I'm gonna use this cover FX illuminating powder and just go over my highlight and contour all over my face I know some of these products are a little bit more pricey you can definitely use low end products to still get the same look it's not very hard but yeah I just wanted to bring more warmth to my face because I got a little tan and it just will match all over my body reaching back into my NYX palette I'm taking the same color that I use my contour with and I'm going to put that in my crease and creating a little bit of a cat eye but not really so much and then I'm going to use my gosh forgetting words forgetting things uh I'm using my forever 21 palette that color I just showed you and I'm putting it on my lid so I'll be taking my Ultra pearl mania from NYX as well and using that as my highlight and as you guys can see it just oh my gosh it just makes the whole look come together and just brings more life to your face girl just makes you glow yes I love it so much and I'm taking a blush from firm 21 it is a peach color I think it looks like 4 bucks and just put it on my cheeks and then going ahead and blending those about blending that together with my fan brush so now I'm just going to set all of that with my mac's fix+ I'm not finished yet though I'm going to use this mascara from wet and wild and put it on my lower lashes and my top lashes you guys can stop some of you if you want you can stop at this step and not add lashes or you can add lashes which I will be doing at the end of this video adding some lashes because I have small lashes I don't have long lashes and I like the way it looks with the long lashes but you can keep it like this if you'd like to so like I said before I was going to be adding lashes these letters are from kiss and I will put that down in the description below I'm taking this Ruby kisses lip liner and this is my go-to lip I pretty much wear this all the time I just love the way it looks on my skin and it looks more you know natural but I'm gonna line my lips with this and then take my can't think right now I'm going to take my NYX cream lip cream matte lip stain and the color Stockham and go over my lip liner with that and that is the final step to this look I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to leave me a like or a comment if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them and I will be back with more videos so see you soon love you bye youeveryone welcome back to my channel um I know it's been a long time since I've uploaded a video but if you haven't noticed I did dye my hair I went lighter I took out all the black right now it's still kind of like an orangish color but I'm letting my hair rest in the meantime you know that I go back to my second session and surprisingly my hair got really light for the first like time that I bleached it or whatever and it's super healthy usually you remember how I was telling you guys in my previous video whenever I bleached my hair it gets so up well I have been treating it with this amazing product it's by Paul Mitchell it's the awapuhi and when you go lighter with your hair and you use like chemicals in your hair it's really good to replenish your hair and treat it with treatments or like you know oils and all that good stuff um so yeah today's tutorial is going to be a tutorial on this look I have a separate video on how to do my eyebrows anyways I'm going to shut the up and get started with the tutorial but before I get started with the tutorial I want to show you guys the palette that I'm featuring today which is the anastacio shadow couture world traveler palette which I have been obsessed with and the colors that I'm using are like the brownish ones I use a little bit of the purple and also the pink champagne which is my favorite color and I used on the lid I'm a saucy did an amazing job at formulating these eyeshadows because they're all the anasazi eyeshadows are amazing and they work beautifully especially if you don't really know how to blend the colors blend out themselves literally and then also on my lips I'm wearing one of the new liquid lipsticks from the Fall collection if you guys are too scared to wear like a really really dramatic color like this I would say go minimal on the eyes and don't like do too much but since I was feeling glam luck today I was like are I'm going to go super Jurado can totally switch up the lip color you can use a red or burgundy a dark red or even a nude I was kind of like wanting to do a nude but like I said I was really excited to use these hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and if you want to know how to achieve this look then please keep on watching so as always I'm going to go ahead and prime my eyes with soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac this is just going to help all of our eyes shadows stick on all day and it's going to help the color show up exactly like what it looks like in the actual palette because I know for a long time I struggled with that I like to mainly focus most of the product on the lid and then slowly fade upward because on the lid is where we use the color that we want to be most pigmented in this case it's going to be the shimmery one in the UH Nastasia palette to start this look I'm going to go ahead and be taking the color Morocco from the Anasazi palette and I am taking a blending brush and we're going to go ahead and say that I speeded the video up so it doesn't take this short amount of time for those of you who think that it takes no time at all it's totally a lie but make sure you take your time with this step because this step is going to make or break your eyeshadow so make sure to blend out everything very very seamlessly and I went in with my Sigma e-40 which is another clean blending brush just to go ahead and clean up any rough edges you taking an angled shader brush I'm going to go ahead and pick up the color soft peach which is a matte creamy shade and we're just going to use this right underneath our eyebrows to highlight our eyes using a tinier fluffy brush I'm going to go in with the color fudge and I'm going to be applying this on the outer corners of my eyes I like to use this brush to specifically deposit and then I go in with another brush which is a dupe for the Mac 217 and this one is by morphe and I like to blend out the color that I applied with a smaller brush and you can go ahead and keep adding just depending on how dark you want your look to be you now this is my personal favorite step going to go ahead and take this flat shader brush which is by far one of my favorite shader brushes it totally beats the Mac 239 it works well with dry products and as well as cream which is super duper duper hard to find and then I went in with a color called pink champagne which is the best color in the pole palette and applied this on top of the primer and just keep packing it on until you reach your desired amount so now I'm going to go ahead and line my eyes I sped this up really quickly because if I were to not speed it up we would be here for literally like 15 minutes next I'm going to go ahead and go in with my brown retractable liner by la girl to line the bottom I didn't use black because I didn't want it to be too harsh and Brown always add some softness to the look since we're already going really really dark with the gel liner and I like to apply this on the lower lash line as well and this is how I achieve my smoked out look you can go ahead and add whatever color eyeshadow that you want on top of this but for this specific look I wanted to use the purple in the palette and I used it that same little tapered brush that we used earlier on in the tutorial to apply the brown on the outer corners of the crease so then with a smaller brush I went ahead and grabbed pink champagne and the color chick / chic to highlight the inner corners of our eyes and I'm going to go ahead and use my Alex faction lashes and by the way I do have a coupon code these are by far my favorite mink lashes at the moment to finish up the look you can totally use whatever lashes that you want to use now moving on to the skin I'm going to go ahead and prime my face with the NYX HD primer I like to use this one specifically when I want to be really really dramatic and I want my makeup to last on all day I believe it does have SPF which is why it kind of gives me like a white cast so don't worry about that because your foundation that you apply on top of that will go ahead and cover that and in this case I am using my matte foundation by NARS and I never really pick up this foundation but since I want to try something new I went ahead and used it so go ahead and apply your desired amount I would suggest to apply a lot because you can never wear too much makeup and I always always always always use my Beauty Blender to blend out my foundation just because I feel like brushes tend to make my face look streaky you now I'm taking my la girl pro conceal you really don't have to do this step but I really feel like this step adds to the effect of the highlight and contour I use the yellow just because I am a yellow undertone so if you are a yellow undertone this would be perfect to use and I just use this underneath the eyes because this is going to brighten I guess it's kind of like a reverse step of like instead of using the banana powder you kind of use it as a cream but since it's a little bit too yellow for me I always apply the classic ivory concealer right on top of that which is another one by la girl as well and with this one I'm going to be applying it all over to the highlighted areas which would be the forehead down the nose Cupid's bow chin underneath the eyes and then I like to add a little bit right underneath where my contour is going to be just to add a little bit more to the dramatic mists of this look you can totally skip this step and you don't have to use as much makeup as I'm using but like I said I love to wear makeup so for the contour shade I'm going to use the color toast and I use a little bit with this one be careful with this concealer because it is super pigmented and if you apply too much it's going to be a hot mess so don't don't get overwhelmed when you like blend out the like the contour color because you can always go back and blend in with like a foundation to help like dilute the darkness of the shade you take your time with this because this video is sped up and I can't emphasize that enough because a lot of people kind of like make these videos and people are like what the like why is it mine as perfect as hers in the video but you have to understand that when you record these videos it's kind of like different than when you're doing it like on yourself so just take your time because typically it takes me about an hour to do my makeup not 12 minutes so now I'm going to go ahead and set my foundation and I'm using my Beauty Blender for this step I like to pack it on this is a way to make your foundation last all day you guys hear that it's like a computer giving up cuz I've been editing this damn video for like eight hours so go ahead and leave this on your face for about I would say a minute maybe thirty Seconds to a minute and then you can go ahead and dust it off with a brush any brush will work and then whatever you have left over go ahead and kind of like apply it over where you apply your contour because remember we haven't set that to go ahead and just kind of like buff that in there going into my honest asik on Turkey I like to mix the last two colors just because I feel like none of the colors kind of fit me so I kind of just mix all of them with my fan brush I love love love this brush because it gets right into the hollows of my cheeks making it super easy for me to contour so I go ahead and use this for my contour and then for my highlight and for my blush as well so the highlight that I'm using is called opal what I hate about highlights is sometimes like when I breakout it kind of highlights like my little pimple so I'm just like I'm kind of screwed but whatever or my Bush apparently I didn't use my fan brush but you can go ahead and use the fan brush or whatever brush you want to use um I don't remember what purchase thing I think this is by Sigma but the blush and I'm using in Spring Sheen I have a very light hand when it comes to that because I personally don't like blush at all so the mascara that I'm using is one by hot makeup I also have a coupon code for that I will go ahead and make all my coupon codes down below and all the products that I use today because it is so many products you need to like list or like verbally say in the video and then I am using my honest hacia liquid lipstick in the colour sepia to finish off the complete look so that is pretty much it I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know what you guys want in the comments down below even though it's going to take me like probably like a month to like finally get to it but ain't better late than never so I'll see you guys in my next videohi everyone so I'm going to do a everyday tutorial makeup tutorial this is gonna be combat carve get really with me love what I basically do every day and this is like my go-to everyday so I wouldn't do this every single day but it's more like my everyday makeup when I want to be glam or like when I can't think I think I want to do on that day I'll let you just do this because easiest option it's so easy to do if you're wondering why I've got this bandage on my thumb in a tiny little horror story right now so basically I probably explain what happened but basically my thumbnail or my thumb obviously I've got fake nails on my thumbnail got taken off so the acrylic and it tip it took off the my real nail with it so basically I've basically just got raw skin underneath this is quite painful it's actually quite hard to do my makeup so if you know how I got this very simple look then you write on this on white eyebrows this is Mac eyebrow pencil in spite I'm gonna speed this it up just because I've got a full video of like how I do my eyebrows so if you want to know how I do my eyebrows in detail then I'll put a link in the description but I'm going to get money I move now for our brush by real techniques we've used to help I broke it I use about a bit and the elf has now been discontinued but I know that blows of places - like I broke it I know sneak comes with one for a good price but if not then just use a brown eyeshadow that complements your brows okay to conceal my brows I'm going to use my Mac Pro Longwear concealer with this I like to put it on one brow fast so I put it on and then I blend it as soon as I put it on this concealer tends to dry very very quickly and then it goes all orangie and stuff once it's just dried in place and it's just not you so I put it on blend it put on another area blend it you get I blend it with my Real Techniques crease brush deluxe crease brush so I just wear this cuz simple it just come down here I just drag it free middle every light this concealer the only thing I don't like is how much comes out of the pump like loads is on my hand and lows didn't need to be on my hand but there's no work really control okay then I do the cockpit so this probably a better browser never I mean is rare I get both of them or ordinate point then what I do is I get my Urban Decay primer potion well I also have to do is make sure concealer is here so whatever is remain on this brush that I use to blend out on my eyebrows and just put it here because I don't forget to put it there and then I take pictures and then there's like just anyway I'm going to use the find it at my Mac two to four brush today I'm going to use it is it with everything today we compute the post off noise okay today I'm going to use the Too Faced chocolate bar palette then dip it in the color milk chocolate and it's semi-sweet and this will go my quiz they're just going to use a flat eyeshadow brush and go with the color white chocolate which is this one and I'm going to pack this all over the lid vacuum with the two colors that we had before which is my chocolate and it's a sweet and go back in degrees okay that's that fire shadow right then I'm going to use my L'Oreal suite lineup I'm sure they've discontinued this so every time like I see like one like left to the shop and itchy just like fire bit this is my favorite ever I lied I don't know why they would ever just continue like you don't say hearts I am I've also I'm gonna speed this up as well but also those two little penis so that would be linked more so now there's a little bit mascara wrong okay I'll go flashing on these I normally use on a when I put makeup on I don't mean use ardell demi whispies that she's going to be using today I'm very easy as diaper twice so they're not as crushed as one it's me okay so I put my lashes on and I'm going with this drug before anything goes with my eyes then I'm going to start I'm going to put this Mac strobe cream on where I want to blue darling okay so I've been using em the new NARS foundation I love comfort I love it right this is the all day luminous weightless foundation I'm in circles or however you say it but this is what it looks like I really like this foundation it says you'll need one pump to like have a full face coverage but I am a full face junkie even though I don't need it but I love like really full face so I use like two and a half pumps but you could use you could easily get away with one or two using my Real Techniques buffing brush I'm just tapping in at first with this foundation I like it more as the day goes on so M because that does it goes quite it goes on quite matte and I'm not really a Maps fan I like the glue okay so that's foundation on I'm just going to use my Real Techniques spongy pinging and just hi is this a dump it's damp at moment so I'm just going to Pat it just to make sure everything's even and blend it out properly okay I'm then going to use my know I was radiant creamy concealer in caramel and this I don't put it directly like right here because that's too much product and then it will cause too much creasing so like when I'm blending it out I'll just work it up so it's not nodes I'll just put it anywhere else where I feel like I sometimes use my pro longwear as well as the NARS radiant creamy concealer but there just don't need ever telling you concede I always think like completely casinos it's really good okay I'm going to say with my Ben Nye banana powder and I'm going to use some where is it Asylum up max you fix fluid in nw15 this is for contour I know this seems like a lot of products for an everyday look but this is what I like to do and also is I don't actually use a lot or product not what anyways I want to move it so anyway I'm relieved my body shop foundation brush oh this is a blusher brush actually I know it's a foundation brush but and I'm gonna blend it I like my Punto to be quite strong contour strong I like it to be just like quite visible usually it'll be really bit more he's my blendy brush she makes sure everything's blended and undergo my body shop kabuki brush I might use my Mac mineralize skinfinish in deep dark literally use like a little bit this is just to warm up the face slightly you don't want to like to do deep contour with this you just want it to just warm up the face tattoo little bit okay ends to contour properly well to contour over the cream foundation contour contour ready I'm going to use my matte bronzer by Mac use my Real Techniques cheap brush I also have to contour my nose I like to use my Mac - - for I'm doing that I don't do it lowers just slightly we have to know that everyone has to do this okay so now I'm going to use my love's two drops and some rush we've got really watery recently I'm not Reginald boy but anyway I'm just going to put it on oh I put it on on my cheekbones I put on my forehead and a bit on my nose I'm just going to use my same a buffing brush and blend it in this is the same brush I use for my foundation okay then I get my in a mask on highlight I can't see the color it's rub dog up it is what it looks like little bit on a fan brush and we just I just put my Cheetos mainly okay then I'm going to go in with blusher I like to do my highlight before my blood like for like 800 feet just blends in a little bit a little bit more once my highlight is done and then I just blush one you just put those in there I'm going to my L ticking brush with Mac's /i it teaches okay I'm also going to use today my mac eyeliner this is in I'll go alone it's just a nude that put it in my waterline I like to use nude colors rather than white because it's just that little bit more natural and it's not just like BAM I've got white eyeliner on drumming but it still opens your eye I'm going to use a little bit of a star on the bottom eyelashes I never I don't really really up I have been recently this is just a natural collection skaara I don't ever spend money on scars because my Allah she's not long anyway so I feel like nothing makes a difference and then I use whatever color our lipstick I said of the day that could be red because you get hot purple which would just be like any powerful but normally I go for a nude on an everyday basis and today I'm going to use peach stock by Mac as quite is it that is a very nude color looks like that then I use my Mac lip gloss in wildly lush and I use my mac fix+ spray I really go in with the spray by the way like I really like I'll go in and that is what I do every day basically well not every day this is what I do this is

fashion show they actually did a lot more wavy instead of curls this year so they're super tight now I'm just gonna brush them out and them look more wavy not tight curls so you should definitely check out this gift set I'll have a link down below because it's perfect to give for the holidays and there's also a lot of different deals and sets with new me so you can check those ones out too so this is the hair I'm just twisting it when you twist it and then see how I'm doing that it makes it look like bigger thicker waves and that's what we want so here is the hair and I thought the makeup was so awesome and I've been doing my foundation routine a little bit different so and then I'd show you how I do it all in one so I'm starting off with the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation and my Beauty Blender I'm obsessed with the Beauty Blender I don't know what I did without it it just blends so perfectly and gives such a natural look of your foundation while keeping the coverage that you want so it's perfect I'm just dabbing this all over my face and the foundation is really really amazing too I've been loving it um and I'm also going to press it over my eyelids because I don't like to use an extra eye primer I just use Foundation and concealer so I switch between the tart and Anastasia concealer because they're both really the same kind of coverage I think but I just got the Anastacio one and I'm loving it as you can tell like see how great that coverage is it's super brightening it's really easy to apply and it just immediately makes your face look so much more awake and bright so I really like that and I use my new blender too it is perfect it is a Holy Grail product um so the color I'm in in this concealer is the lightest one I think it's point five you know the struggle the struggle so I'm just putting this on my nose on my forehead and my chin underneath my eyes all places that I want to highlight my face because as you can tell it just really brightens it up and makes your face book makes it pop so I really really recommend this concealer I think it's amazing but also the Tarte one is really great too it gives a similar coverage but this one just I just did this one in the Top Pot way then i am using the laura mercier secret brightening powder and again on my Beauty Blender just tapping this underneath my eyes to set the concealer using a translucent and brightening powder will just keep it bright and you won't lose like the coverage you have underneath your eye so I'm just putting that everywhere that I put the concealer and over my eyelids too so I have a good base for my eyeshadows I'm gonna take a face powder on the rest of my face this one's a little bit darker this one's for Marc Jacobs I know I'm using like more higher-end stuff I'm sorry about that that's just like things I ended up using um right now for my foundation routine you can use any one that you want like you definitely don't need to be high-end I'm using a bronzer now and I'm just giving a soft kind of contour ah sometimes I do a really harsh ones but I thought the girls for the show had more of a softer contour it was still dramatic and names still contoured but not like a straight line um and it just like immediately gives that slimmed-down face as you can tell on the other side so I'm just blending blending blending I'm using the Anastasia contour palette and also blend it down your neck so it all matches now I'm contouring my nose and I'm not great at this um it's a work in progress I'm working on it so I don't think I did a very good job but I have to practice to get there I'm just using the same bronzer I used and putting this on my nose I'm trying to figure out what kind of contour works best with the shape of my nose um but yeah just trying to contour that and then I'm gonna blend it out once I have it in the place that I like just with like the big fluffy brush I'm just gonna blend it all out so it's not just straight dark lines on my nose because that would not look right now for the highlight this is a Nastasia two and I'm just applying this to my cheek bone I'm using this tiny roll brush which I think a bigger brush it's a little bit better but this is what I had with me and it still worked so I'm applying this underneath my brow and on my nose I really like a super highlight and knows to I don't know I just think it's cute um putting it on my Cupid's bow on the other side also above my eyebrow I just like to highlight like crazy I love the glowing look and I thought the girls had that too I'm also putting it on my inner corner because I noticed that their makeup was super bright in the inner corner to just like shimmery and natural I'm also putting it on my lower lashline to brighten even more we just really want a bright and glowy look and face it so now I'm just blending everything out because there's a lot of different products on I want it to flow really naturally so I'm just blending blending blending then taking NARS orgasm blush I think this blush matches what they are wearing pretty close they had a lot of blush on so I'm really trying to pack this on to get the same effect and there is the foundation I've loved this routine I've been doing and it's so amazing I'm taking the Urban Decay all nighter spray and setting my face with that just gives the best dewy effect after it makes it look a little bit more natural and not cakey so that's great then I'm taking some eyeshadows to use for my brows I'm using eye shadows because I want it to be a little bit more natural I know that their eyebrows weren't like super defined and perfect so I was trying to do the same thing trying to keep them super natural filling them in on the end and then working in on the inner inner part of my eyebrow and then adding like little hairs as you can see how I'm doing right there with the brush so I couldn't make them very even but I was just trying to keep them as natural as possible not like super defined so you can watch what I'm doing um and as I'm watching it looks like your girl needs to get your eyebrows done I didn't even notice that but this HD camera is really showing me that it's time um so I was filling those in and you got to work with it you know I just wanted to give them natural so that's what I did with that and voila now I'm taking the taupe color from my lorac Pro palette and applying this in my crease I'm not focusing on the outer corner at all I noticed that that's how their crease colors looked so I decided to do the same thing and I'm also applying it on my lower lashline to balance it out and give a little smokiness underneath but still keeping it super natural because this is a pretty light color then I'm taking the lenses from Maybelline of just a pencil eyeliner and I'm going to line my upper lash line because it was more soft it wasn't like a felt tip or the liquid eyeliner that they use and I'm also not going to wing it at all which is what I normally do I'm just putting on a lash line and actually I do try to wing it a tiny bit just a mini mini mini wing like that just to kind of pull out the eyes a little bit more and I'm going to do the same thing on the other eye yes it's only Holi you can't forget curling your eyelashes so I'm just gonna do that I like to kind of pump it a little bit so it gives the best curl then I'm using the Tarte lights camera lashes and mascara and this one's amazing it gives you the kind of false eyelash look without having to apply them so I've been using this one a lot lately and I'm also applying it to my lower lashes just a little bit I'm not going super crazy and then that is the eye look for my lips I'm using pure Hollywood from Anastacio it's a liquid lipstick they had a kind of like peachy pink color so this is what I decided to go with and just because this is new I really wanted to use it that's why I used it and that's the look I'm totally obsessed with it I think it's super natural and pretty um and it just like highlights the best features you know if you trust out make sure to send me a picture and thanks for watching bye guys mmmokay so to start off with I'm going to be moisturizing my face and then the one that I have been loving it's kind of expensive for this little jar but this is the Clinique Moisture Surge intense and then this stuff is so bomb I've been using this for like I don't know like I got a little tester from Sephora and I fell in love and I was like dude this is so bomb so even if you're oily I always suggest to moisturize your face because it just it makes your foundation look that much more nice and unlike not so much a dewy but just so much more fresh and healthy looking all right so now that you're all moisturized you kind of want to let that sit in what I do and then I go ahead and put on my primer the one that I keep using it's really inexpensive and it's so so balm is the Rimmel stay matte primer and it looks like this and this one is um I think it's like less than ten dollars and you can get this at Ulta so also if you buy like over ten dollars out Ulta you can use like a 350 coupon and then you save three dollars and fifty cents so then now I'm just putting on the primer and this is really really good I feel like I do stay pretty mad but it's not like super matte or like I start to like look dry and flaky I don't know if you guys can hear it this song has been my shit it's on it's called Kanye by the chainsmokers so bomb and for my pores because I feel like my pores are like super visible I like to use the Porefessional primer from benefit and I got this one this is like a little travel size I think and it's actually really really really good and it lasts for like a really long time this one I usually just put on my t-zone on my nose and rub it in and I also really like this one because it doesn't feel as drying because I have the Smashbox one the purple one this one is for your pores as well to just minimize them and I feel like that one's a little drying so I really like this one because this one I feel like it gives me a bit of moisture as well you guys already know my favorite foundation this one a lot of people ask me what color I'm in I put that shit in the description box guys like no pens but check that shit and I am in the shade 106 Sun beige and I think this is like my second tube I've gone through so I like to put this one on as well as um the Maybelline fit me foundation and then this one looks like that this is the dewy one I think yeah because the other one's a matte and poreless this one is in the shade 230 just in case anyone's wondering because I feel like this one is really really mad and I don't want to look so mad anymore I kind of got over that I kind of want to have like a luminous look to my skin there was this person who made me laugh so bad they commented on that one makeup video I think says something about my ears how like I like the video was cool or whatever but like when they looked at my ears like they cringed and I was I don't know it's just funny I think that word is hella funny I already damped dampen my um Beauty blender or makeup sponge whatever the fuck is called oh my god I need to stop cussing - I really don't like it anymore like I've been obsessed with saying like bad words lately I think it's like really fun it like really brings out my emotion and I can be like fuck or like dig but yeah this is the real techniques like everyone knows what this one looks like and I actually really like this one it does when you let it dry um it does kind of like start crumbling off little pieces I don't know why it does that and um oh I like this song and then um I noticed that when I want to like wash it - use it again the next day it's just that's the only con that I have about it but it's really really bomb and I people what am i work like I suggest it and like I'm just like sorry like I really like to tell people like very like really really bomb makeup products that are inexpensive and I feel a little bad because like the sales and stuff at work but like dude is like I want you guys to save money I want you guys to have bomb shit still look fleek but save your money like who doesn't want that now you look like ass fuck with your flawless s skin I'm going to be using the Mac Pro Longwear concealer I usually use the Maybelline one which is so BAE like this one is I don't know I love finding inexpensive products that are really bomb and I'm gonna take that same makeup sponge I want to cut it call it a Beauty Blender but I feel like some people like really take that up the ass and they're like the little beauty blender because I know that they're like 30 bucks or some bullshit like that this one works just fine big I'm gonna just blend it out look hella crazy and then um I think I also showed that I like semi baked in that one makeup video so I'm gonna go ahead and do that a gun I always do it because I realized that when I bake under my eyes it just it helps my under-eye area not to crease at all and then I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows off camera because I already have a tutorial or a video on that if you guys want another one I guess I can do another one since I do have a newer camera and then you guys will like see it more updated more um just better quality you know what I realized that I forgot to do I forgot to bronze my face and I forgot a highlight I was wondering I was like why am i done so early it's like barely he's barely 12:08 to like really I'm almost done with my makeup usually it takes me like two hours no lie so I was like damn like I'm almost done I'm gonna have time to chill before work but no I forgot to put bronzer on and I forgot to put on my highlight what I usually use for bronzer now another very inexpensive the bomb thing um hair it gotta put my hair out of my face double duty it's a wet and dry pressed powder foundation and then this is the old two one it's so bomb um as you can tell like I've hit pan so I mean I'm not lying and then I don't really contour anymore I just feel it's kind of harsh like sometimes I really do but I mainly now I just like Browns my face the reason why I only just bronze is because I sold I don't know like I feel like it just it looks fine like once I stopped contouring like so intensely like I would have liked that straight line down my cheek like I've kind of felt weird but then like I asked my sister I was like dude do I even like that difference she was like no not really like it's just whatever and I was like I don't have to go extra so I was like why not why not just try bronzing and I just I don't know in my opinion I feel like it looks a lot better on my face and then that is kind of funny to say like Oh less fake more natural it's like bitch if you want to be natural just don't wear any makeup but honestly I kind of like I'm kind of like all or nothing you know it's kind of like if you're gonna do your makeup might as well just like beat your face you know like if you want to do like natural just put on mascara and that's it and then maybe like add some gimme brow or something so you can literally look natural but it's kind of funny to me when I see like natural makeup and you see that they put on like pounds of makeup on like I'm not hating but it's kind of like who cares dude like it's makeup like if you want to put on hella fucking makeup why the fuck not I really hate that people say oh she puts on how the makeup design I it's like who cares you know like I don't know if that's kind of I don't know how to explain myself so good but I hope that kind of makes sense like don't call it natural it's fine just say neutral it's like neutral colors you know like I really hope I explained that well and note that the way I kind of say what I want to say is it so clear sometimes like honestly I hate the fact that I like girls feel the need to justify what they do it's just like what the fuck cares you know I don't know like um there is this one guy who commented on my I put a comment on his video cuz he made a stupid oz video about oh how girls are at the gym and I was just like dude this is such a stupid video and the guy isn't even funny and this guy commented back because it was his video obviously you know and he was like I bet you're the type of girl to go to the gym with a full face you know like with hella makeup on and then like I was going to respond and then I was just like like why like why I don't need one I don't know him - do you really think that wearing a fuck ton of makeup to the gym is gonna make me work out like less how do I say it's gonna it's not going to make me work out less than I'm capable of working out like when I go to the gym with a full face of makeup on I fucking go hard when I go with there's some stuff on I still go as hard and then when I go with just maybe lashes and brows no liner no nothing I it's all the same it's like why do you feel the need to tell someone oh I bet you're that type of girl it's like do you like I'm probably going harder than you at the gym the fuck I don't mean to sound like a bitch or whatever but less shit like pisses me off so much you know it's just like you really think putting makeup on my face isn't gonna like I'm still gonna train hard you know whatever okay so for highlight I'm gonna be using this one from Mac this one's my favorite like when I got it I was like dude should I get it should I know I took me like a good ten minutes to decide to actually buy it and then this one is global glow and I'm just gonna put a lot of it not gonna lie on my cheekbones I literally have like the mirror like right in front of me I've never done my makeup like this so um let me know if this is okay like I know that my background is not so cute um but yeah if you guys don't mind these type of videos just I mean tell me I guess in the comments like oh these are cool like it's fun watching I guess I'm gonna go in with the tinted brow mascara um by NYX another inexpensive product see I'm not lying like these products are so bond and then I just go over that um I go over it lightly what the fuck am I saying see I you guys I can't talk I'm not going to cut that out because this is real life stuff like I noticed that I stopped breathing to to do my brows like I literally hold my breath and then like I don't know where like I'm just like and then like I just started laughing I was like damn even for my brows dude do it for the brows cool so now we're done with their face I got a little bit closer just so you guys can see what I'm doing I have this like little mini Urban Decay primer potion that I got as a sample oh my god I didn't even finish telling you guys about the gem thing like it just really pisses me off if you're a guy and you're watching this um and you like judge girls for that shit just like rethink what you say you know it's like really stupid when guys or even girls like they judge people for worrying makeup it's like you don't know if they just got off of work do like what if they feel like hella insecure without their makeup and you're over there making them feel bad you know it's like everyone has their own shit you know you guys really have to like watch what you guys say not to me cuz I feel like I don't get a lot of like hate comments like a lot of people are nice and I'm really really grateful for that but you guys just like may not like you exactly like I'm not directing it to you but I'm just saying like like everyone even myself like I have to think about shit that I say we have to all think about it because you don't know if they've like they've had the last straw in that day and like it what if that one thing that you tell them that just like throws them over the cliff or whatever the same is and they're dead no like you don't know you don't know people's situation I get so like I'm very very passionate about that like just being nice showing people that you care like having a big heart like don't be a bitch I don't know if your guy the judges or a girl also seem to you like just really think about the people you know like would you want someone to say that to your mom would you want someone to say that to your sister would you want someone to say hi to you for my um under the eyebrow I'm gonna be or I'm using this one right here it's so hard to do this I'm not used to doing that it's like a really big pallet and then I'm just using that for under the brow just to kind of set the concealer that I used to like kharbut do these shadows are so buttery like the first time I use them like I'm not used to them being this soft that they kind of like not crumble but they kind of um they're kind of messy and like the first time I use them I was like whoa like they're messy but they're so long so now I'm gonna go in with kind of like a brown it's a warm brown color it's right under the first yellowy one that I used this one right here the reason that you start off with lighter colors is just because it makes it so much easier to blend your eyeshadow and then that's how it looks so bond like if you're doing like a dark like burgundy eye or like a dark brown eye or a dark like black eye or like a dark smoky purple eye so you just start off slowly I know like some people are new and like they um they wonder how like people do it like that but that's how I was - at first like I would just put on like the harsh like just dark color one color cuz I didn't I honestly didn't know like I had to teach myself I had a pretty much just do the whole trial and error and that's like basically how I learned and then now people tell me that they like my makeup but I'm just like I guess thank you I mean I don't want to be like cocking like oh yeah because I honestly don't know if my makeups nice like people might say it's nice but is it really okay now I'm going to be taking the bag 217 brush and then with this one I'm gonna really like put it in my crease I'm gonna take more of a like this color and then maybe that color just to like build up ntencity because I did say I when I do like that like dark smoky Brown I I've also been wanting to dye my hair I've been trying to strip it at home I don't know if you guys can tell like it's kind of like a light gray in person some of it is like a green and it just looks really in my opinion it looks a little bit crazy but um I mean that's what I got for doing it myself right I don't think it looks that bad though but what do you guys think I really want to diet like I don't want to go to like a teal color or I want to I want to go back to purple or I want to do like a lavender but I just I'm so indecisive and sometimes I'm just like dude I should just go back to blah and then I'm just like nah because people tell me they like it and I don't know I feel like the Purple's really me but it's kind of a hassle to maintain it and then since I did dye it myself I feel like it doesn't look as good you know you get my feel so if you guys want to let me know what color I should do next like I'm open to any color like I wanted to do rose gold but um like I'm not sure if my hair is like gonna take it like I got some fucked up bastard so now that we have all of that on I'm gonna take my finger just so it's more in time I'm gonna just put it like um like on the lid because it kind of looks a bit lighter right there I'm going to go ahead and do my under arse and then same thing put it under here and just kind of connect on those two together I'm just packing on on the color and then with every shadow that I add it's good and it's just getting darker cuz I do want this to be very smoky I'm really into glitter so I'm going to go ahead and add some glitter on my inner corners because I don't really like how it looks when it's like that white thing like the white inner corners I think that it looks so funny on me this was like three dollars I think it's super inexpensive it's so bomb it's lasted me like damn I've had this since um I don't know if you guys knew but I used to work out Walmart and I've had it since I worked at Walmart because I bought it there and then what I do is I put my pinky in there and then I just put in my inner corners and I think it looks super bomb I'm gonna go ahead and do my eyeliner and then I'll come back and put on my lashes you guys already know my favorite lashes I'm actually stocked up here let me show you guys just to be a bitch so I have all of these just because I'm not obsessed like I'm I'm not gonna be without them I'm not gonna like run out I was like fuck no I'm gonna have these I'm gonna be stocked up for life every time I see them no matter what like I have one two three four five I have six backups but these are my favorite lashes so anytime I see them like I just grab them like fuck being without these they're so long okay now I have everything on I put all my lashes on my hair is in front now I put on mascara as well because I mean I didn't want you guys to like see me doing like you know like my face like that um so this is the final look it's very like warm very smoky in my opinion um usually I don't do this anymore but I don't know I think I came out nice I've also been thinking to do a Q and a because just so like the new people can get to know me I still want to do my lips I don't know what I'm planning to do I mean I'll probably just go for a neutral lip like always cuz why the fuck not I'm going to take max nice and spicy lipliner you this is the NYX soft matte lip cream in the color London and it's number four and I'm just gonna I hope it looks nice I'm gonna put that all over my lips all right so basically this is the finished love and I want to say thank you guys so much for watching let me know what color I should do my hair let me know if I should do the Q&amp;A and then just let me know what you guys think about like everything that I was saying and if there's any questions I'm going to leave all the products down in the little description box so please check that

products that I've been using for my skincare not that it has changed but you guys keep requesting it so I'm going to show it to you guys so I start off by washing my face with my daily face wash I would list it down description box below there's no specific name for it after I towel dry my face I like to go in with this daily serum that I've been using for over a month I saw it in my friends Channel and I really wanted to try it out and it's made up of things that are specifically needed for my face so that's what I like about it it also has microbeads in it so it makes it really nice and easy for you to exfoliate your face while you're putting it on your face so afterwards I just washed it off and then apply my favorite moisturizer which I've been using for a really long time now and if I see a pimple coming out the first thing that I do is apply this lotion that my dermatologist actually gave me ELISA Danton scription box below I like to put it either 20 minutes before stores with my makeup or before I go to bed Mikey boy wanted to say hi today so I brought him on camera for you guys so that is pretty much today let's go ahead and get started with the fun part our makeup go ahead and do my eyebrows I'm using a bra with by Anastasia Beverly Hills in the shape dark brown and I'm also going to apply her brow gel which is amazing for taming your hair to prime my eyelids

it with a neutral shade from the Tarte pad that I've been talking about for over a month here on my channel and on snapchat and I'm just going to apply this all over the lid afterwards I'm going to take this camel shade and ie 38 brush by Sigma and I'm just going to apply this on my crease taking this dark brown shade and the same brush that we use on our crease I'm going to apply this on my outer crease just to intensify the look a little bit more and I do want the look to be warm so that's why I'm taking a dark brown shade to smoke out the look I'm going to take an e25 brush by Sigma and a black shade from the Tarte palette and I'm just going to apply this only on the outer parts of my V to warm up the look a little bit more I'm going to take this beautiful warm shade and a sigma e40 brush and I'm just going to apply this in my crease and just make sure that everything is blended in really nice to highlight my brow bone I'm going to apply this beautiful neutral shade on my lid today I want to use a really nice neutral shade so I'm going to go on up with this vanilla colored eyeshadow from the Tarte palette and I'm going to apply this all over my lid four eyelashes today I'm gonna go in with my Koko lashes and goddess this is the first time I think I'm applying my eyelashes such dramatic eyelashes with my hands and I did an amazing job you guys I am so proud of myself because apply your eyelashes with your fingers sometimes can be a little bit difficult that's why I use a tweezer a tweezer is best for beginners now going into my face I'm going to go in with a my makeup forever a mattifying primer and I'm just going to Pat this on the center of my face for foundation today I'm gonna go in with my Becca cosmetics ever matte foundation and I'm going to apply this with a Beauty Blender to highlight my face today I went in with my mac prolongwear concealer which I've just got yesterday and it's my favorite this is like the fifth one I purchased and I have it in the shade NC 25 and I'm just blending that in with my Beauty Blender to contour my face today I'm going to be using my NARS Itoh brush and I'm using my Kat Von D shade + light contour kit I didn't realize that I grabbed the wrong foundation because I have this foundation in three different shades and my shade right now is nude and I actually grabbed no ice set which is much lighter so that's why I had to really go in and bronze up my skin a ton so before you guys are saying that the foundation is a little bit too light for me I know it was my mistake I grabbed the wrong foundation so please be nice and I went in with my Too Faced bronzer which is the darkest one and I absolutely love it especially to warm up your face this is a great bronzer going in with my favorite blush I'm going to just apply this on the apples of my cheeks for highlight today I wanted to use my so hollywood by anastasia beverly hills illuminator i've really been loving this highlight it is absolutely stunning it's a straight up gold highlight and it shows up beautifully on tanned and medium skin tones and then for my lips i went in it with a new lip liner that i just got em mac yesterday actually went to the store and picked up a few things that i was missing and this was one of it this is a new lip liner from their new line I believe the vamper fight line and I love it it's a deep ruby color and it's perfect for the fall time it's absolutely gorgeous you can wear by itself or you can top it off with a liquid lipstick to make sure that it stays in place for the rest of the day I went in with a colour-pop liquid lipstick in the colour LAX and I just applied it in the center because I didn't like the fact that you can see the inside of my lid and then I'm going to apply some eyeliner in my waterline as well to my tight line and then I'm going to apply some mascara to my lower lashes and that is pretty much it this is a final look I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so

amazing it's a company it's honestly a company that I want to give my money to the owners are a true rags to riches story they are a brother and sister who have come from nothing and made everything

honest people I'm like I'm right or die for them and one of those brands they're honest good hard-working people okay so now that you got that backstory on more feet let's jump into the video I know I can talk very quickly so because of that I am going to put every brush I talked about I'm going to put the number down here on the screen so you guys can see it somewhere because I know if I'm like this is the he thought before or you're gonna get wait what did you guys so I'm gonna put everything on the screen I've been talking about it so that you can see with your own eyes the name of the brush so there's no confusion hopefully that will help say no I can talk very quickly in start to ramble so let's get started it is very hard to narrow down my favorites but I did it and I feel like right here these are like my substantial brushes and I'm like yes I use these all the time I love them I'm right or die I'm gonna bring any brushes into this collection I was kind of like I kind of like it these are all brushes I'm like I love them so that is where we're at right now if you get the opportunity to go to the actual morphe store in Burbank California do not turn opportunity down it is literally brush heaven they have probably a hundred and fifty different brushes and they're just lined up all over the walls it is so overwhelming but in the most beautiful wedding possible so the first brush I'm going to talk about is the foundation brush and this is one of my favorite foundation brushes ever and you guys know that because for about what four or five months this is the only foundation brush that I use and I force myself to use other ones now because it's just so repetitive but this is the m43 nine I'm gonna have to look at the numbers because I'm not going to I don't have these memorized um this is the m43 9 brush what makes this brush so amazing to me is the fact that I can use less product and get more coverage if that makes sense as opposed to using like a damp Beauty Blender this takes like half of your product this does not steal your product because of its short synthetic density it takes a little bit of foundation and it really spreads it out on the face so one like this which is the tarte kabuki brush this one steals a lot of product because it has longer bristles so what applies a more sheer coverage which is really nice and i love it but i do use more foundation when i'm using this brush and i use less foundation just like a little bit when i'm using this one and it spreads it further around the face and doesn't steal as much product that's why i love this so much and i just feel like it's the perfect size not too tiny or too fat and just me everything so even and beautiful this is one of my all-time favorites right here I want to talk about four different brushes from the Ely collection and as you can tell by the name elite it's a more high-end luxurious collection by morphe but still extremely reasonably priced they say their price point is much higher because these brushes are more elite and more like luxurious but still they're like a quarter of the price of a mac brush so they're still very wallet friendly on the first I'm going to talk about is just my this is my baby and this is the e4 right here that's the way the Ely collection goes at E 1 2 3 4 because elite so e 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so on this is the blush brush it's technically a contour brush I personally like contouring with angled brushes like this this is what I use for blush and what I love and appreciate so much about this is everyone always wants to make their blush brushes and a natural goat hair and I do not like applying blush with a natural goat hair I think that it can make it go on kind of patchy to go back and get so much blush because it doesn't apply it properly this is like the most perfect blush brush in the world like I wish I made it myself it's so good like I just feel like it was meant for me like it is all my dreams come true in a blush brush I never think I'm gonna use another blush brush again I have no desire to try one someone could tell me you have to try this blush brush it's the best in the world I did mmm sorry you tell nothing but lies this is the best next one we have here is the e 34 and as you can see this one is just like a nice basic brush it's nice and round it's pretty short but it's not too short so it's not too dense what I like to use this for is blending out my bronzer I will show you the brushes that I initially fie bronzer with you can totally apply bronzer with this just right on the face perfect but I do things just a little bit different way in my routine and this is the blush brush that I will use once things are put on the face and maybe it's looking a little choppy maybe just a little unblended I will go over everything with this brush and just kind of blend everything out it's a really great just face blending brush if you need to blend out your contour your blush whatever it may be it's just one of those perfect sized round dome shape synthetic brushes that just blends everything out nice and smooth now we have the ìiî and this one is kind of a fat guy press out like this it gets nice and chubby but if you go like this it gets a little bit more thin and it goes up to this taper which I love and this is what I use where is my powder wait where's my powder seriously this one I use with the Laura Mercier translucent powder I use this to set my whole face is just nice and smooth and it applies powder very lightweight because we have this tapered miss right here you have bristles that are all different lengths and that will make things be applied very surely as opposed to a brush like this little pack things on it's all about the brush lengths that really like determine how your powder will be applied so that's why I use this brush for a nice loose powder because it will apply it really smoothly and softly and won't make it like patch up and then when you take flash photography all of a sudden you've got like white spots on your face this keeps everything nice and smooth so just great all over the face powder brush this bad boy oh my gosh I love is brush so much this one is actually a new one that I just grabbed from like my pile of like new brushes I actually have three of these though because I love this so much I'll tell you why this is the e one actually my face this is that you wanted as you can see it's really fat and it's really dense like it's really really chubby I'm gonna teddy - it feels very heavy weight and luxurious um believe it or not my favorite thing to use this brush for is actually applying tanner to my body um if you've seen my tanning routine I will leave it down below for you guys know has at the end of this video but I will um you see that like I edition I initially start off with this and I use this brush now I use this one actually the past three times I've applied tanner my body I've use this on my entire body and I haven't used a mint I literally just use this because it's so big in fat and it gets the job done so quick and so smooth because it's synthetic the honest-to-god this is my favorite way to apply some mascara now the other way that I will use this is if I do my foundation and I haven't tan in a while my foundation is too dark and I have like a line right here I will take some Ron's err on this brush and I will supply some of it and kind of bring it down to another thing I use this for so basically I use this as a body brush but if you are a powder girl if you like powder foundation and you want a full coverage this would be your go-to right here if you want sheer coverage I would do this if you want a full coverage this right here will get the job done an applier powder-like done so now for contour brush it I have to contour slash bronzer we're going to go through both of them and this one is the m5 two three oh my god I love those lines Oh much it is the most amazing contour brush I think I use it on camera for the first time maybe maybe I'm telling lies I'm not really quite sure so don't quote me on that I love this this is my go-to contour brush now because it's not too skinny um the NARS eita brush I'm not comparing anything but the NARS II to brush you guys know I've been ride or die for this for several years and I still absolutely love it but the one thing that I've heard other people complain about is that once they put the line on their face kind of difficult to blend that line out and I get it you have to really like be kind of careful with the way you apply it and you do that that this brush you don't have to worry about that because of the density again it's tapered we have shorter bristles down here and then it goes up to longer bristles that makes it so that when you put this on it doesn't create this harsh lines you can't blend out it makes it really easy to blend out your contour and it's not like a drag queen contour where it's like extremely cut off it makes it nice and soft in a more natural like can K contour I can't believe I this reference Kim K next one is basically a bigger fatter daddy version of this one like they pretty much have the same shape almost but this one is just like King Kong and this one 20 so this is the five to seven brush I love this for bronzing I would not consider this a contour brush though but it's an amazing bronzing brush I love it it gets on so quick and so beautifully I have been loving the where where am I I'm Norris here we go I have been loving it this luminous bronze light um bronzer from hourglass recently and I use this brush to apply I just go in like this tap it off and I just apply it all over the face like that I love it it just makes it so smooth because like I said I love applying bronzer with natural hairs for some reason blush and other areas of face I like a synthetic brush but bronzer I really really like the more natural hairs to apply it because it just makes it so natural looking and so smooth and bronze are something that I do not want to apply too generously otherwise it can go real quick and that's what the go hair will prevent it'll apply less products and make it less more smooth and more blendable so that's why I love this brush ok this brush I cannot live without I will make a bronzer slash contour blush highlight baking video I see the request to that so I will do that soon I'm just trying to get through like all the holiday videos but this brush you'll see me use it in that video this is the end four five nine brush you see me use this whenever I bake in my videos and I just like go like this you can see this powder on it right now and I stamp out the area that I really want to chisel that's what I love for this so much I've never actually used this for contour you can see off my Laura Mercier powder in there but I've never actually just a contour because it's too harsh I would not like the way this contours I can just tell but it is like perfection for carving out your contour so if you're sloppy is good to go yesterday my friend mica was here and her bronzer was kind of all over the place at the end of the day and not looking sharp not looking clean so I literally just grabbed this brush it went boo boo boo boo Boop and then just wiped it off and it looked nice and tight and clean again that's what I love about this brush such a great method and it's such a great brush to do that method with you guys see me use this brush in every video oh my goodness gracious this is the for 3/8 and I use this one to set my under eye area no matter what I'm setting it with no matter what powder this is the brush I use and I also use it to clean up down here any of the powder that I'm applying until I set the chin area I use set a forehead with highlight like whatever I am doing is like a lighter powder this is what I use to do that it's a great brush it applies things nice and gently again because you have the tapered area the shorter brushes that go to the longer ones and it's just such a great brush Sigma has one that's like the exact same pretty much right here this is their like gold collection it's like the exact same brush but the morphe ones just cheaper ah this is my baby this is the Evan 501 brush that's the only brush that I actually have to look in the numbers I just know I've talked to my head um this is the brush that I use for highlighting it's not technically a highlight brush I don't remember what they technically marketed as but soon as I got it I was this is perfection for highlighting and it's what I have used ever since I use a lot of other brushes for highlight and like I test them out like if people send me a brush in the mail or send me things to try on my first year I tried I'm like this is just it I always go and end up grabbing this one and applying my highlight with this brush because I just feel like it applies it nice and gentle gentle nice and gently and smooth and I just get the outcome that I desire I don't get too much and I go don't get too little so the m500 one my favorite highlight brush I get asked this all the time this is it right here buy more feet now we're going to move on to rushes and the first one I want to talk about is actually the first brush that I would go in with when doing any I look like the one I did today this is what I use or smokey eye this is the first brush that I'll recommend going in with and this is the morphe and obviously you buy morphe Jaqueline get it together this is the m4 for one rush so you would take up your lightest transition shade and then just go ahead and apply it right here in that transition area and if you're wondering what the transition area is it's the space between your eyelid and your brow bone right there you would put a really light color and that's going to be the transition to when you're doing any I look that's going to kind of fade out the transition from like heavy eye to nothing so that's the brush that I would use for that area is a natural hair so it applies it really nice and soft and smooth it doesn't like put on like a dense amount because you don't want that when you're working high up in this area this brush was created for this high up area and keeping it nice and smooth so I'm four for one this one is a ride-or-die can't live without this brush this is my absolute favorite I rush all-time and this is the M 4-3-3 brush I talk about this in a favorites video a few months back I have a couple of these because I just I'm constantly using this brush for everything this is the most like multi functional brush that I own because you can pack stuff on all of the live with this you can blend it out you can go hide in the low and go under the eye you can do anything with this so the M 4-3-3 has is my favorite eye shadow brush by morphe but what I use this one for typically and as you see in all my tutorials I use this brush every single time is packing on a color and the outer crease because of the shape again you have shorter bristles out here and then barely longer ones in the center ever so slightly so it's not too intense but it just makes it so that applies it so smoothly and it's so easy to blend out it's just such a good brush it's such a freakin good brush and then if you don't have products on it yes I'm using my leggings no judgement if you get the product off of your brush it makes a great brush to also apply up higher and the transition area as well it's just shorter and a little bit more denser than the original one that I talked about so you can see the difference sorry we're out of focus you can see the difference right there this one would supply a little less product and this one applies a little more which is why I initially like to go in with this one the m4 for one and then go in with the m4 3 3 next we have the e 22 this is a part of the elite collection since it has the e in front of it and is synthetic this one is really different and I love that about it so this one goes up to a nice taper as you can see very short bristles on the side to get longer and longer longer to a nice pointed taper which is great for when you're doing something right in this crease so if you want to add depth and you want to keep it low and you want to make sure that it doesn't go up too high into that transition area one like this might not be your best friend if you're working in that area and you want to keep it precise because it is so fluffy which is what I love about it because it blends everything out so nicely but this one on the other hand it doesn't blend it out as much but it keeps it nice and low and tight so now I have four smaller brushes more like precision brushes which I absolutely cannot live without precision brushes I feel like are something that can be really overlooked in the brush community but for me personally they're just as important as the blending brushes to get nice and precise on an eye look and the first one is the M 3 2 1 I love this for packing on it dark colors so sometimes like if you want to get something really nice and tight like low in this area the outer corner sometimes when you're using brushes like this they're a little too big and you feel like you can't get it right you can't get it like as dark as you want it to be because they're they're big and they're more for like the crease area this brush that's where this comes in and is the star of the show it picks up so much products and gets it so tight and dense on that eye and makes it so dark it's so amazing and because of the fact that it is synthetic and it's not a natural hair it puts so much product on your actual lid and makes it nice and dark which I actually love this brush for that this is not a pencil brush though don't get it confused it's nice and rounded but I would not use this really for blending out the lower lash line unless you have no products on this and you already put products on there and you're just blending it out with this being completely bare then you could use it but I really wouldn't use this as a pencil brush don't use it more for packing on hoping that make sense but speaking of pencil brushes this is the e 18 and this is a great pencil brush you guys have seen use this many times you guys see me use all these many times let's get real this one is really really nice for blending things out it is a little bit of a longer pencil brush so when you're packing like the color on the brush what I do is I make sure not to let let my brush go side to side otherwise you're going to get all the products on the side when using a pencil brush just make sure you go do poop like that to get the products on just up and down and maybe a little swirl and then tap off the excess you don't want to go like this otherwise if you get on the side and now it's going to be sloppy so when you're blending out your lower lash line just boop-boop into the product and then go in and begin just to blend using just the tip of it and that's how you'll get that really nice smooth smoked out lash line and for smoking out that lash line this is the most important brush I physically could not do my makeup without this brush I use it every day and this is the m43 to and it's just a flat definer brush it's completely and totally flat as you can see on the top nice and tight this is the brush that I go in with my blacks my dark brown my dark purples whatever it may be and get nice and tight what is on my face and get nice and tight on that lower lash line to make it get right in there and then I will go in and blend it out with a pencil brush such as this one right here this one is also amazing for like smoking out your top liner you guys have seen me do that a million times or if you're doing a more neutral natural look you can take that the dark brown this brush and just use that strictly for your eyeliner and put it right on your lash line you can also put this underneath of your lashes right here kind of darken up the lash area and kind of tight line these little definer brushes are just so amazing and I just love them so much I can't do my makeup without definer brushes and this one believe it or not is my favorite definer brush I think of all time um this is the e36 again it's from their elite collection it's the last brush so I have to talk about and when I start using this I was like how have I ever gone through my life without this little brush right here this is what I use to highlight my inner corner and it is so perfect once you have a brush like this to highlight the inner corner of your eyes you're just like what am I ever supposed to use ever again like this is the inner corner Queen right here it's just so perfect to get in there and highlight and not make it too messy because with an inner corner highlight if you're using Frost like I do like Mac nylon eyeshadow if you get that down here too far like in this area now it looks like you have bags and if you get it too close to the nose and now it's too much you want that inner corner highlight to be nice and precise and that's what I love about this brush so much so that's it you guys gonna get power to that video like I really hope that you guys enjoy this these are my all-time absolute favorite morphe brush loveable absolute very morphe brushes um at the moment I of course have other ones right here that I really enjoy as well but these are like my ride-or-die homeys for life so if you guys need a June updated one down

alright I get that confuse at the sneeze when you have lipstick on does anyone else drink like this next we have the e 22 and this is a part of the elite collection since I had to be in front of it that's how you know that's how you know he loves you oh my gosh you see Georgie he just sat down and stuff scooted his ass across the floor George what's wrong you got a problem with the Moody I know the e1 makes a bomb-ass microphone just saying every time in front of the mirror and I'm getting I Christina Aguilera on my you don't even know send a little oval round don't you better get this bar two and a half weeks because I'm not with those youtubers who has my act together like let's get real I can hear you always I've been ninja you always forget thishey guys and welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be showing you how to achieve this kylie jenner inspired a makeup look she will this look to the golden glow boards and I just absolutely love it so if you guys do want to see how I achieved it and just keep on watching so I'm gonna start off by priming my eyes using some concealer this is the Maybelline age rewind concealer and I'm just applying it all over my eyes and blending it in with a brush just so that it's evenly blended and it can act as a base for the eye shadow we're gonna be using the eye shadow palette I'm using today is the morphe 35o palette and I'm gonna be taking this warm beige shade first of all and we're gonna be taking this on a blending brush and applying this as our first transition shade not only is this nice and light and will help all the colors we're gonna be applying after this blend evenly but it's nice and warm I definitely notice that Kylie's look did have a nice amount of warmth and bronze enos in it next I'm going to be taking this warm brown yellow toned shade from the palette and we're going to be applying this deeper within the crease to start building up more of that warmth in the crease and also to start building that definition and almost a little hint of smokiness in the crease Kylie's local really wasn't that dark but we do want to apply a little bit of a dark brown to really give it that nice amount of smokiness so I'm applying this with a slightly more pointed brush to really focus this color on the crease area and I definitely did notice that this color did come quite high above the crease so I do want to start bringing a little bit higher than we usually would above the crease area I do also want to be applying this into the outer V area as well to prepare it for the dark brown we're gonna be applying next taking this dark brown shade from that same palette I'm gonna be applying this on the outer V and we want to start booting up that smokiness like I said this is the darkest color we're gonna be applying it's a really soft dark brown it's nothing too harsh or too black in a sense it doesn't look like a black Brown so this just makes it look like a really soft and effortless smokey eye and you do want to again take it up quite high above the crease but you make sure to blend the edges as much as you can again go back into this color as many times as you need to to make sure that that color is nice and opaque in the crease I'm gonna be wiping away these sides of my eye because I did notice that kylie's I was nice and straight and then I'm gonna be taking this a bronzy shade from the palette and applying it onto the center of my lid and then I am taking another gold shade and applying it more onto the inner corner of my lid this just gives it a little bit more brightness towards the inner corner and I could definitely see that Kylie's lid was quite shimmery next I'm gonna be taking some natural false lashes just because I do feel like Kylie was either wearing just mascara or really really natural false lashes so I did want to kind of recreate that look but I don't have really long lashes to begin with so I'm taking these lashes from a makeup addiction I'm just applying them to my top lash line and also applying some mascara to make them blend in a little bit better to my natural lashes next I'm just gonna be priming my skin using my Too Faced hangover primer and I'm just applying this all over my skin just to give my skin a nice amount of hydration before foundation and the foundation I'm taking is the ex1 invisi wear and I'm just blending that in with this morphe kabuki brush and I really like this kabuki brush it's from their new elite collection I'll have the numbers listed down below as always but it's just a really nice brush blended everything in flawlessly I'm also just gonna be highlighting all the areas I would like to bring forward and also conceal so I'm just highlighting under my eyes onto my forehead and also onto my chin and I'm just gonna be blending in at those concealer areas using this littles away about kabuki brush I'm now just sitting my face using my soap and glory instant retouch of powder and I'm just using this new brush I am obsessed with it's one of the more feet elite collection brushes as well and it just set my face so beautifully I will list again the numbers of all the brushes and products down below as always but this brush in particular is just my new obsession I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows off-camera but I will link my tutorial down below next I'm just gonna be taking this brown eyeliner and applying it to my waterline and also applying it onto the bottom lashline I'm just gonna be smudging this out and diffusing it with some of the eyeshadow we used on the outer V of our eye we want this to look nice and smoky but we don't it to look overly harsh so using this brown eyeshadow we'll just diffuse it so there looks nice and blended on the bottom lashline I'm gonna be bronzing my skin now using this shade from the shade and light palette from Kat Von D when it came to Kylie's skin it looked really nice and glowy but it didn't look contoured or overly sculpted so I'm just applying this bronzer with a big Brush in the areas where we would usually contour this will just lightly sculpt the face while still giving us that really nice glow that just surrounds the perimeter of the skin and now I'm just using this bronze highlight from Bobbi Brown and just applying it onto the tops of my cheekbone to finish off and give us that gorgeous glow to finish off the look I'm just gonna be applying some stripped-down lip liner from Mac this is just a nice neutral Brown and I'm just applying it all along my lip line to give us that nice amount of fullness and to really define our shape of our lips next I'm just gonna be applying this lip lacquer from Rimmel just to give it that really nice creamy nude lip I'm just gonna be blending the end with my finger and because it was a little bit too light I just went on top of it with these stripped down at lip pencil and just ran it all over the lips to give it a nice Brown time so guys that is the end of this makeup look I hope you enjoyed another Kylie Jenner inspired makeup look if you did enjoy then don't forget to like this video and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I love you guys so

hopefully I will be moving here but yeah so I saw my with this like intro or this for long today I'm gonna be showing you some new products that I have been using and I'm just really excited about um that have been helping with my makeup application I've been noticing that like my past foundation routine ish has been good like my makeup looks good but for me from like in person I can just see through my makeup I just wasn't liking that you can see my pores you could see you know some of my scarring so I kind of had to like rego I had to go out again and find something that works for me so I have a couple products I'll be showing you guys in this video that have helped me so much with just covering my acne scars my acne just helping my pores look more minimize and Lotso like you know right in your face and just some other products I haven't really worked for me and I just like the way my makeup looks now does it still clean fresh nice so yeah it would help you guys out in that little area there plus I found some products that are good for like combination skin or oily skin so I kind of wanna give this video for you guys too as well um and yeah so my birthday is tomorrow well today is June on June 11th one thing today is January 11th my birthday is tomorrow I'm gonna be going to prices right hopefully I actually get called a vertical don't forget to subscribe to my channel and don't forget to give this video a like and I will see you guys right now we're gonna get to this tutorial like right over here like just yeah okay so to start off with my bare mineral skin longevity sir I'm going to take two pumps of that and just put it all over my face and this is supposed to enhance skin longevity and just give you some moisture this is my favorite right now the Becca poreless matte foundation or not foundation excuse me primer when I tell you it just sucks up all the oil in your face it is so amazing I just I'm so glad that I got a chance to use this then I'm going to be going in with the Mac strobe cream just to give those high points of my face a little bit more of enhancement you know just to give it a little more glow I'm going to go in with my Tarte foundation and I'm gonna use my L'Oreal true match foundation and mix those two together to give me that flawless finish but going back to the Becca poreless matte found on my foundation but the met Rebecca excuse me primer it is so good I it I just have to tell you guys get a sample of it Sephora try it out I'm telling you if you have combination skin like me or oily skin like me it just modifies skin so well and I really really suggest you use it it minimizes pores and yeah it's probably the best primers I've used and I don't even use primer like I don't like primer like that but it has to be one of the best ones I've tried if you've watched my other tutorials you know that these two concealers are my favorite the Maybelline age rewind dark circle eraser and the la girl pro conceal in the color yellow mixed together I love just the way that it covers up my dark circles and highlights my face and I'm just going to take my Beauty Blender and blend out the fine lines and things like that so my good friend ELISA Ashley put me on to the 3d face creator from Ruby kisses and I got this from my local Beauty Supply but I was using the cover FX highlight and contour kit and I have to say that this is just as good as that one as well I love the consistency of it it's very creamy and blendable and I like the color as well so it's almost like kind of the same color that I was using in the cover FX highlight contour kit so if you guys haven't tried this yet I suggest you do it's a great great contour for your face I'm just going to blend out those edges and then move on to setting my highlight with my shiny powder and Lauria Mercier mixed together I like to mix these two together because I like the yellow undertone of the shiny powder and I like the way the Laura Mercier sets the makeup it just she's just so great so moving on to my eye makeup I've been doing this I look a lot lately I'm using the pure minerals blurring concealer brush I love to use this to actually blend out my eyeshadow primer if you guys can see how great it just blends in that product onto your skin these these brushes are amazing I just love them so much I definitely suggest that if you haven't tried pure minerals brushes to give them a try they're really really great I'm going to set that with the leftover shiny powder and Laura Mercier powder and then move on to my Too Faced chocolate bar palette and I'm using my favorite color in this palette it's the salted caramel color and I love this color so much I love the flesh tone color of it and it just such a great color I just can't stop using it I use it every single day I've been using it so much since I've been here in LA and I just been using it so it's actually also using before I even came here but yeah I've just been using it everyday so I'm going to go into my crease and create a nice transition shade and then move on to the color milk chocolate to give my eye a little bit more depth and make it look a little bit bigger and the brush I'm using is the twenty-eighth crease brush from Kanna - it just blend in those colors together after I'm done shading the outer corner of my eye with the milk chocolate I'm going to take this bowl ATM brush in the 772 and take the color semi-sweet and this color is a little bit of a darker Brown and I'm just going to create even more depth and create even more of a shadow bringing it into the almost to the mid crease of my eye if that makes sense and just continue to shade that in now that we're done with the eye shadow we're going to move on to my eyebrows and I'm going to be using the Anasazi eye brow Wiz in the color dark brown comb through them a little bit and then give them some shape and I like to use this to just like create the shape versus using my dip brow because I like to use my dip brow I wish I am gonna be using my dipper on this as well but I like to create the shape first with my brows and then go in with my dip brow and kind of fill in those spaces this dip brow is also in the color dark brown as well and like I said before I'm just going to shade in the sparse areas that I have make my eyebrows appear a little bit thicker than they are I'd really like that thick eyebrow look it's like really popular I just I just love it what it looks on my face as well so yeah I'm just going to do that and then clean up my brows with the Maybelline dark circle eraser and my shiny concealer brush next yes I'm kind of moving ahead so like I said I'm going to be using my shady concealer brush and Maybelline dark circle eraser and the color fair I love this brush she used to clean up my brows that work so well and it just she's so awesome I love it if you guys haven't checked checked out these shiny brushes you should definitely check them out they're really great and they're inexpensive now I'm just going to be taking my powder brush and get reading up getting getting rid of all of the laura mercier and shiny powder on my face and then after I'm done with that I'm going to warm up my face with Ofra and it is their bronzer in the color bronze and gold and going to go around my face with it my forehead my cheeks and then on the lower parts of my chin and on my neck as well then blend all those in together to make sure I don't have any harsh lines then I'm going to move on to my highlight and I'm using offers you do you and I will post that in the link down below they sent this to me and I am an absolute love with it it's such a great highlighter and it's very inexpensive then I'm going to also be using Mac's soft and gentle to go over that I like to use two highlighters guys I just love to be super glowy moving on to my blush I'm going to be using B matte blush in the color Sienna and as you guys can see I have already put on my eyelashes and mascara and eyeliner I'll be posting that down below in the description as well but I'm moving on to my lips and I'm using the NYX liquid suede in the color sandstorm and I've gotten so many compliments about this lipstick everybody loves it it looks so good in person and it's just a perfect nude color I'm going to top that with Ruby kisses brown sugar they're matte lipstick and then I'm going to move on to my hair and I've this is the wig that I made a while ago it was actually a different color you guys can kind of see the different the color that was in there previously I just like dark I just want to go back dark I feel like dark looks so much better on my skin tone and so yeah I went ahead and colored it if you follow me on snapchat you saw that already yes I'm just going to fly down my hair and then I'm going to be using this edge wax by who is bye-bye memories and it is so so good it doesn't flake it's perfect like it's so so good and it really lays those edges down so if you guys can try that if you guys want to try that out you could find at your local beauty supply as well and that's all for this video I hope that you guys enjoyed it don't forget to leave a comment down below what you guys want to see next and don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you're not already and leave a like for this video girl or guy whatever and I will see you guys next time byehi guys welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be a lip swatch and our review on the new colour-pop ultra matte lipsticks I'm so excited to be doing this video just because I picked these up probably about two to three weeks ago I did place one order in for four of them and then I went back to get three more just because I fell in love with them so these are what they look like I did get a variety I just dropped one did get a variety of like nudes and darks like that's all that I wear so these are the ones that I got I only have seven not a lot but I did get these with my own money I did want to share them with you guys just because I feel like they're gorgeous and you guys need to pick them up before I do get into the lip swatch of it I do want to go ahead and do like a review of these so these are only six dollars on the colour-pop website which is I think is a steal because liquid lipsticks these days range from like 14 to like 20 dollars so they're pretty expensive for just one of them before you can get like four of them for the price of one liquid lipstick from like Kat Von D Anasazi these are super super affordable and the quality of them is absolutely amazing the only other liquid lipstick I've ever tried is from Gerard cosmetics but I love the color pop once more just because they're cheaper and the formula is probably the same but better they last all day they don't crack on my lips and they have a variety of so much different colors I haven't tried anasazi au or Kat Von D or anything like that I feel like I don't need to because these were so affordable and the color range is amazing they have from nudes to pinks to Purple's to blues to a green one and from like vampy fall colors obviously from these that I have um yeah I just feel like they're super amazing they're so affordable you guys can just like get two of them try Mel and then go back and get as much as you want and the quality of them is absolutely amazing I they tend to be very drying but that's only cuz through the old trim mat so it's not going to exfoliate and moisturize before you put these on you're going to be good to go there's no problem I just think liquid lipsticks are like the best invention just because I like matte lips and I don't like anything that's gonna rub off throughout the day and these definitely don't rub off I kiss anything and nothing comes off like I'm rubbing it and nothing is coming off like these things are absolutely amazing like I said they're so long-lasting the color range is like out of this world I just think that you guys need to go get these out try them out there's nothing that you can lose of in like six bucks if you don't like it like they're so affordable they're long wearing I just think so much worth the money I just feel like they should be more than six dollars but they're not I'm glad for that but yeah I think I'm done rambling I really do like them and I recommend them to you guys I'm gonna have the link down below to the website so you guys can go and check them out but other than that let me fix my hair and then

tutorial is going to be inspired by Kylie Jenner's makeup and makeup has been absolutely gorgeous recently so I really wanted to recreate one of her recent looks like saw on her Instagram so the first step is going to be applying my primer this is the makeup forever step 1 smoothing primer and I'm just applying on all of my bumpy areas which is basically in the center of my face and then I'm taking my Mac Studio Fix fluid and this is in the color NC 40 it looks very yellow but it is going to blend with my neck I promise all of Mark NC colors do come out very stark and yellow but this is going to blend into my skin perfectly soon I promise I'm just blending that in and building up as much coverage as I need with my Real Techniques miracle complexion sponge just because Kylie's look was really full coverage her skin just looks absolutely flawless so I wanted to recreate that and just make sure my skin looked nice matte and flawless next I'm going to be priming my eyes using my soft ochre Paint Pot this is just going to prep my eyes for any eyeshadow that we're going to apply and it's just going to make it blend really easily then I'm going to take Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and this is just going to be my first transition color and I'm just going to buy a really small amount of that into the crease and then I'm going to take creme brulee which is just another makeup geek shadow and just apply this into the deeper part of my crease Kylie didn't have a lot going on in her crease the main sort of attraction was the lid color so next I'm going to be applying magic act which is one of my favorite makeup geek eyeshadows and this is a foiled one and that's just this color here and this is going to create the most gorgeous shimmery effect and just the most gorgeous just gorgeous gold so it's just amazing so I'm just going to apply this all over with a synthetic brush and this will just create that really gorgeous glistening look that Kylie had then I'm going to be taking shimma shimma which is another makeup geek eyeshadow as you can see I've been loving makeup geek at the moment and just applying that into my inner corners just because I want to create that really nice open eyed effect then I'm just going to take some liquid glitter liner this one is from NYX and just be applying it all on top of where we place that fold eyes shadow just to finish off then I'm just gonna apply some mascara and then we're going to pop on our false lashes I honestly feel like Kylie's lip color and the false lashes are what kind of create this look so go for some really long spiky lashes hers were very long almost touching her brows they were so long and they really opened up our eyes so I am of course going for some really long dramatic lashes and just making sure they blend into my lash line I'm just applying a little bit of liquid liner just where I need to so that it looks as natural as possible then I'm just going to fill in my brows as I usually do I don't have a similar shape of brow to Kylee so I'm just going to go for my normal shape go for whatever you feel suits your face the best so I'm just using some concealer to go underneath my brow then I'm using the Mac waterproof browser which is basically finished but I don't have another brow set or brow mascara so I'm just trying to make the most of it and just putting my brows into place and then I'm just filling them in with Mac's spiked eyebrow pencil then I'm gonna be using my Maybelline fit me concealer and just be applying this underneath my eyes and just kind of taking it down the sides of my nose just to kind of narrow down my nose a little bit Kylie's under-eye highlight was very intense so I'm going to be going with a much lighter concealer as well just on the higher points of my face but first I'm going to apply this onto my forehead and also onto my chin next I'm going to be taking the mineralized concealer from Mac and just be applying this on to the high points of my face this is an NC 15 so it's a very light color but this is going to give me a really nice bright effect and I'm also going to be applying this on to the bridge of my nose just to narrow it down a little bit just because my nose is not as petite as Kiley's unfortunately then I'm taking the miracle complexion sponge by Real Techniques and just doing this to make sure my skin looks all nice and blended together and there are no harsh lines and once I've done that I'm going to go in with a brush also just to make sure that I get into all the little tiny areas I can't reach and for that I'm going to be using my Sigma 3d HD precision brush and you guys know I absolutely love this brush it's the most easiest to concealer brush to use and especially when you want to get into them tiny little areas and you don't have ruined the eye makeup that you just previously applied it's the best I absolutely love this brush and I'm also using that to blend in my nose highlight as well to set my under eyes first I'm using a Tom Ford blush brush and my Mac CC correct powder in the neutralized shade and just using this to Pat it onto my under eyes first because I want to make sure that there are no creases you want to make sure that you catch the creasing before it begins and then I'm just using my sponge to apply that same powder and just start to bake my face this is just going to give us that really gorgeous bright effect it's also going to prevent anything from moving at the same time so I'm just applying this onto the high points of my face and just underneath where my contour is going to go so today I'm going to be cream contouring because you know the Kardashians loved contour and Kylie's face always looks really gorgeous and ruptured so I'm going to be cream contouring and powder contouring today which is not something I usually do but I'm just doing that in all the areas that I want to give the appearance of a sunken in effect I'm doing on these sides of my face on the cheekbones and also on my jaw line and to contour I use the RCM a foundation palette at the moment I'm just dusting away the powder we just applied just because I want to start blending in the contour in the areas where it might blend into the powder a little bit so I want to make sure that's all buffed away and I'm just using that same sponge to make sure it's all blended in and it all looks nice and subtle and then I'm just taking that sponge but I was using before just to clean up underneath the contour now I'm just bronzing my skin to give myself a really gorgeous glowed effect because Kylie does always look quite matte but she does look a nice and bronzed so I'm just making sure to give myself a lot of color just so I look nice and summery because this look is actually really perfect for summer then I'm taking the Bahama Mama bronzer which is one of my favourite powders to contour with just because it still is warm but it's not completely orangie at the same time so I'm just using that in the hollows of my cheeks just to give a little bit more definition and then I'm just going to be applying onto these sides of my forehead as well next we're going to start finishing off the eyes and I'm using a frappe which is also a makeup geek eyeshadow and just taking a fluffy Sigma blending brush and just be applying that onto my bottom lash line and then also be applying some mascara just to balance the top and the bottom lash line and because Kylie's eyes look huge in the picture I'm referring to I'm going to be applying a skin tone pencil into my waterline to make my eyes look larger than they actually are next I'm just highlighting a little bit onto my cheekbones just because Kylie's face does look very matte but I can't imagine she wouldn't be wearing a highlight so I did want to apply a little bit on to my cheekbones just on the highest point and then I'm taking that Bahama Mama bronzer again and just using that to very lightly contour my nose Kylie doesn't usually contour her nose but I feel like I need to it's like my safety net and I just feel like I need to do it so go for whatever you feel suits your face and then I'm just applying a little bit of highlight onto the tip of my nose just to turn it upwards a little bit and then to finish off I went for a really simple matte lip look at the moment I'm using NYX natural lip liner and then I'm taking Mac honey love just because she looked like she had a really cool nude lip going on and then I'm just going around it with stone lip liner just to give a little bit more definition because I kind of felt like my lips with disappearing into my skin a little bit so do whatever you feel suits your skin tone this is of course not for every single skin tone so go for whatever nude lipstick suits you and this is the finished look guys I hope you enjoyed this tutorial please don't forget to comment down below any other videos you would like to see and thumbs up this video because it honestly does help me out so much so like we like button to like this video because it helps me out a ton and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I can't wait to see you guys in my next video and I will talk to you later bye guyshi everyone welcome to my channel this is my first video and it's going to be about what my makeup looks like on a daily basis basically and yeah so hope you enjoy it okay so I've already washed my face with clean and clear daily face wash I think that's way cool and navy are to face some body moisturizer basically okay so once you your face is clean and moisturize what I usually do is go ahead and use a primer but I don't have any left unfortunately alone I use this from benefit to called pore fessional this is a good problem I'd recommend it um and yeah so first thing I like to do is put on my foundation and the one I use well the ones I use are Mac Studio sculpt in NC 30 and Rimmel wake me up in classic beige and why do is come on the back of my hand just a tiny bit literally like this much and then mix it with this one 1/2 a pump and some moisturizer because I find that if I just apply foundation straight onto my face it's a bit heavy and it's kind of cakey because I don't really have bad skin anyway and I don't really need to so let's pick some up about that much on the back of my hand and mix it together and once that's mixed I just use my finger and apply on my face okay once that's all on my face I use this Real Techniques sponge I don't know what this is called but yeah it's really good I love it I ditched everything and it is much cheaper than a beauty blender so why why not and why do you is I just dab up my makeup or for my for my foundation all over my face and once that is all on I just let my face sit for like ten seconds before I put on my concealer okay not that's done I go ahead and use my concealer and I use yes yeah Maybelline sorry packaging's come off but Maybelline Dream Lumi touch and I just apply that wait what color is this ivory yes apply that right onto my eyes in like a triangular sort of shape and I do use a lot of concealer and on the other eye down the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow and my chin and once again I use this sponge like the point yar and just to blend everything in then I just go ahead and use my Mac palette this is called Pro conceal and correct it's in medium deep i use this yellowy so it's shade here just apply a little bit under my eyes because I feel like this well this can see light it's a bit white and so I need to bring the warmth back to my face so I choose my finger time your belt in my eyes side and I feel like this just brightens up my eyes a little bit more - okay and once that is done I go ahead and bronze up my whole face and what I use for this is the bourgeois Paris bronzing powder that is what that looks like and this is in the shade 52 I just use a big fluffy fluffy brush this one's from eBay it came in like a pack of 16 like 10 pounds it's very very cheap and I still have them I've got them about four years ago I think actually really good so I do is to all my brush and runs are tap off any excess and just bronze or my whole face and bring it down to my neck look just so you're not like three different colors okay and once you have your desired darkness I guess what I do is go ahead and contour and for my contour i use the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit I love this it's actually amazing I use it for pretty much everything and the colors I use are is this middle gray Brown sort of color I really like this color because it's not as orange at the other two so it's more it looks more other shadow it is just a bit more natural and this darker Brown right underneath a highlighter shade and I use that with my Real Techniques setting brush I just mix those two colors together on my brush tap off any excess because they are very pigmented and just go right onto my cheek bone if you don't know where your cheekbone is just you can use your finger or a brush or whatever and there's like you feel like a hollow where it should be and that's where you want to contour some lines right here that's where I'm going to contour don't start contouring like right down your face because you have to have like a really obvious line and even if you bend at you it's just going to look crappy I'm just going to pick up my more products don't just slap a load on your face because you can't really work backwards so just start off small with small amounts and then just build off if you need to and I'll bring that up to my forehead a slightly I don't really need to call to my forehead because it's not really big I don't want it to look even smaller so I just tend to stay away from that this one muffled hood a little bit and then I bring it once again pick up more product on the excess and then just contour my jawline it seems sort of like a three shape if you don't really know where to contour do it in like a three and then just I just contour down line nose a little bit I'm just going to go ahead and do it on the other side okay so once your face is contoured how you want it I just go ahead and highlight my face and I use the hourglass highlights are in moonlight I this was literally the only highlighter found that doesn't have like bits of sparkle in it so it just kind of makes you glow into it I'm just shining if that makes sense so this is what that looks like and I use a fan brush also from Real Techniques I don't even tell but okay so I just take some of my brush once again tap of any excess and apply it just above my cheap on the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow and just on my chin so basically where you put your concealer just not on do you want your eyes if that makes sense you can put some just below your contour as well if you just wanted to make it stand out a little bit more so yeah that is what the height looks like okay so once you've done your highlight are I just go ahead and use my blusher and this one some golden rose it's in the number Oh - a lot of people have asked me what i use on my cheeks and is this so i just use this book is another brush will Murr Sal got from eBay and I just follow my lash on the blusher top of the neck dress and with this blusher you kind of half the top of the excess cause it's so pigmented and I apply that right where my contour is and on this side as well you don't need to pick up any more because it some people like to apply it here I find that putting it where my contour is just scoot my shape of my face better and it just looks nicer okay so once my face is done I go ahead and do my lashes um and I use two different mascaras I use lash sensational by Maybelline and Maybelline the falsies volume Express when it comes in scars I don't really waste my money on like Mac or benefit habla because I just feel like they work the same to be honest so there's claim and I use the lash sensational fast and I just kind of take off any excess just so it doesn't read clump up as much and then just apply that show it on to my lashes you can tell your lashes if you want what I just don't really need to ok so once my first layer of mascara is applied I go ahead I wait for it to just dry a little bit and then apply this one a lot of people do ask me on Instagram if I use fake lashes and what brand they are and blah blah blah blah that's all I don't really feel the need to use fake lashes because my lashes are long enough and the ridges really uncomfortable so once my mascara is applied I just go ahead and use my fingers to just rub off any excess on my eyebrows I don't really fill in my eyebrows on a daily basis because there's really no need to so once I done I just go ahead and just put a little bit of color on my lips than the one I'm using it's from Max Factor it is in the shade pink brandy eight to five and it's just sort of like a peachy color that's what that looks like I just dab it okay so once your makeup is finished and you're happy with what it looks like you can go ahead and say it you don't have to do this step it's just what I like to do because when I use powders and stuff I feel like it looks a little bit powdering I don't really like that look so I use the Mac prep and prime fix yet fix plus um I really like this I wouldn't use it if I had early skin because it does make you look a bit shiny that's what I like about it it just makes your face look washed rice and refreshed and stuff so what I do is I just spray that directly onto my face and you can spray how much you want to and I'm running out and just let that dry okay so this is what the final product looks like I hope you enjoyed if you have any video requests or any questions just give it down below and I'll see you

skin so I kind of wanna give this video for you guys too as well um and yeah so my birthday is tomorrow well today is June on June 11th one thing today is January 11th my birthday is tomorrow I'm gonna be going to prices right hopefully I actually get called a vertical don't forget to subscribe to my channel and don't forget to give this video a like and I will see you guys right now we're gonna get to this tutorial like right over here like just yeah okay so to start off with my bare mineral skin longevity sir I'm going to take two pumps of that and just put it all over my face and this is supposed to enhance skin longevity and just give you some moisture this is my favorite right now the Becca poreless matte foundation or not foundation excuse me primer when I tell you it just sucks up all the oil in your face it is so amazing I just I'm so glad that I got a chance to use this then I'm going to be going in with the Mac strobe cream just to give those high points of my face a little bit more of enhancement you know just to give it a little more glow I'm going to go in with my Tarte foundation and I'm gonna use my L'Oreal true match foundation and mix those two together to give me that flawless finish but going back to the Becca poreless matte found on my foundation but the met Rebecca excuse me primer it is so good I it I just have to tell you guys get a sample of it Sephora try it out I'm telling you if you have combination skin like me or oily skin like me it just modifies skin so well and I really really suggest you use it it minimizes pores and yeah it's probably the best primers I've used and I don't even use primer like I don't like primer like that but it has to be one of the best ones I've tried if you've watched my other tutorials you know that these two concealers are my favorite the Maybelline age rewind dark circle eraser and the la girl pro conceal in the color yellow mixed together I love just the way that it covers up my dark circles and highlights my face and I'm just going to take my Beauty Blender and blend out the fine lines and things like that so my good friend ELISA Ashley put me on to the 3d face creator from Ruby kisses and I got this from my local Beauty Supply but I was using the cover FX highlight and contour kit and I have to say that this is just as good as that one as well I love the consistency of it it's very creamy and blendable and I like the color as well so it's almost like kind of the same color that I was using in the cover FX highlight contour kit so if you guys haven't tried this yet I suggest you do it's a great great contour for your face I'm just going to blend out those edges and then move on to setting my highlight with my shiny powder and Lauria Mercier mixed together I like to mix these two together because I like the yellow undertone of the shiny powder and I like the way the Laura Mercier sets the makeup it just she's just so great so moving on to my eye makeup I've been doing this I look a lot lately I'm using the pure minerals blurring concealer brush I love to use this to actually blend out my eyeshadow primer if you guys can see how great it just blends in that product onto your skin these these brushes are amazing I just love them so much I definitely suggest that if you haven't tried pure minerals brushes to give them a try they're really really great I'm going to set that with the leftover shiny powder and Laura Mercier powder and then move on to my Too Faced chocolate bar palette and I'm using my favorite color in this palette it's the salted caramel color and I love this color so much I love the flesh tone color of it and it just such a great color I just can't stop using it I use it every single day I've been using it so much since I've been here in LA and I just been using it so it's actually also using before I even came here but yeah I've just been using it everyday so I'm going to go into my crease and create a nice transition shade and then move on to the color milk chocolate to give my eye a little bit more depth and make it look a little bit bigger and the brush I'm using is the twenty-eighth crease brush from Kanna - it just blend in those colors together after I'm done shading the outer corner of my eye with the milk chocolate I'm going to take this bowl ATM brush in the 772 and take the color semi-sweet and this color is a little bit of a darker Brown and I'm just going to create even more depth and create even more of a shadow bringing it into the almost to the mid crease of my eye if that makes sense and just continue to shade that in now that we're done with the eye shadow we're going to move on to my eyebrows and I'm going to be using the Anasazi eye brow Wiz in the color dark brown comb through them a little bit and then give them some shape and I like to use this to just like create the shape versus using my dip brow because I like to use my dip brow I wish I am gonna be using my dipper on this as well but I like to create the shape first with my brows and then go in with my dip brow and kind of fill in those spaces this dip brow is also in the color dark brown as well and like I said before I'm just going to shade in the sparse areas that I have make my eyebrows appear a little bit thicker than they are I'd really like that thick eyebrow look it's like really popular I just I just love it what it looks on my face as well so yeah I'm just going to do that and then clean up my brows with the Maybelline dark circle eraser and my shiny concealer brush next yes I'm kind of moving ahead so like I said I'm going to be using my shady concealer brush and Maybelline dark circle eraser and the color fair I love this brush she used to clean up my brows that work so well and it just she's so awesome I love it if you guys haven't checked checked out these shiny brushes you should definitely check them out they're really great and they're inexpensive now I'm just going to be taking my powder brush and get reading up getting getting rid of all of the laura mercier and shiny powder on my face and then after I'm done with that I'm going to warm up my face with Ofra and it is their bronzer in the color bronze and gold and going to go around my face with it my forehead my cheeks and then on the lower parts of my chin and on my neck as well then blend all those in together to make sure I don't have any harsh lines then I'm going to move on to my highlight and I'm using offers you do you and I will post that in the link down below they sent this to me and I am an absolute love with it it's such a great highlighter and it's very inexpensive then I'm going to also be using Mac's soft and gentle to go over that I like to use two highlighters guys I just love to be super glowy moving on to my blush I'm going to be using B matte blush in the color Sienna and as you guys can see I have already put on my eyelashes and mascara and eyeliner I'll be posting that down below in the description as well but I'm moving on to my lips and I'm using the NYX liquid suede in the color sandstorm and I've gotten so many compliments about this lipstick everybody loves it it looks so good in person and it's just a perfect nude color I'm going to top that with Ruby kisses brown sugar they're matte lipstick and then I'm going to move on to my hair and I've this is the wig that I made a while ago it was actually a different color you guys can kind of see the different the color that was in there previously I just like dark I just want to go back dark I feel like dark looks so much better on my skin tone and so yeah I went ahead and colored it if you follow me on snapchat you saw that already yes I'm just going to fly down my hair and then I'm going to be using this edge wax by who is bye-bye memories and it is so so good it doesn't flake it's perfect like it's so so good and it really lays those edges down so if you guys can try that if you guys want to try that out you could find

subscribe to my channel if you're not already and leave a like for this video girl or guy whatever and I will see you guys next time byehey guys and welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be showing you how to achieve this kylie jenner inspired a makeup look she will this look to the golden glow boards and I just absolutely love it so if you guys do want to see how I achieved it and just keep on watching so I'm gonna start off by priming my eyes using some concealer this is the Maybelline age rewind concealer and I'm just applying it all over my eyes and blending it in with a brush just so that it's evenly blended and it can act as a base for the eye shadow we're gonna be using the eye shadow palette I'm using today is the morphe 35o palette and I'm gonna be taking this warm beige shade first of all and we're gonna be taking this on a blending brush and applying this as our first transition shade not only is this nice and light and will help all the colors we're gonna be applying after this blend evenly but it's nice and warm I definitely notice that Kylie's look did have a nice amount of warmth and bronze enos in it next I'm going to be taking this warm brown yellow toned shade from the palette and we're going to be applying this deeper within the crease to start building up more of that warmth in the crease and also to start building that definition and almost a little hint of smokiness in the crease Kylie's local really wasn't that dark but we do want to apply a little bit of a dark brown to really give it that nice amount of smokiness so I'm applying this with a slightly more pointed brush to really focus this color on the crease area and I definitely did notice that this color did come quite high above the crease so I do want to start bringing a little bit higher than we usually would above the crease area I do also want to be applying this into the outer V area as well to prepare it for the dark brown we're gonna be applying next taking this dark brown shade from that same palette I'm gonna be applying this on the outer V and we want to start booting up that smokiness like I said this is the darkest color we're gonna be applying it's a really soft dark brown it's nothing too harsh or too black in a sense it doesn't look like a black Brown so this just makes it look like a really soft and effortless smokey eye and you do want to again take it up quite high above the crease but you make sure to blend the edges as much as you can again go back into this color as many times as you need to to make sure that that color is nice and opaque in the crease I'm gonna be wiping away these sides of my eye because I did notice that kylie's I was nice and straight and then I'm gonna be taking this a bronzy shade from the palette and applying it onto the center of my lid and then I am taking another gold shade and applying it more onto the inner corner of my lid this just gives it a little bit more brightness towards the inner corner and I could definitely see that Kylie's lid was quite shimmery next I'm gonna be taking some natural false lashes just because I do feel like Kylie was either wearing just mascara or really really natural false lashes so I did want to kind of recreate that look but I don't have really long lashes to begin with so I'm taking these lashes from a makeup addiction I'm just applying them to my top lash line and also applying some mascara to make them blend in a little bit better to my natural lashes next I'm just gonna be priming my skin using my Too Faced hangover primer and I'm just applying this all over my skin just to give my skin a nice amount of hydration before foundation and the foundation I'm taking is the ex1 invisi wear and I'm just blending that in with this morphe kabuki brush and I really like this kabuki brush it's from their new elite collection I'll have the numbers listed down below as always but it's just a really nice brush blended everything in flawlessly I'm also just gonna be highlighting all the areas I would like to bring forward and also conceal so I'm just highlighting under my eyes onto my forehead and also onto my chin and I'm just gonna be blending in at those concealer areas using this littles away about kabuki brush I'm now just sitting my face using my soap and glory instant retouch of powder and I'm just using this new brush I am obsessed with it's one of the more feet elite collection brushes as well and it just set my face so beautifully I will list again the numbers of all the brushes and products down below as always but this brush in particular is just my new obsession I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows off-camera but I will link my tutorial down below next I'm just gonna be taking this brown eyeliner and applying it to my waterline and also applying it onto the bottom lashline I'm just gonna be smudging this out and diffusing it with some of the eyeshadow we used on the outer V of our eye we want this to look nice and smoky but we don't it to look overly harsh so using this brown eyeshadow we'll just diffuse it so there looks nice and blended on the bottom lashline I'm gonna be bronzing my skin now using this shade from the shade and light palette from Kat Von D when it came to Kylie's skin it looked really nice and glowy but it didn't look contoured or overly sculpted so I'm just applying this bronzer with a big Brush in the areas where we would usually contour this will just lightly sculpt the face while still giving us that really nice glow that just surrounds the perimeter of the skin and now I'm just using this bronze highlight from Bobbi Brown and just applying it onto the tops of my cheekbone to finish off and give us that gorgeous glow to finish off the look I'm just gonna be applying some stripped-down lip liner from Mac this is just a nice neutral Brown and I'm just applying it all along my lip line to give us that nice amount of fullness and to really define our shape of our lips next I'm just gonna be applying this lip lacquer from Rimmel just to give it that really nice creamy nude lip I'm just gonna be blending the end with my finger and because it was a little bit too light I just went on top of it with these stripped down at lip pencil and just ran it all over the lips to give it a nice Brown time so guys that is the end of this makeup look I hope you enjoyed another Kylie Jenner inspired makeup look if you did enjoy then don't forget to like this video and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I love you guys so much I can't wait to see you all in my next video and I want you later bye guyshey everyone and welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to achieve this really soft natural eye look with this bold brown chocolate lip [Music] [Music] to get started today I'm gonna be priming my skin with my Mac natural radiance primer I absolutely love this primer it gives off such a smooth finish and really hydrates any dry areas so I love this for the autumn and winter then I'm taking the L'Oreal infallible 24 hour foundation I absolutely love this foundation I'm just applying it all over the skin I really wanted a nice fullest coverage today and this definitely does do that I did want to apply it with a sponge though just because I feel that when I apply it with a brush it does give off quite a cakey finish so this just really helps to blend it in really seamlessly so I definitely say if you are gonna be wearing this foundation it works really well with a sponge [Music] next I'm just gonna be priming my eyes with some concealer this is the Maybelline age rewind concealer I've been loving to use this as an eye primer recently just because I feel like it's a lot lighter on my eyes my eyes can sometimes tend to get a little bit dry and I just feel like this can be a lot less harsh on my eyes rather than the Paint Pot sometimes and I'm also just making sure to set it so that it doesn't move for my eyes today I'm gonna be taking the Urban Decay Naked 1 palette and taking the color naked I'm gonna be taking this on a big fluffy blending brush and just taking this into the crease and making sure to blend this really well I wanted to create a really natural soft eye today just because the lip is so bold you can totally go for a darker eye if you want to but I did want to keep it as simple as possible so I'm just going for two Mac colors in the crease and one shimmery color on the lid and that's it and next I'm gonna be taking me color buck and I'm gonna apply that more towards the outer be area just to add a little bit of definition to the eyes and also just to lift them a little bit without adding too much darkness like it's not too dark it's still looks really soft and is appropriate for daytime and I am also going back into that previous brush just to make sure that color is really nice and well blended next I'm taking the color virgin and I'm gonna apply this all over the lid I'm using my finger just because I do feel like this does spread out the product evenly without it being too harsh I just wanted to swipe this color on really softly [Music] next I'm gonna apply some false lashes this is totally optional you can go for some natural false lashes or even your own lashes I just really wanted to apply some because we are going for such a bold lip and I do feel like it kind of balances out things really well and I just love these lashes these are the ILA 1 to 6 lashes I've been using these constantly I just feel like it's the perfect amount of volume and length and I just love the way this enhances my eyes so I'm just applying them with some glue and tweezers [Music] I did feel like it needed a little bit of liner so I'm taking my soap and glory super cat liner and I'm just drawing a line on the top of the lash band I'm not gonna be winging out the line or anything I'm just gonna be applying a line of eyeliner and that's it this is just gonna enhance my eyes a little bit more and just give it a little bit more depth [Music] next I'm just gonna apply some mascara to my top lashes just to make them blend into the false ones a little bit better next I'm just gonna be applying some concealer this is the Maybelline fit me concealer you guys know I love this concealer by now it's definitely my favorite I'm just applying it under the eyes on my forehead the bridge of my nose and also on my chin this is not only going to conceal but it's also going to highlight as well so it's just going to give us a really nice highlighted face and really bring those areas forward [Music] to blend that in I'm gonna be using the Beauty Blender again just to make sure that it blends really seamlessly into the rest of my complexion we don't see any harsh lines and the beauty blender does that absolutely flawlessly I absolutely love the finish that a beauty blender gives I don't use a sponge all the time but when I do I just always love the way that my foundation comes out [Music] and also just to blend out these smaller areas I'm gonna be using my finger just to help me out a little bit and also just to get into all those little areas that the sponge can't reach next I'm gonna be setting all the areas I applied the concealer I'm gonna be using my soap &amp; Glory instant retouch powder I know surprise surprise it's definitely my favorite powder so I'm sorry I'm using the same powder all the time but I just absolutely love this one and if you can get your hands on it I definitely recommend that everyone buys this because you will not regret it it's an amazing powder and then taking a larger brush I'm just gonna go on the rest of the face as well just so that my bronzer and everything will gone really seamlessly and everywhere is zapped next I'm just gonna do my eyebrows off camera just because you guys have seen me do it a million times but I will put my eyebrow tutorial down in the description box for you next I'm just gonna take a little bit of that buck color from that palette and just apply it onto the bottom lash line taking some more of that virgin shade that we applied on the lead and just take a small brush and apply it on the inner corner to open up our eyes and then I'm just taking a nude pencil and just applying it to our waterline this will just make our eyes appear a lot brighter and also open them up as well and then to finish off the eye look I'm just gonna be taking some mascara just to it really balance the top and the bottom lashes [Music] next I'm gonna start bronzing my skin I am using the Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light it's been a while since this bronzer has made an appearance but I definitely love this bronzer I stopped using it because I was running out and I didn't want to finish it so I blew it out again because I love using this kind of color for the winter time it's not totally yellow toned it does have a little bit more of that bez tone so it is nice up for the winter so I just prefer using this kind of color in the winter so just applied that all over the outer perimeter of my face and then taking hoola bronzer by benefit I'm just contouring the cheekbones just to give my face a little bit more definition I'm also using that same hoola to contour my nose a little bit as well [Music] for my blush today I'm gonna be taking Mac warm so and just applying a tiny little bit on my cheekbones just to give myself a little bit of color [Music] and then to highlight I'm gonna be using the laura geller gilded honey highlighter I absolutely love this and I'm just applying a fairly small amount nothing too much on the cheekbones and also on the tip of my nose and for the lips today for the star of the show this is definitely the main attraction of this look I'm gonna be using Matt chestnut pencil all over the lips now I wasn't sure what kind of brown I wanted to go if for this look but I definitely knew I wanted to go for a brown just because I have seen so many brown shades recently and I personally have never done this on my channel before and I've actually don't think I've ever worn this kind of color before so I just knew I had to do it at least once and I actually really loved it I think I'll be doing this color a lot more I just lined all of my lips with it and then also filled in although I did make sure to moisturize my lips before hands just because this can be very drying so guys that is the end of this makeup tutorial I hope that you enjoyed although it is something a little bit more simple it's definitely something I love you guys were requesting a more simple eyelet with a bold lip you can totally substitute the brown for any lip color you want I just really wanted to do something a little bit different I didn't want to do something typical like the dark purple I do sometimes and also red I wanted to change up a little bit and if you haven't tried brown I definitely recommend it because although I'm not a bold lip person I am loving this if you did enjoy this video then please give it a thumbs up because it does help me out a ton and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I

taking the color rose day and placing this all over my legs so here I picking up the color beige and I'm using it to highlight my inner tear duct and inner court next I'm picking up the shade cocoa and I'm going to use this to start to create an outer and the last shade I'm taking is the color black I'm going to use this to define the outer V a little bit more just so we can deepen up the outer corners using cocoa again I'm just going to line my lower lash line here I'm just reapplying the shade rozay just to make sure we didn't lose that color next I'm applying my liquid eyeliner and of

makeup on my last video and i'll link that down below and i also like to use the same concealer to highlight the rest of my face next I'm setting my under eye concealer with a translucent powder and then after that I'm going to set the rest of my face next I'm taking my too faced chocolate soleil bronzer and I'm going to use this to contour my face I just recently picked this up and it's really

guys enjoyed this video leave me any requests if you have any in the comments below and I'll see you guys in my next video bye guyshey guys welcome back so today I have eight get ready with me video so I'm just going to jump right in and start with my eyebrows today I'm using my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Pro palette and I'm using a Anastasio brush as well and I'm just going to lightly fill in my brows today we're going to be using all makeup geek shadows so taking the shade creme brulée we're going to take a blending brush by morphe brushes and we're going to apply this into our crease because this is going to work as our transition shade taking the Vegas lights palette I'm going to take the shade roulette and I'm going to apply this into my crease I am using a sigma brush as always I will list the name of it in the description box below and I'm going to apply this all the way into the inner corners of my eyes I do really like this palette I feel like it's super unique because I don't have any colors that are similar to it and make a peak shadows you guys know are really good and they're super affordable so I'm thinking about doing a video with just my favorite shades because there's so many but I have like a little small palette which is like twelve of my favorite top makeup peak shadows so if that's something that you guys will want to see just let me know and I will love to do it for you guys on my lid I went ahead and applied Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and then I'm using my Inglot gel 77 eyeliner as well as a morphe brush you so if you follow me on snapchat you probably already know that my boyfriend is another country right now so he was facetiming me and I was like I miss you I miss you so much but I'm filming right now and I kind of reminded me of when we were in high school used to play baseball and we had like a long-distance relationship for like months a really long time and it just brought back all those memories so I just found that kind of funny so it's just crazy how like small things bring back so many memories but I'm going away of topic so let's go ahead and keep on with the makeup tutorial for a foundation today I decided to use my makeup forever matte velvet in the shade 40 I know you guys say that this foundation is a little bit too light for me but you have to realize that the foundation does oxidize and I used to wear 53 I started wearing 53 because you guys said that it was a little bit lighter but then 53 started to oxidize even more so it looked really dark on my face and it just it just looked really bad so I'm going back to 40 I really like how it looks on my skin and I applied it with a simply spoiled cosmetics punch which I really like and then I'm going to go in and apply my concealer and my highlight using a morphe brush this new collection by morphe brush is not even being sponsored by them but it is amazeballs you guys it's so good it's so soft and it feels super expensive to set my t-zone and my under-eye concealer I'm using a a new palette by simply spoiled cosmetics and I'm taking the yellow shade with this morphe brush it's also part of their collection just look at it it's so freakin good and it's super soft you guys to contour today I'm going to be using my favorite palette and it's the two-faced shizzle to perfection contour kit and I'm using in your brush this is the NARS eater brush the infamous brush I do really like it I feel like I don't have anything that's like it just because the bristles are super soft I have heard of people say that there's have fallen out but my friend Amy told me if you washed it a lot that happens so I'm going to take a really good care of it now moving on to my hair I'm going to apply some dry shampoo as always you guys know I love dry shampoo and I'm working on second day hair my hair like I told you guys before is super oily I cannot control it and that's just something that I have to deal with so this dry shampoo that I've been using is called a mica and you can find it at Sephora it's really good it doesn't have any residue you guys saw when I sprayed it on my roots it didn't have any left over so that's something that I really like and it smells so good it actually smells like you just left the salon and your hair is freshly done except in reality it's all by the way how cute does Mark look he looks so freaking adorable and I took him to get a haircut today and he's just like he's feeling post-acute like I'm feeling myself home so I went ahead and applied an accessibility health liquid lipstick and turn Hollywood this will be always one of my favorites I just love love love this lipstick so today I felt like whitening my teeth and today I'm using a new set which I haven't used before but on the first try my teeth were like two shades lighter so I do really like it so what I like to do is I like to apply it in the container and then I put it in my mouth for five to ten minutes so if I have to put on any jewelry which I do like my watch my bracelets and actually these bracelets that I'm going to show you right now they're from luck always the website that you can customize bracelets necklace earrings just a whole bunch of stuff and just how adorable is it it has a DNC for Dianna Chantal and actually have the necklace as well which is super pretty if you haven't seen it on my snapchat you go see it right now just go see it for my nails today I'm just going to remove my nail polish and I feel like this is just magic in a bottle it removes it super fast and I'm just going to go with something nude because that's what I'm feeling right now and this nail polish actually mentioned in my last video which if you haven't seen go see it because it's a fashionable and I really like it it's called topless and barefoot by Essie and then moving on to my outfit and of course McAvoy always has to be in the video my shoes are from Saks Fifth Avenue my skirt is from TJ Maxx and my top is from forever 21 I hope you guys enjoyed this video as always I love you all so much thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all very soon in my next video bye guyshi guys welcome back to my channel today's video is gonna be a false fire look just because I did pick up some makeup geek eyeshadows and they're all warm tones so I wanted to do a video on this fall inspired look just because I know a lot of people have been doing this at Li but since I am just starting out with eyeshadow I did one to kind of like practice so this is what I came up with and I thought it looked pretty good I mean you know for my first time actually some experimenting with eyeshadow so I didn't like how it came out it's all matte with like a cranberry matte lip as well I hope that you guys liked this video I hope that it's helpful I just wanted to do that in the kind of branch out and try new things so yes I hope that you guys like this kind of be easy on me with this just because I'm still starting now so I'm just not gonna be a perfect eye shadow tomorrow at all it is gonna be a full face I forgot to mention that if you guys want to see how I got this look go ahead and keep watching and I'll see you guys in my next video youhey guys today's makeup look is a very simple look that I personally like to wear whenever I'm wearing a very bold lip because it really makes the lip color stand out and today I'm going to show you with brown lips which I personally have been loving lately so if you guys want to know how to get this really simple look then please keep watching after the awkward posing brought to you by yours truly thank you I hate posing so freakin much so I'm starting off with nothing on my skin I am using my L'Oreal infallible Pro matte foundation and I'm in thick coloured caramel beige I like to apply this with either a brush or my fingers and then I take my damp sponge with two drops of my purse all eight rolls elixir and I really belong this out onto my skin as you guys know who've been watching my past few videos you guys probably sick of this routine but I love it I really suggest you guys try it out it is amazing for my concealer today I'm using this one from Marc Jacobs to be honest I don't really recommend this concealer please don't waste your money on it like I did because it will crease on you and it will crease bad I had to learn the hard way I wore this concealer a couple times and then by the end of the night I was like why do I look like a melted candle what is going on under my eye and then I realized that it was this concealer which made me really sad because I love everything else in the Marc Jacobs Beauty line all the products are such high-quality I talk about them all the time but this one just really missed the mark for my contour today I'm using the Tom Ford shade and illuminate which is a life holy grail for me I love this I will continue the purchases for the rest of my life and I'm just using the same brush that I applied my concealer with because I'm lazy like that I just wiped it off on a paper towel and then went through with the contour oh hey creepy contoured face so now I'm just going to blend out my contour first I'm using this brush from zoeva which is my favorite contour blending brush ever it blends it out so seamlessly and I feel like it's like the perfect thickness the perfect density the perfect everything so I just blending out the contour first I personally probably would not contour and highlight at the same time again I just wanted to try something different and it's not a method that I enjoy I like to do one thing at a time I my food like that too like I eat one thing at a time and I don't know why that's relevant to this tutorial but yeah the more you know about me I guess so now I'm just blending out the highlighter with my damp sponge and by highlighter I mean my concealer now I'm just going to go through and set that concealer in place I'm using my Marc Jacobs insta mark light filtering powder and I'm using the yellowish shade just to set the centers of my face and my under eye and I'm going pretty heavy with setting this concealer in place because like I said earlier it does crease on you heart break emoji here so now I'm just going to go through and bronze my face I'm using the chocolate Soleil bronzer from Too Faced and this is indie color milk chocolate I think I'll have it in the description box below I got this as a point part from so forums been lasting forever and then for my blush today I'm using this one from Mac I think it's called sweet as cocoa but again I'll have the name in the description box below for my highlighter today I'm using one of my favorites ever and this is by Becca and this is called opal and this is a really nice pinky it's not only pink it's like a champagne color but it has less golden and in which I personally like whenever I'm wearing a really deep lip color and I just like this with brown lips in general so really going ham on the globe because I love me some glow now I'm moving on to the eyebrows look at that highlighter MA - my favorite filling in my eyebrows with my own associate Brahmas indeed color evany and I'm just filling in my brows how I normally fill in my eyebrows I was not having a good bra day this day as you can tell huh kept messing them up and then I'm going to set them in place with by anastasiya clear brow gel for my eyes today I'm just going to blend out whatever concealer may be on my lid and I'm taking this color from my Kat Von D shade and light palette love this palette it's a definite must-have and I'm just applying a wash of this all over my entire lid this is just going to neutralize the lid it has the slightest shimmer it's not really a shimmer it's a satin finish I shadow I love the way this eye shadow looks I wear this eye shadow all the time and I said eyeshadow like eight million times now I'm grabbing the matte black on my favorite angled brush ever this is the 263 from Mac and I'm lining my lash line with this and flicking it up and smoking it out and I'm creating a very elongated wing with this this is my favorite eyeliner look to where I feel like it's so flattering for everybody and it's it's foolproof you cannot mess this eyeliner up and if you do it's okay because it's just shadow and you can just wipe it right away as opposed to like a gel liner a liquid liner so try this out and love it and I love the Kat Von D eye shadow because it's so black and so pigmented so I just like to build up that color and smoke it out now I'm taking my NARS via veneto eyeliner this is just a black and I'm applying this to my tight line this is just to thicken up the lash line and make my lashes look thicker and darker and who doesn't like nice dark lashes for my mascara today I'm using a new favorite which is the Marc Jacobs velvet noir mascara I've been using a lot of Marc Jacobs in this video Marc Jacobs I've just been loving the last little while all of the makeup from their line this mascara is beautiful but it does flake a little which I don't like for the price but I mean I love the way it makes my lashes look so I'm okay with a little bit of flaking I'm also applying this on my lower lashes to open up the eyes and I'm not putting anything on my lower lash line because I really want the focus of this look to be that beautiful cat winged the glowing skin and that chocolate brown lip for my lip color today I'm using the Kylie lip kit in the color true Brown Kay I'm using the liquid lipstick first and then I'm going through with the lip liner that comes in the kit to fix my lip shape so just a little side note these lip kits were not sent to me I paid for them with my very own money and they sold out so quick I'm surprised I was even able to get them but my honest review of these I was not expecting them to be as good as they are I was so pleasantly surprised when I tried them on i was like whoa this is probably the most comfortable high quality liquid lipstick i have ever worn it doesn't even feel drying or anything like that it is so comfortable i love them they are sold out so i will have similar colors for you in the description box below i got you covered so there is the entire lip done I really hope you guys enjoyed this video please don't forget to give it a great big thumbs up if you did subscribe if you want to see some more of me and some more of my awkward posing believe it or not I am so camera shy if somebody's taking a picture of me my lip will go from zero to twitch real quick I'm just the most Awkward human being of life you guys so much for watching and supporting the weirdness that is me I'll see you in my next one hi youhey guys and welcome back to my channel so today what we're gonna be doing as a makeup tutorial yeah eyes notice the lighting is a little bit different my ring light finally came in and I gotta say I'm loving it I don't know how I've been doing YouTube and beauty stuff for as long as I have without one are a little bit privacy but like I'm upset you guys can already tell the quality of this video is so much better I'm just really excited for today's makeup tutorial I decided to use the morphe 35o palette it came back in stock two weeks ago I thought that people would start getting their palettes in so why not film a tutorial using one so maybe you guys can come up with some looks or if you don't have the 3500 or so many brands that sell single shadows like this and also morphe also sells these in single shadows I'm pretty sure so this is what the palette looks like as you guys see it's like literally my heaven warm tones I mean some cool talents but mostly warm tones and it's gorgeous you guys did not get your hands on it I don't know if it's still in stock if it is I will link it in my description bar down below that's all that I have to say I love you guys and if you guys want to see how to achieve this makeup look and then just keep watching do you guys thought this video was gonna be a little bit different but it's not we're gonna be taking Peach Smoothie from makeup geek and we're gonna be using a 224 from Mac and we're just gonna be using this as our transition shade like I said before it doesn't matter what palette I'm using what shadows I'm using this shadow is always going to be in my crease as a transition color it's just closest to my skin tone I love warm colors even if I'm doing a cool toned look I will always go in with this first starting with a transition shade makes it super easy to blend out shadows later on especially if you're doing dark colors even if you're doing light colors you want like that seamless blend so always transition colors alright so now we're taking the morphe brushes 35o palette and I'm taking this cranberry warm shade and we're gonna be using a Mac 217 and applying this first in our outer corner and then we're gonna be bringing that all the way through so I'm building up the pigmentation of this I love morphe brushes shadows I think that they're a great quality for the price that they're at they're like two dollars a single shadow I think it was 20 something for this whole entire pallet there's like five rows of multiple colors and I'm obsessed with this so now we're just taking this warm shade it kind of looks like Peach Smoothie and we're just gonna blend out the edges of this orange shade because it was getting a little too like harsh for me so I just wanted to blend that out to make sure that it's like a nice gradient from dark to light so this is really similar to Peach Smoothie except I think it's a little bit darker than that and like I have a thing about this palette guys it is so good I don't think that they're as good as makeupgeek but they're good for two dollars and now we're taking this same shade but it's a little bit darker so the first shade we used is really similar to this one except this one is darker and I'm taking out a pencil brush and just deepening up the crease I really really really want some depth in this outer corner since we're gonna have a really highlighted inner corner I want there to be that luck light in the inner corner to darken the outer corner super contrast I just love the way that that looks and I like myself a really defined crease I don't think I've ever done a look that doesn't have a defining to crease I mean to be totally honest with you guys and now we're just taking a little bit more of that transition shade and we're blending out the warm shades so I'm just kind of going in and blending as we go and now we're taking Americano from makeup geek I know I had to use some makeup geek shades there wasn't a really dark color that I liked that was warm in this palette cuz I want to keep this a pretty warm look and I'm taking the same pencil brush and then focusing this just on that outer corner for some more depth you're gonna have to layer colors that's how you're gonna get some depth in your eyes lighter and darker um the more colors you use the more depth you're going to see and now we're just taking this 217 with nothing on it and we're gonna be blending out the edges I really go back and forth so many times to blend and now we're taking that inner corner color which reminds me so much of in the spotlight from makeup geek so this is a great dupe for that if you guys didn't want to spend $6 on that or $9 however much that is this palette has that shade in and I'm pretty sure morphe sells all of these shades singly I'm not 100% sure but you guys can definitely check but I'm pretty sure they do and now we're just taking the 217 and blending where the inner corner shadow meets the outer corner because it really does leave us such a stark line and I don't like that at all so now we're gonna be taking their real mascara and just applying some mascara before lashes like I said before you have to apply mascara before or you're gonna cut down the life of your lashes and then we're gonna be applying some duo lash glue on the lashes you guys know best lash glue smells like fish all right so I didn't apply my lashes on camera again whoops sorry guys and now we're gonna be taking my two favorite primers makeup forever step1 equalizer and smoothing and I use this one first to fill in my pores I don't you guys just want to keep me matte cuz it doesn't so I use it just to fill in my pores and smooth out my skin and then I take that Becca ever matte primer which keeps me so mad and I'll just apply that in my t-zone area and it really absorbs my oil and now we're taking the Sephora infusion foundation and the number 20 and I'm just taking my finger and dotting it all over my skin first like I said before I feel like this is the best way to apply foundation so you're not ending with so much on your skin and you're not gonna be packing it into your brush and your wasting product so now I'm just adding all over my face and starting to blend it in with a sigma f80 flat top kabuki I want you guys to watch how this just makes my skin look so airbrush this is my favorite brush I don't know if you guys own it it's literally on everyone's like list of favorites every youtuber I swear to god has always mentioned this brush but I mean look at what it's doing to my skin obviously it's so worth it so I just kind of like swirl my brush in circular motions and buff this into my skin because I wanted to mesh with it I want my skin to start absorbing the product and I want it to just look like a second layer of skin I don't want it to look like there's like this whole layer of product and it feels like a mask and looks like a mask you guys don't want that either because that just looks too obvious that you're wearing foundation and this one isn't that heavy coverage I mean this isn't definitely a solid medium but as you guys see that little pimple on my forehead it still shows through so it doesn't it just kind of takes away the redness and I like that I don't want like a full caked face that's just not what I prefer I mean if you guys do that is perfectly okay so now we're taking the bare skin bare minerals concealer uh and this is my favorite part of any makeup look concealing my undereyes because as you see you go from hot or not too hot I do I love concealing my under eyes I just feel like it makes the look I love highlighting I like the contrast between the contouring and the highlighting oh I'll always contour and highlight so now we're just gonna take a clean Beauty Blender which I haven't cleaned my nan ages but this is freshly clean thank God and we're just gonna be blending it and lightly the lightest amount of pressure you don't need to beat your face with the Beauty Blender I mean you can if you want I have many times but light pressure will blend it in just fine so as you guys see it just covers all of that darkness and it cancels out it all without having to like cancel it out first so now we're just blending all the rest of the highlight in you want to make sure your highlight is even everywhere or it's just gonna look kind of stark white under your eyes now we're just gonna set it with me balloons translucent powder which is my favorite guys yeah and it doesn't leave that stark white so it's got like a little tint to it it's not like a white powder which I love because when you take flash photography which I noticed this weekend it does not give you that foundation flash back your skin looks like it does in person which I love because I've tried many translucent powders that when you take flash photography I literally look like Casper the Friendly Ghost and I'm not even kidding like white so I'm glad this one doesn't do it and now I have to set the rest of my face if I don't set my foundation it literally will peel off like a mask and now we're going to be taking the UH Nastasia contour kit and the shades fawn and Java and mixing them together on the brush and contouring my face so I'm contouring and bronzing kind of at the same time I'm using the fawn shade as the contour the more cool tone and then I'm using Java is that warm shade kind of bronze up I feel like it's so easy to kind of just do it in one step instead of contouring and then bronzing I think that this just does it really nicely it's not too orange and it's not too cool it's just a nice mixture on my cheeks and it warms me up and I don't look one dimensional anymore and now we're gonna contour my forehead just keep going over that pimple I mean make it more obvious and you guys know I love contouring my forehead I say it in literally every video because bitch needs that and then my other favorite part I love cutting my contour so I'm just taking the translucent powder and I'm making a sharp line if you guys want to see a full highlight contour baking routine let me know in the comments down below and I can definitely film one of those for you I just love cutting my contour and baking underneath I think it just makes everything look so clean and so precise and it's my favorite so now we're taking six Sigma's blush in heavenly and this is just a warm blush I don't even mean to make this a full warm tutorial but I just love a subtle blush and this one is probably one of my favorite and now we're gonna be taking a champagne pop by Jacqueline Hill and Becca cosmetics I have not used this in so long and it's my absolute favorite highlight do you guys see how it just gives you that subtle glow but I mean you can take it top notch which you guys will see that I do but I like that it's subtle and it just makes you look like you're glowing from within and not like you just have like glitter all over your cheeks which I can't stand I feel like I like it to be like just a glow from within like you're just beaming and now we're gonna be wiping away that translucent powder after we let it set and then I'm just gonna be blending that in because I hate having a harsh line I feel like it's so unflattering so make sure to blend and now we're gonna be taking Sigma e21 brush and we're just using the same shades that we used in the top portion of our eye in completing the eye by blending out the bottom I feel like if you do this it really completes it and it really makes the eye look just come together so we're just taking all the shades in this pencil brush to blend everything out as you guys see compared to the other eye it just doesn't look complete so make sure to always apply something if anything on your lower lash line and just taking this big fluffy brush and a little bit of that shade from the morphe 35o and blending it out and guys sorry for all these crazy faces they make but we all make these makeup faces sometimes when I'm watching my tutorials I'm like oh my god like am I the only one who makes these faces and I'm like no there's no way so now we're gonna be applying some mascara on the lower lash line and this is the voluminous carbon black from L'Oreal you guys know I've been I raved about this in my favorites video it's just beautiful do you see what it does for my lower lashes it just makes them thick and fluffy and not like long and spidery which I don't have time for long in spite of her lashes I think that's super unflattering so we're just taking this and going from the root and wiggling out to extend my lashes and now we're taking this liquid lipstick from Kat Von D in bow-and-arrow and it's really similar to Lime Crime cashmere but I mean we all know Lime Crime so I mean I'm not gonna bring anything up but I will not be purchasing from them so this is the closest shade I have found it's really similar to sepia also but i swatched these two next to each other and sepia is a lot darker so this one is more of like a brownish gray and sepia is more of like a grey grey so I think this is something you can wear every day it does not look crazy on the lips I think it's more of like a pinky nude with I mean like a brownie nude then anything and I really loved how this looked with this entire look it just pulled it all together it was something neutral on the lips which was definitely needed so that is all that I have for this video guys I hope you guys enjoyed I love you guys and don't forget to subscribehey guys welcome back so today I have eight get ready with me video so I'm just going to jump right in and start with my eyebrows today I'm using my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Pro palette and I'm using a Anastasio brush as well and I'm just going to lightly fill in my brows today we're going to be using all makeup geek shadows so taking the shade creme brulée we're going to take a blending brush by morphe brushes and we're going to apply this into our crease because this is going to work as our transition shade taking the Vegas lights palette I'm going to take the shade roulette and I'm going to apply this into my crease I am using a sigma brush as always I will list the name of it in the description box below and I'm going to apply this all the way into the inner corners of my eyes I do really like this palette I feel like it's super unique because I don't have any colors that are similar to it and make a peak shadows you guys know are really good and they're super affordable so I'm thinking about doing a video with just my favorite shades because there's so many but I have like a little small palette which is like twelve of my favorite top makeup peak shadows so if that's something that you guys will want to see just let me know and I will love to do it for you guys on my lid I went ahead and applied Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and then I'm using my Inglot gel 77 eyeliner as well as a morphe brush you so if you follow me on snapchat you probably already know that my boyfriend is another country right now so he was facetiming me and I was like I miss you I miss you so much but I'm filming right now and I kind of reminded me of when we were in high school used to play baseball and we had like a long-distance relationship for like months a really long time and it just brought back all those memories so I just found that kind of funny so it's just crazy how like small things bring back so many memories but I'm going away of topic so let's go ahead and keep on with the makeup tutorial for a foundation today I decided to use my makeup forever matte velvet in the shade 40 I know you guys say that this foundation is a little bit too light for me but you have to realize that the foundation does oxidize and I used to wear 53 I started wearing 53 because you guys said that it was a little bit lighter but then 53 started to oxidize even more so it looked really dark on my face and it just it just looked really bad so I'm going back to 40 I really like how it looks on my skin and I applied it with a simply spoiled cosmetics punch which I really like and then I'm going to go in and apply my concealer and my highlight using a morphe brush this new collection by morphe brush is not even being sponsored by them but it is amazeballs you guys it's so good it's so soft and it feels super expensive to set my t-zone and my under-eye concealer I'm using a a new palette by simply spoiled cosmetics and I'm taking the yellow shade with this morphe brush it's also part of their collection just look at it it's so freakin good and it's super soft you guys to contour today I'm going to be using my favorite palette and it's the two-faced shizzle to perfection contour kit and I'm using in your brush this is the NARS eater brush the infamous brush I do really like it I feel like I don't have anything that's like it just because the bristles are super soft I have heard of people say that there's have fallen out but my friend Amy told me if you washed it a lot that happens so I'm going to take a really good care of it now moving on to my hair I'm going to apply some dry shampoo as always you guys know I love dry shampoo and I'm working on second day hair my hair like I told you guys before is super oily I cannot control it and that's just something that I have to deal with so this dry shampoo that I've been using is called a mica and you can find it at Sephora it's really good it doesn't have any residue you guys saw when I sprayed it on my roots it didn't have any left over so that's something that I really like and it smells so good it actually smells like you just left the salon and your hair is freshly done except in reality it's all by the way how cute does Mark look he looks so freaking adorable and I took him to get a haircut today and he's just like he's feeling post-acute like I'm feeling myself home so I went ahead and applied an accessibility health liquid lipstick and turn Hollywood this will be always one of my favorites I just love love love this lipstick so today I felt like whitening my teeth and today I'm using a new set which I haven't used before but on the first try my teeth were like two shades lighter so I do really like it so what I like to do is I like to apply it in the container and then I put it in my mouth for five to ten minutes so if I have to put on any jewelry which I do like my watch my bracelets and actually these bracelets that I'm going to show you right now they're from luck always the website that you can customize bracelets necklace earrings just a whole bunch of stuff and just how adorable is it it has a DNC for Dianna Chantal and actually have the necklace as well which is super pretty if you haven't seen it on my snapchat you go see it right now just go see it for my nails today I'm just going to remove my nail polish and I feel like this is just magic in a bottle it removes it super fast and I'm just going to go with something nude because that's what I'm feeling right now and this nail polish actually mentioned in my last video which if you haven't seen go see it because it's a fashionable and I really like it it's called topless and barefoot by Essie and then moving on to my outfit and of course McAvoy always has to be in the video my shoes are from Saks Fifth Avenue my

decided today to do my daily makeup routine which I belong through for a really long time but I finally did it so yeah here it is and if you'd like to see just continue watching first I start off with my NYX Born to glow illuminating primer I'm just going to apply it all over my face and I love the way this primer makes my face look throughout the day it keeps my face looking all glowy and aluminous then for my foundation I am going to be using it cosmetics foundation in the shade medium it's pretty medium to full coverage I'm just going to use a damp Beauty Blender beauty blenders are amazing they leave a very natural and dewy finish to your foundation which makes a huge difference apply this all over your face then I'm going to be applying my matte concealer in the shade nw15 a little goes a long way with this concealer I'm just going to put a small amount on my hand and then use that damp Beauty Blender again to blend in the small triangles under my eyes on the bridge of my nose a little on my forehead on my chin and below my eyebrow to highlight my brow bone then I'm going to take my 8 Cosmetics translucent powder and I'm going to bake my face I just recently started doing this I've seen a lot of people do this and it makes my highlight last all day my contour look a little bit more defined what you do is you just put translucent powder where you just highlighted your face and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes I'm going to take this Mac bronzer and a shade harmony with a fan brush and just find the hollows of my cheek bones and contour then I'm going to contour my nose my temples under my lips to make them look a little powdery then anywhere else that creates natural shadows on my face then I'm going to blend out the translucent powder with a fluffy NYX brush now onto my eyes I'm going to be using the buxom eyeshadow palette and a fluffy it cosmetics brush I'm going to be using the gold color and I'm going to be applying it onto my eyelid then with the same fluffy brush I'm going to take the brown color next to the gold and put it into my crease in my eye and blend it out after that I'm going to take the lightest almost white highlight color and put it right underneath my brow bone now I'm going to highlight my cheekbones I'm going to take a bigger fan brush from NYX Cosmetics and a highlighter from Mac called soft and gentle I'm going to apply it right above my contour then I'm going to smoke up my eyes a little bit more this is actually an eyebrow palette from ardell but I'm using it as a smoked out eyeliner I'm using this eyebrow brush from NYX I'm going to take the darkest brown shade and apply it under my lower lash line and smoke it out and then I'm going to do the same thing on my upper lash line now with that same brush I'm going to brush my eyebrows upward then use my Anastacio brow gel and soft brown I naturally have really dark eyebrows so I'm just going to follow the shape of my brow and just fill them in a little bit now onto lashes I'm going to be using the Maybelline falsies push-up drama mascara I'm just going to apply a few coats onto my lashes then I'm going to apply a few layers to my bottom lashes as well Oh Oh and lastly I'm going to move on to my lips I'm going to be using this pallid IO herbal lip liner and the shade naked then over line my lips just a little bit for a fuller look I'm going to take the lip liner and use it almost as a lipstick and fill in my lips a little bit I'm going to take my highlighter out again and apply a little bit to the center of my lips so my lips look a little bit powdery err that is the end of my daily makeup routine I hope you guys enjoy it if you did please give this video a like and subscribe to my channel I post videos every Monday for hashtag majestic Mondays and please check out my social media everything will be in the description box below I love you all so so so much and stay majesticlike I'm rude hey guys so in today's video I'm going to teach you all how to achieve this makeup look it's inspired by Instagram pages that post pictures of like baddies and I'm not calling myself a baddie in any way I mean I just copy their makeup a lot of you guys have requested this tutorial because I wear this makeup look in countless videos so if you want to see how I've created and slick and then continue watching so this tutorial I'm going to do like talk-through style I feel like it gives like a better description on how to actually do the makeup so I have nothing on my face right now I just like tea tree water which is like toner don't leave a comment about like what the heck she looks so different without makeup let's just go on with the look because that's what you guys came here to see I always start out with my eyebrows just because I like to clean them up with concealer and it doesn't like get in the way of the rest of my makeup I'm going to zoom you guys in you just want to comb out your brows and you want to do so with a spoolie and you want to take your pomade which is by anastacio and your angled eyebrow brush and I always start to like the middle to tailor my brows it's gonna look super harsh if you start out at the beginning and we do not want that we've filled in pretty much the whole entire brow and now you just want to kind of sparsely feel in the front not a ton and now that your eyebrows like fill in you just want to take your favorite concealer at once the Mac one and you just want to clean it up a bit around your eyebrows so one like the bottom and then kind of how long you guys are always asking for like an everyday eyebrow tutorial this is pretty much what I do this eyebrow it's like just basic eyebrow and then this one I feel like the meme of like Raven Symone right now which is like a bald eagle if I finish this eyebrow I just send you guys out because next we're going to be working on our face I'm using a Mac Foundation and it's almost out so I'm using this to apply it and then I'm just going to blend it out with a Beauty Blender either your new foundation like you guys need to recommend me some I don't really invest in it often because I don't wear on an everyday basis drag the foundation down your neck you want to blend it you know going in with concealer you just want to pile it all underneath your eye okay this will do for now because I am going to go in with a second layer of concealer after I do my eye makeup because I like to fix up my bottom lash line a little bit with the concealer and kind of brighten everything up but yeah this is like a basic base makeup so yeah what you're going to apply a p-- and we are going to go in with the Too Faced chocolate bar palette because it does have a lot of brown matte shades and that's basically what you're going to use in with the shade mocha you can use bronzer like I said nothing is holding you back here this is going to be one of your main crease colors but it's also a transition so make sure you blend this out a time I just want the edges to be really blended out and kind of seamless and I'm using a Mac 224 brush I use pretty much all Mac and Sigma brushes because they're so soft and they blend really well next I'm going in with the shade Bordeaux and applying this in my crease this is going to be my main crease shade you have to lid options you can either use a gold because I finally use that a lot or you can stick to a matte Brown which is what I'm going to use and this is just mocha once again which is my transition shade I didn't like to go in with a watt Tyler like right here then all of the times I will plot Watts my inner corner but I go back in with my hot water oh that's your finish shadow look other than the lower lash line will go in with a felt tip eyeliner right now and it just make a winged want to do a really long wing so and it's pretty easy for me right now I'm talking about doing my wing this is probably not the best you can take off the tape and it will look like this a really clean and I'm going to line my waterline right here for the picture say a lot of the girls line their waterline and I think it looks good compared with the rest of it I look it kind of balances it out on the lower lash line to match the top so I'm going to go in with a Maybelline Joe honor you then want to go in with your transition shade and use that on your lower lash line this is important because you want to even out the top and the bottom for the sake of this look falsies are a must so I'm going to go off-camera and apply the falsies and I'll see you guys after I do so so I applied falsies I blended in with mine when I lashes mascara and applied mascara on my lower lash line and I did the same thing to the side now it is time to go in with powders and kind of highlight and contour work your magic taking a pretty dense powder brush I'm just going to apply a highlight shade I'm using the Anastasio contour kit I love this I don't really set my foundation with any powder I just use like highlight and contour it once you have that you're going to go in with bronzer I'm going to use like the middle shade from the Anastasia contour kit and just really define my cheekbones because that's important to me especially where I'm so pale I go in and I blend all this out and then I go in again and make the line so this is me just applying it so I can blend it out a ton and get kind of a bronzey effect and also closets to my temples don't want forehead brows really small foreheads I don't really need it also make sure you get your jawline and done your neck with the bronzer my hair looks so weird now that how all this makeup on you want to blend this out heavy like you do not want lon and as you can tell like these areas in my face just stand out a lot more in my cheeks look a lot more defined and that's just basically the goal of contouring and highlighting is to make areas of your face stand out and others look smaller I'm going to go in with that same angled brush and I'm just going to go in with hoola bronzer and apply this as an actual contour and I'm not going to blend this out of ten I'm gonna blend it out a little bit but it's not ten because I do want that kind of define sharp contour line and I'm also going to go underneath my mouth I'm taking a Mac blush brush a one-dollar blush I'm literally it's like a coral shade to make my face have a more angular shape so I'm not applying it to the apples just kind of in an upward motion with the stippling brush okay the next step is the best it's the biggest step of the whole entire look it is hot lighting I'm getting a little bit close here because I want to show you guys a whole lot but first I'm using a cream highlighter and normally I won't do this unless it's very special so not applying a ton of it just seem to kind of use as a base you can blend this out using your hands or Beauty Blender I'm just going to use the opposite into the beauty blender that I don't tend to use a ton yes Queen oh my god taking a small dense powder brush and my Becca highlighter this is my Holy Grail highlighter if it's any representation of how much a whole lot I get paid on this in less than a month highlighting is my everything at the moment so I'm just going to enjoy this trend on my ring finger I'm just going to go in and haul out my nose and you don't want to make your nose look oily it's just gonna look like a lot you don't really have to pour your nose if you do this step check this hollowed out you're finished with everything except for the lips so let's move on to that I'm going in with the Kylie lip kit liner and just over lining my lips a little bit not too much though next I'm going in with the actual Dolce K and I'm just using this feeling all the areas that I get into with the lip liner and yeah it's really beautiful after this goes mad I'm going to go over it with a brave up my Mac this is the longest makeup tutorial ever I feel like my pores are about to scream like free us because this is so much makeup but it looks good though it looks good okay so no but it looked like a different person than before I have to do something with this hair and I recommend if you're going for like the bad you look to just straighten it and wait like naki hat or something or just leave it down like you can part in the middle put it behind your ears let's go do something with this hair and I will come back and show you guys the finished look peace and some games but you already in this like a horse on the carousel Ohhey guys welcome back to my channel today's look is going to be a strong pink and red eye shadow look which is perfect for Valentine's Day it's fairly simple to do but it's doping sex with drama pure look so I hope you enjoy focusing on your inner and outer corners apply the brown orange colors from the revelation had it just building up the colors between inside of the corner connecting it to the middle I now apply a glittery paint color on to the middle part of my eyelid and then I read smoke the edges with a brown color now using the same cutters on the top above my eyelid I had a Browns make sure others have gotten hot mines

didn't know what the outcome would be turned out my camera broke it would not turn on I didn't know what's wrong I was like oh my goodness so it took so long to get it fixed to the point where I thought I was gonna have to buy a new camera and I was like oh my god cameras are so expensive I would rather save that money instead of buying a freaking camera but they fixed it so here I am filming

Smashbox one and this is the best one I feel like this just does the best job of like actually filling your pores and making your skin look like paulus and smooth to pick up a little bit of corrected

here and I'm just going to apply this into my crease and I apply this in like a rounded shape rather than bringing out and I take it all the way in to the inner corner now I'm going to pick up a pencil brush this is the 231 luxe petit crease brush from zoeva and I'm going to grab the share truffled here which is just like a chocolate brown one and I'm just going to apply this into my crease as well I'm just going to apply a little bit of frosting and bond one and I'm going to place this all over the lid and now I'm picking up a little bit of butter pecan and I'm just going to apply this right into the center and now just picking up a little bit of peanut butta again and this is on a wolfy East 17 brush I'm going to place this on my waterline on my lower lash line by donor level and just picking up s Sigma e 15 flat definer brush I'm going to take a little bit of truffled and just place this right now lining my waterline with the Rimmel London exaggerate waterproof eye definer in two one three in the nude and using my Tarte the light camera lashes mascara on lashes now I'm also going to apply some falsies just because that's what I wear in all my Instagram photos and I'm just

using the Mac lipliner in the shade whirl and it's really funny because like everyone over lines their lips but I feel like my bottom lip is too big for my top lip so I underline it like I make it appear small up because I don't know I don't like to over draw my lips because I feel like it's so obvious so I under draw my bottom and now for my lips I'm gonna app a what now for my lips I'm going to apply the Anasazi Beverly Hills liquid lip gloss in the shade undressed and that brings us to the end of today's tutorial so I hope you guys enjoyed this look and if you did then please subscribe to my channel and give this video a thumbs up and I will see you guys next time byehey guys and welcome back to my channel today's makeup tutorial is going to be inspired by Kylie Jenner's makeup and makeup has been absolutely gorgeous recently so I really wanted to recreate one of her recent looks like saw on her Instagram so the first step is going to be applying my primer this is the makeup forever step 1 smoothing primer and I'm just applying on all of my bumpy areas which is basically in the center of my face and then I'm taking my Mac Studio Fix fluid and this is in the color NC 40 it looks very yellow but it is going to blend with my neck I promise all of Mark NC colors do come out very stark and yellow but this is going to blend into my skin perfectly soon I promise I'm just blending that in and building up as much coverage as I need with my Real Techniques miracle complexion sponge just because Kylie's look was really full coverage her skin just looks absolutely flawless so I wanted to recreate that and just make sure my skin looked nice matte and flawless next I'm going to be priming my eyes using my soft ochre Paint Pot this is just going to prep my eyes for any eyeshadow that we're going to apply and it's just going to make it blend really easily then I'm going to take Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and this is just going to be my first transition color and I'm just going to buy a really small amount of that into the crease and then I'm going to take creme brulee which is just another makeup geek shadow and just apply this into the deeper part of my crease Kylie didn't have a lot going on in her crease the main sort of attraction was the lid color so next I'm going to be applying magic act which is one of my favorite makeup geek eyeshadows and this is a foiled one and that's just this color here and this is going to create the most gorgeous shimmery effect and just the most gorgeous just gorgeous gold so it's just amazing so I'm just going to apply this all over with a synthetic brush and this will just create that really gorgeous glistening look that Kylie had then I'm going to be taking shimma shimma which is another makeup geek eyeshadow as you can see I've been loving makeup geek at the moment and just applying that into my inner corners just because I want to create that really nice open eyed effect then I'm just going to take some liquid glitter liner this one is from NYX and just be applying it all on top of where we place that fold eyes shadow just to finish off then I'm just gonna apply some mascara and then we're going to pop on our false lashes I honestly feel like Kylie's lip color and the false lashes are what kind of create this look so go for some really long spiky lashes hers were very long almost touching her brows they were so long and they really opened up our eyes so I am of course going for some really long dramatic lashes and just making sure they blend into my lash line I'm just applying a little bit of liquid liner just where I need to so that it looks as natural as possible then I'm just going to fill in my brows as I usually do I don't have a similar shape of brow to Kylee so I'm just going to go for my normal shape go for whatever you feel suits your face the best so I'm just using some concealer to go underneath my brow then I'm using the Mac waterproof browser which is basically finished but I don't have another brow set or brow mascara so I'm just trying to make the most of it and just putting my brows into place and then I'm just filling them in with Mac's spiked eyebrow pencil then I'm gonna be using my Maybelline fit me concealer and just be applying this underneath my eyes and just kind of taking it down the sides of my nose just to kind of narrow down my nose a little bit Kylie's under-eye highlight was very intense so I'm going to be going with a much lighter concealer as well just on the higher points of my face but first I'm going to apply this onto my forehead and also onto my chin next I'm going to be taking the mineralized concealer from Mac and just be applying this on to the high points of my face this is an NC 15 so it's a very light color but this is going to give me a really nice bright effect and I'm also going to be applying this on to the bridge of my nose just to narrow it down a little bit just because my nose is not as petite as Kiley's unfortunately then I'm taking the miracle complexion sponge by Real Techniques and just doing this to make sure my skin looks all nice and blended together and there are no harsh lines and once I've done that I'm going to go in with a brush also just to make sure that I get into all the little tiny areas I can't reach and for that I'm going to be using my Sigma 3d HD precision brush and you guys know I absolutely love this brush it's the most easiest to concealer brush to use and especially when you want to get into them tiny little areas and you don't have ruined the eye makeup that you just previously applied it's the best I absolutely love this brush and I'm also using that to blend in my nose highlight as well to set my under eyes first I'm using a Tom Ford blush brush and my Mac CC correct powder in the neutralized shade and just using this to Pat it onto my under eyes first because I want to make sure that there are no creases you want to make sure that you catch the creasing before it begins and then I'm just using my sponge to apply that same powder and just start to bake my face this is just going to give us that really gorgeous bright effect it's also going to prevent anything from moving at the same time so I'm just applying this onto the high points of my face and just underneath where my contour is going to go so today I'm going to be cream contouring because you know the Kardashians loved contour and Kylie's face always looks really gorgeous and ruptured so I'm going to be cream contouring and powder contouring today which is not something I usually do but I'm just doing that in all the areas that I want to give the appearance of a sunken in effect I'm doing on these sides of my face on the cheekbones and also on my jaw line and to contour I use the RCM a foundation palette at the moment I'm just dusting away the powder we just applied just because I want to start blending in the contour in the areas where it might blend into the powder a little bit so I want to make sure that's all buffed away and I'm just using that same sponge to make sure it's all blended in and it all looks nice and subtle and then I'm just taking that sponge but I was using before just to clean up underneath the contour now I'm just bronzing my skin to give myself a really gorgeous glowed effect because Kylie does always look quite matte but she does look a nice and bronzed so I'm just making sure to give myself a lot of color just so I look nice and summery because this look is actually really perfect for summer then I'm taking the Bahama Mama bronzer which is one of my favourite powders to contour with just because it still is warm but it's not completely orangie at the same time so I'm just using that in the hollows of my cheeks just to give a little bit more definition and then I'm just going to be applying onto these sides of my forehead as well next we're going to start finishing off the eyes and I'm using a frappe which is also a makeup geek eyeshadow and just taking a fluffy Sigma blending brush and just be applying that onto my bottom lash line and then also be applying some mascara just to balance the top and the bottom lash line and because Kylie's eyes look huge in the picture I'm referring to I'm going to be applying a skin tone pencil into my waterline to make my eyes look larger than they actually are next I'm just highlighting a little bit onto my cheekbones just because Kylie's face does look very matte but I can't imagine she wouldn't be wearing a highlight so I did want to apply a little bit on to my cheekbones just on the highest point and then I'm taking that Bahama Mama bronzer again and just using that to very lightly contour my nose Kylie doesn't usually contour her nose but I feel like I need to it's like my safety net and I just feel like I need to do it so go for whatever you feel suits your face and then I'm just applying a little bit of highlight onto the tip of my nose just to turn it upwards a little bit and then to finish off I went for a really simple matte lip look at the moment I'm using NYX natural lip liner and then I'm taking Mac honey love just because she looked like she had a really cool nude lip going on and then I'm just going around it with stone lip liner just to give a little bit more definition because I kind of felt like my lips with disappearing into my skin a little bit so do whatever you feel suits your skin tone this is of course not for every single skin tone so go for whatever nude lipstick suits you and this is the finished look guys I hope you enjoyed this tutorial please don't forget to comment down below any other videos you would like to see and thumbs up this video because it honestly does help me out so much so like we like button to like this video because it helps me out a ton and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I can't wait to see you guys in my next video and I will talk to you later bye guyshey everyone and welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to achieve this really soft natural eye look with this bold brown chocolate lip [Music] [Music] to get started today I'm gonna be priming my skin with my Mac natural radiance primer I absolutely love this primer it gives off such a smooth finish and really hydrates any dry areas so I love this for the autumn and winter then I'm taking the L'Oreal infallible 24 hour foundation I absolutely love this foundation I'm just applying it all over the skin I really wanted a nice fullest coverage today and this definitely does do that I did want to apply it with a sponge though just because I feel that when I apply it with a brush it does give off quite a cakey finish so this just really helps to blend it in really seamlessly so I definitely say if you are gonna be wearing this foundation it works really well with a sponge [Music] next I'm just gonna be priming my eyes with some concealer this is the Maybelline age rewind concealer I've been loving to use this as an eye primer recently just because I feel like it's a lot lighter on my eyes my eyes can sometimes tend to get a little bit dry and I just feel like this can be a lot less harsh on my eyes rather than the Paint Pot sometimes and I'm also just making sure to set it so that it doesn't move for my eyes today I'm gonna be taking the Urban Decay Naked 1 palette and taking the color naked I'm gonna be taking this on a big fluffy blending brush and just taking this into the crease and making sure to blend this really well I wanted to create a really natural soft eye today just because the lip is so bold you can totally go for a darker eye if you want to but I did want to keep it as simple as possible so I'm just going for two Mac colors in the crease and one shimmery color on the lid and that's it and next I'm gonna be taking me color buck and I'm gonna apply that more towards the outer be area just to add a little bit of definition to the eyes and also just to lift them a little bit without adding too much darkness like it's not too dark it's still looks really soft and is appropriate for daytime and I am also going back into that previous brush just to make sure that color is really nice and well blended next I'm taking the color virgin and I'm gonna apply this all over the lid I'm using my finger just because I do feel like this does spread out the product evenly without it being too harsh I just wanted to swipe this color on really softly [Music] next I'm gonna apply some false lashes this is totally optional you can go for some natural false lashes or even your own lashes I just really wanted to apply some because we are going for such a bold lip and I do feel like it kind of balances out things really well and I just love these lashes these are the ILA 1 to 6 lashes I've been using these constantly I just feel like it's the perfect amount of volume and length and I just love the way this enhances my eyes so I'm just applying them with some glue and tweezers [Music] I did feel like it needed a little bit of liner so I'm taking my soap and glory super cat liner and I'm just drawing a line on the top of the lash band I'm not gonna be winging out the line or anything I'm just gonna be applying a line of eyeliner and that's it this is just gonna enhance my eyes a little bit more and just give it a little bit more depth [Music] next I'm just gonna apply some mascara to my top lashes just to make them blend into the false ones a little bit better next I'm just gonna be applying some concealer this is the Maybelline fit me concealer you guys know I love this concealer by now it's definitely my favorite I'm just applying it under the eyes on my forehead the bridge of my nose and also on my chin this is not only going to conceal but it's also going to highlight as well so it's just going to give us a really nice highlighted face and really bring those areas forward [Music] to blend that in I'm gonna be using the Beauty Blender again just to make sure that it blends really seamlessly into the rest of my complexion we don't see any harsh lines and the beauty blender does that absolutely flawlessly I absolutely love the finish that a beauty blender gives I don't use a sponge all the time but when I do I just always love the way that my foundation comes out [Music] and also just to blend out these smaller areas I'm gonna be using my finger just to help me out a little bit and also just to get into all those little areas that the sponge can't reach next I'm gonna be setting all the areas I applied the concealer I'm gonna be using my soap &amp; Glory instant retouch powder I know surprise surprise it's definitely my favorite powder so I'm sorry I'm using the same powder all the time but I just absolutely love this one and if you can get your hands on it I definitely recommend that everyone buys this because you will not regret it it's an amazing powder and then taking a larger brush I'm just gonna go on the rest of the face as well just so that my bronzer and everything will gone really seamlessly and everywhere is zapped next I'm just gonna do my eyebrows off camera just because you guys have seen me do it a million times but I will put my eyebrow tutorial down in the description box for you next I'm just gonna take a little bit of that buck color from that palette and just apply it onto the bottom lash line taking some more of that virgin shade that we applied on the lead and just take a small brush and apply it on the inner corner to open up our eyes and then I'm just taking a nude pencil and just applying it to our waterline this will just make our eyes appear a lot brighter and also open them up as well and then to finish off the eye look I'm just gonna be taking some mascara just to it really balance the top and the bottom lashes [Music] next I'm gonna start bronzing my skin I am using the Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light it's been a while since this bronzer has made an appearance but I definitely love this bronzer I stopped using it because I was running out and I didn't want to finish it so I blew it out again because I love using this kind of color for the winter time it's not totally yellow toned it does have a little bit more of that bez tone so it is nice up for the winter so I just prefer using this kind of color in the winter so just applied that all over the outer perimeter of my face and then taking hoola bronzer by benefit I'm just contouring the cheekbones just to give my face a little bit more definition I'm also using that same hoola to contour my nose a little bit as well [Music] for my blush today I'm gonna be taking Mac warm so and just applying a tiny little bit on my cheekbones just to give myself a little bit of color [Music] and then to highlight I'm gonna be using the laura geller gilded honey highlighter I absolutely love this and I'm just applying a fairly small amount nothing too much on the cheekbones and also on the tip of my nose and for the lips today for the star of the show this is definitely the main attraction of this look I'm gonna be using Matt chestnut pencil all over the lips now I wasn't sure what kind of brown I wanted to go if for this look but I definitely knew I wanted to go for a brown just because I have seen so many brown shades recently and I personally have never done this on my channel before and I've actually don't think I've ever worn this kind of color before so I just knew I had to do it at least once and I actually really loved it I think I'll be doing this color a lot more I just lined all of my lips with it and then also filled in although I did make sure to moisturize my lips before hands just because this can be very drying so guys that is the end of this makeup tutorial I hope that you enjoyed although it is something a little bit more simple it's definitely something I love you guys were requesting a more simple eyelet with a bold lip you can totally substitute the brown for any lip color you want I just really wanted to do something a little bit different I didn't want to do something typical like the dark purple I do sometimes and also red I wanted to change up a little bit and if you haven't tried brown I definitely recommend it because although I'm not a bold lip person I am loving this if you did enjoy this video then please give it a thumbs up because it does help me out a ton and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I put new videos up three times a week and follow me on all social media too i am on twitter facebook instagram and snapchat all under makeup by laila i hope you all have an amazing day i can't wait to see you guys in my next video and i will talk to you later bye guys [Music] [Music] poetry crazy world corners [Music] crazy reach downhi everyone so this tutorial is going to be how to recreate the look that Samina Gomez wore for her performance at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show you guys are always asking me if I will create some Selena Gomez makeup looks for you and I absolutely love the votes it the look that she wore for the fashion show it was a really warm bronzy smoky eye with glitter on it at least when the camera like pinned and on her it definitely looked like she had some chunky glitter going on so I definitely wanted to put that on the look too and she was wearing blue contacts which I think just kind of made her look a little bit different I'm wearing green contacts but because the both of us have really dark dark brown eyes I feel like the effect is still pretty similar even though hers were technically blue and wintergreen I think it still looks really similar and yeah so if you guys are interested in seeing how I recreated this look then please keep watching so I am starting off with eye primer I'm using lorac behind the scenes eyeshadow primer we're going to be priming our eyelids first because they're going to be working with glitter and you don't want that to fall onto your base taking this midtone pink called soulful from the egg cosmetics naturally pretty palette I'm working this into the crease of my eye with a fluffy blending brush this is going to be our transition shade it just gives a look a lot of overall warmth taking this gel liner from colour-pop in the shade sweet tooth I am taking my finger I'm just patting this onto my eyelids it is going to be a base for the next shadow that we use taking pokerface from makeup geek this is a pigment I picked this up on a flat shadow brush and patted this directly on top of sweet tooth and as you guys can see it just helps that pigment really stick and look even more metallic and Selena's shape of her shadow was a little bit catty so I am bringing this into the outer corner and it's not perfect but I'm giving it a little bit of sharpness on the edge like you guys can see I'm definitely giving it a caddy shape now for the glitter this is gorgeous Cosmetics glitter in the shade Oscar I picked this up directly on my fingertip with a little bit of duo eyelash glue and I just patted this directly onto my lid naina definitely had a little bit of chunky glitter going on and it looked so beautiful when it would flash in the lights and the camera was panned in closely to her eyes it just made her eyes sparkle it was so amazing to clean up fall out I took a Neutrogena makeup wipe and it picked up the glitter fine if you're having an extra hard time with the glitter that you are using then you can use some tape and that will just pick that up right off your face I'm priming my face with angel veil from NYX for my base I mix visa for illuminating drops in morning light with Dr Starr Foundation while I said that really good your star foundation and I applied this to my face with a flat top kabuki from hair and makeup addiction you taking Maybelline instant age rewind in the shades medium and newtralizer I am using my fingertips and I'm just applying this right under the eye to conceal and highlight and I put a little bit on the nose and keep it slow but I wanted to keep it overall true to the Victoria's Secret look because selena was definitely looking really natural and dewy so I wanted to keep the highlighting and contouring a little bit more light handed I set everything with the Kogan doe uh translucent light reflecting powder my fast she is I believe how you say it and I set the concealer foundation everything with this because like I said I didn't want the concealer to be too stark and highlighted and then I contoured my face just lightly with macchiato from Anastasia Beverly Hills contour where I typically do around the hairline under the cheekbones sides of the nose jawline you know the drill and to bronze my skin I'm taking the Lancome bronzer and just on a big fluffy brush this one is from Sedona lace I'm just lightly giving my face and overall more bronze appearance to fit the victoria secret super bronze look and then I took the poker face pigment from makeup geek once again on a luxe petit crease brush this one's from zoeva and I just smudge this into the lower lash line all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner and then I highlighted the face with champagne pop this is from Becca I picked this up on this tulip bulbs shaped brush from Sedona lace and like I said so you know wasn't super highlighted and contoured so I wanted this to just be really glowing from within eliminated looking so rather than really concentrating the highlight anywhere I worked it all over the whole face and then I was having a hard time my eyes were watering from the contacts but then I took this brown liner from Sigma in the shade balance and I work back into my waterline I'm going behind myself cool then I took the ICO fat liquid liner and I did thick dramatic wings because Selena had a very dramatic liquid cat eye going on I used Smashbox x-rated mascara on my top and bottom lashes I did do one coat of waterproof mascara but I'm doing the bulk of mascara with Smashbox x-rated this is sesame blush from gorgeous cosmetics I think this looks just like whatever saline I was wearing it's a very orange II terracotta warm blush so for lashes I used s kiddo desire I have one used so many times and I don't have the box anymore but I will link them down below if you guys they're very dramatic and she definitely had lots of lashes going on and then I just wiped my lip balm off with a makeup like to get started with a nice dry base and I am applying sore this is a Mac lip pencil and then just lightly outlining my lips for a little bit of definition or the color I am using hobbies like math for me I was running a light fleshie of kinky nude and I think this looks pretty similar to whatever she had going on her lips were very glossy and I used my favorite lip gloss of all time wedge Russian by buxom and then I finished everything off with a spray of Taco doing luminous skin miss my new absolute favorite that I've been talking to you guys about so much lately don't let me don't let me go don't let me go don't let me don't let me alright guys and this is the

tried to film this intro it's just been a hot mess so far I just kind of talk I can't get any of my words right but in today's video I have created this New Year's Eve inspired makeup tutorial it's really glamorous but at the same time I think it's super super wearable for New Year's Eve this is actually something that I can see myself walking out of the house wearing to go to like a New Year's Eve party or event or something like that it's not like a smokey eye that's really hard to recruit might end up making you look like you've been punched in the face it's actually really easy to recreate like the technique is just so simple and straightforward so yeah I really hope that you guys enjoy it I also wanted to say a massive thank you for a hundred thousand subscribers I can't believe it I woke up and I like needed to pinch myself a couple of times just to make sure that it was real because I was like in actual shock but I made it to 100,000 subscribers literally at the start of December I had 20,000 subscribers and now at the end of December I am a hundred thousand is so surreal to me like I never thought that I would get a hundred thousand subscribers so it's just crazy and I just want to say thank you guys so much for all your support and yeah if you guys are interested in how I achieve this look then please just keep on watching so I'm starting off with my eyebrows today and I'm using the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is in the shade evany and i've actually filmed an eyebrow to routine for you guys which will be up soon so I'm just gonna skip quickly through this and to set my hairs in place I'm using the Loreal brow artist plumper because obviously you don't want them to be moving throughout the neck just have them on for a while and then I'm taking some sticky tape and I'm going to tape this onto the back of my hand first just so it's not so harsh on my skin and then as I apply this I'm going to be lining it up with the line of my lower lash line on both eyes this way you can get the crisp line to be even on both sides of your eye now to prime and remove any discoloration from my eyes I'm going to be taking the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and applying this all over my eyelids with a Real Techniques crease buffing brush I believe it's cool and then I'm going to be setting all of that with my Rimmel London stay matte transparent powder to highlight the brow bone and the inner corner I'm using new makeup each shared White Lies you really don't have to highlight your inner corner at this point arm it kind of gets ruined anyway I have to go in and touch it up so there's really no point in this step now taking another makeup geek eyeshadow this is in the shade frappe and I'm just going to apply this all over the outer corner of the all over the outer V of the eye and then once I have less product on my brush I'm just going to feather it into the rest of the crease into the inner corner and now I'm going to deepen up the outer V of the eye using cocoa bear or so from makeup geek and I'm just going to be doing the exact same thing except I won't be taking it and feathering it into the inner corner like I did with frappe I'm just keeping it on the outer V only so I'm just going to lay out our shadows and deepen up that outer V now I'm taking these shades Swiss chocolate from Mac and just doing the same thing I'm just taking it all over that sticky tape and also a tiny bit on the crease of my eye just on the outer corner of the crease just deepening all of that up but not entirely covering cocoa bear and frappe and then I'm taking fudge from Anastasia Beverly Hills and I'm going to be taking the exact same steps and last but not least I'll be taking the makeup geek shade corrupt which is a black on a little pencil brush and I really wasn't happy with the pigmentation of this black so I don't know I just left it but if you guys wanted to darken it up even more you could just take a more pigmented black color or just keep building it up now I'm taking my Maybelline eye studio gel liner and just going to be applying a thin winged liner which is made so easy thanks to the sticky tape I did take this all the way over into the inner corner but I couldn't film it but I'm using one hand so I just had to duck off camera and now I'm just going to remove the sticky tape and clean off any excess product that fell off and then I'm going to be taking the shade half-baked from The Naked palette this comes in a single shadow by urban decay as well so you don't have to use the Naked palette at all I just don't have the single shadow also when you apply this it is going to get on the eyeliner so you will just have to touch that up a little bit on the eye and I also like to diffuse and blend out the half-baked shadow so that it's not like too sharp and then I'm going to be priming my face with the makeup forever step 1 equalizer the smoothing one I just feel like having a smooth flawless base to start off with on New Year's is just a really great idea and lately I have been loving to use a concealer to get rid of any discoloration and hide some freckles that I have on my face I like to do this before foundation so that I don't have to like layer on my foundation so much and make it look cakey just to hide the freckles so I just kind of cover them up a little bit with concealer and then blend it out with a damp Beauty Blender and then I'm going to correct the bags under my eyes as always with my Bobbi Brown corrector in the shade light peach and then for foundation I'm going to be taking a mixture of my bourgeois foundation and my NARS sheer glow foundation I don't remember the shades off the top of my head but I will list them in the description below I'm just going to apply this and blend it in with a density blender to highlight and conceal I'm taking my Rimmel London conceal and correct I think it's called something like that Russian I'm not really sure it'll be in the description bar and I'm just going to apply this in all the normal places my under eyes my nose my Cupid's bow and my chin and obviously as I always do blending it out with a damp Beauty Blender and using my Laura Mercier translucent powder to set all of that I found it didn't make it as bright as I wanted to though so I added a little bit of the banana shade from the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit on top which they sell separately on their website as well now I'm setting the rest of my face with my Rimmel London stay matte transparent powder and I'm just going to press this into the skin instead of like rubbing it on or anything because I don't want to move any of the foundation because I still want it to stay with the coverage I have I don't want to like move and then the coverage is gone and then my freckles show and then I'm applying some bronzer this is the Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and I have been loving this recently I didn't like it at first I think it's because I used it as a contour shade and looked muddy but one of my favorites now and then I'm contouring with my hoola by benefit bronzer on my favorite contouring brush at the moment I've been loving this it's actually a highlight brush from zoeva but it just gets right into those cheekbones it is so good for blush I'm taking smitten from makeup Y which is my favorite grup favorite blush just on an angled cheek finish brush from zoeva and then I'm going to highlight using colourpop's lunch money highlighter on a morphe m51 brush which is obviously my favorite highlight brush of all time because I use it in every single video so now I'm just going to finish off the eyes and I take the shade Coco bear from makeup geek and I start applying this and then I'm like no I want to make it a little bit more dramatic so I take the black eyeliner pencil from Maybelline the color shows I pencil something like that and I just apply that and then I go back in and smoke out my lower lash line with the shade Coco bear again and now I'm reapplying that inner corner highlight with the shade White Lies from makeup geek of course as I said I would and then just applying some scar this is the perversion scar from urban decay aka my favorite mascara in the entire world and I find this to both top and bottom lashes and now I'm taking some falsies these are the most dramatic falsies I have they are in the style goddess from Koko lashes and I just love them so much I feel like they just complete the look you know I'm on science and I want the eyes to be the main focus so I'm just going to be applying a nude lipstick today so I'm starting off by lining my lips with the well lip liner from math and then I'm going to go in with a MAC lipstick in the shade honey love which is the most amazing and nude lipstick ever I'm just obsessed and you could just leave it at this but I went in with the Anasazi Beverly Hills lip gloss in the shade under s and I didn't want it to overpower the color of the honey love lipstick so I only applied a little bit and then I kind of went over it with my finger to just diffuse the color a little bit that brings us to the end of today's tutorial

put up this look on Instagram yesterday and a load of you want to see a makeup tutorial I also tweeted if you guys want to see this look and those of you said yes so I'm I've just realized my stalkers and so I don't yes it is okay in fact what I was saying so many of you wanted makeup tutorials so I'm here doing a makeup story for you guys it's really like dole I can it's just just a look that I would totally go for a lot of it so I hope you guys enjoy the mini pop tutorial if you want to see this book thank you for watching okay so I've already moisturized my skin I used a clean dramatically different moisturizing cream for very dry to dry skin I'm gonna start off with my brows I could normally do I'm just gonna brush through them I'm gonna use my Mac eye brow pencil in spiked so I follow the natural shape I already have and then it's sort of just build from that shape so I don't really have an arch here but I just create one with what I do have and I always keep brushing through I'm gonna do an update your brow routine like a proper in-depth how I do my brows we okay and then I'm going to use my Alice's your Beverly Hills brow powder in Ebony I'm going to use the Anastasia Beverly Hills it's like a brow brush like suppose because it's quite fully and then it's got this angle fit and this is number 12 and I'm just gonna shade in where there's random gaps I prefer to do this with a powder because it makes it look more natural rub than like coloring it in with pencil I just find it just looks far better when I do this rather than doing it with a bull pencil okay and then I'm going to conceal my brows I conceal with the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer my shade is it's come up so I can't say what my shade is I think it was medium dark something like that and I normally use this but I'm a little bit more tan for this now so I mix it with the Make Up For Ever full cover concealer just for the color and actually you don't really try this on its own I probably should but I just mix these two together on the back of my hand this is just to clean up any areas it's a really good trick to do if you're like in the middle of I grow in your brows then doesn't look so ridiculous unless someone goes really close to your face but like then you could like be it why you so close I mean I feel good notice the hairs and you to close well the rest of the concealer that's on the back of my hand I like to go in these bits in my eyes just because I always do my eyes before I do my foundation and then when I do my foundation I could get to put em product here and then when I go to take like flash photos and stuff I can like see where I've missed it and it just gets ridiculous I'm going to prime eyelid with Emma decay primer potion as per usual I'm actually looking for a new primer and not fair not for any particular reason I like that prime um but I like to try new products and stuff apparently the NARS primer is really good but they can really get there I'm also going to prime my face with my Jacobs primer now I did a snapchat rant about this and saying how much I didn't really really like it I didn't see the high value and I did try for quite a few times and I just didn't like it but I ended up trying it again just because I just I like to give products a try I tried it again and like ah I really really liked it I personally think it has something to do with the weather change I didn't really particularly in summer and then while it was cooling down they were still good weather I didn't really like it now that it's winter my skin is a lot drier and I feel like this is like perfect for dry skin because before it made my skin really oily but it is working like a dream right now that is autumn or fall and you wanna call and see I kind of take back what I said I like to pry my face while I'm doing my eyes just to put it good and absorb and stuff and I like on to the eyes so I'm mainly going to be you I'm going to be using this palette and it's just a customized palette from Mac and I saw I just put these four in this particular about it um I'm gonna be using Omega and I'm gonna be using on a Mac - to avoid any one of these because it's just crusty right now this is going to be like a transition show so there's really not much color to it at all but it's just something that the other colors can blend into so this is just going to go in the crease there's really not much color to it at all and that's going to take my Mac 217 and I'm going to mix it mix these two colors together oh this one is blackberry and this one is expresso my brush is kind of dirty I used it in this color yesterday they're still gonna come out the same so blackberry an expresso mix them - to get on a 217 and go right in the crease with this I mix the blackberry color because this look is quite pinkish and so you don't want it to be like a solid round in the color you want going to be a theme tone some sort of purple or some sort of pink I feel like it complements the pink in the lids way for the lid I'm going to be using this Joey the brush it's just a flat brush you wanna have it as a flat brush because you want to Pat color on and I'm going to be using this color this is yogurt by Mac it is a matte pink color and then it blend the crease out again I thought only thing that the leaves were pink enough yesterday so I'm going to use my toothpaste acknowledge the age of line leave my Too Faced and chocolate bar palette I'm not sure what the color on bit about use is called but then use this pink here this pallets mind it's a little white as I'm going to call my eyelashes ask our amusement of what's your type mascara buy the farm this is the tall dark and handsome one I love this mascara a lot okay so I'm going to use some eyelashes I know she's I'm using are the Lily lashes mine are not in there because I use them yesterday but they look like yes they are fabulous these are in Monaco and I'm saying that right okay so you want to do this as close to the lash line as you possibly can do it because there's not going to be eyeliner so as close as possible I actually this makes me nervous because it just does okay here we go I always put them in the middle first and then I arranged the outer edge you leave them to dry no your foundation now I'm going to use any foundation that I have not used before let's start off by using my favorite foundation brush which is the joy everyone mentioned a couple times now and I'm going to be using the Born This Way two-faced foundation my shade is honey add notes about this foundation so I'm just going to - I don't know Modi why normally do and just do it around with face seems like a good color match so that's okay I kind of matched it myself sayo risky risky time okay I get I am the most nervous person when you come to try foundations new ones because I just hadn't got you home foundation brush to step up and listen you guys are the first to see me try this foundation it's quite exciting yeah just one there and it sounds quite good and I can break down my neck it's a good kind of match but I always do this anyway time for concealer I'm gonna use my Bobbi Brown corrector first in darky I'm gonna go on do my eyes with this one of my eyes I'm going to be using the amazing concealer then I'm using the amazing concealer in tan golden and blend it out a to set that way the reviews in my Laura Mercier translucent powder and another and on G thingy and let tap that underneath my own I like to do this as soon as I put concealer on because it avoids the crease iam and I get a lot of grease in do while that is baking I'm going to use my mac mineralize foundation in nw15 this is to contour arm using my body shop brush and this is a blusher brush and notice going around my forehead first I'm going to ask the rest of this power rock because I just look mental and I'm gonna use my contour brush by Real Techniques and I'm not pressing down hard so it's really like that really live streams if fly-in is driving me insane like the jet inside actually I'm going to go crazy finish off my eyes real quick before I finish up some phase I'm going to go back into these two colors that vary in expresso and go underneath my eyes losing the to seven teams codifies which is like my favorite brush and then did underneath the eyes I'm going to take my Mac

white and that white I've never used a map in a quarter before but I think I don't know it's really good and then mascara on the bottom lashes I'm going to use the same mascara by the bar on the tall dark and handsome one also going to use a nude eyeliner this is a mister right now eyeliner pencil by the balm this colours quick dry and I believe he's just going to grow more on this creates that dough like I finished off the face I'm going to take my labelled um brush I wash mine it sort of dried wrong which is why that's sticking out but that wasn't like that before it's just an angled fluffy brush basically I'm going to use my Bahama Mama bronzer by the balm this is I could cooltime bronzer which is why I like it for contour and a lot and I also like this brush because that angle just going to take it and okay highlight highlight JPS his favorite parts of life I'm going to take my Real Techniques buffing brush and I'm going to take my Mac luster drops which it should I know I

and I also tweeted if you guys watch tutorial so I like you just watch this makeup again because I really do like it but yeah thanks again for watching make sure you subscribe like share this video you have no idea how much it helps me and yeah I'll see you next videohi guys welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be a lip swatch and our review on the new colour-pop ultra matte lipsticks I'm so excited to be doing this video just because I picked these up probably about two to three weeks ago I did place one order in for four of them and then I went back to get three more just because I fell in love with them so these are what they look like I did get a variety I just dropped one did get a variety of like nudes and darks like that's all that I wear so these are the ones that I got I only have seven not a lot but I did get these with my own money I did want to share them with you guys just because I feel like they're gorgeous and you guys need to pick them up before I do get into the lip swatch of it I do want to go ahead and do like a review of these so these are only six dollars on the colour-pop website which is I think is a steal because liquid lipsticks these days range from like 14 to like 20 dollars so they're pretty expensive for just one of them before you can get like four of them for the price of one liquid lipstick from like Kat Von D Anasazi these are super super affordable and the quality of them is absolutely amazing the only other liquid lipstick I've ever tried is from Gerard cosmetics but I love the color pop once more just because they're cheaper and the formula is probably the same but better they last all day they don't crack on my lips and they have a variety of so much different colors I haven't tried anasazi au or Kat Von D or anything like that I feel like I don't need to because these were so affordable and the color range is amazing they have from nudes to pinks to Purple's to blues to a green one and from like vampy fall colors obviously from these that I have um yeah I just feel like they're super amazing they're so affordable you guys can just like get two of them try Mel and then go back and get as much as you want and the quality of them is absolutely amazing I they tend to be very drying but that's only cuz through the old trim mat so it's not going to exfoliate and moisturize before you put these on you're going to be good to go there's no problem I just think liquid lipsticks are like the best invention just because I like matte lips and I don't like anything that's gonna rub off throughout the day and these definitely don't rub off I kiss anything and nothing comes off like I'm rubbing it and nothing is coming off like these things are absolutely amazing like I said they're so long-lasting the color range is like out of this world I just think that you guys need to go get these out try them out there's nothing that you can lose of in like six bucks if you don't like it like they're so affordable they're long wearing I just think so much worth the money I just feel like they should be more than six dollars but they're not I'm glad for that but yeah I think I'm done rambling I really do like them and I recommend them to you guys I'm gonna have the link down below to the website so you guys can go and check them out but other than that let me fix my hair and then that I'm gonna go ahead and get into the lip swatches hope you guys enjoy this video I hope that you guys going buy them because they're super amazing I love them I can't wait to wear these dark colors for fall I love them but yeah you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in my next video Ohhey guys so today's video is going to be on this make a tutorial it's like a 2p silvery cool tone look out of my comfort zone a little bit but I think it's so pretty it's also really suitable for prom I feel like if you're wearing a topi dress or like a purple dress this would look really pretty I like it so much and I hope you do too if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching my friends so I'm going to start out by priming my eyelids using Mac's painterly Paint Pots get rid of all those veins on my eyelids and to prime them of course I'm going to go into this Tarte tartlets palette right here and on this zoeva brush I'm going to dip it into the color free-spirit and basically what I'm doing is just kind of setting the base I put down so it's not sticky then I'm going to go back into the palette and I'm going to dip a fluffy blending brush into the shade natural beauty this is like a really light babi purpley gray color so it's perfect as a transition shade so that's what I'm using it for I'm just buffing this back and forth into my crease so that all the other eyeshadows that I put down on my lid blend nicely into the crease if that makes sense then with a more precise blending brushes from zoeva but it's just like a Mac 217 I'm going to dip it into the shade best friend this one is a lot more purple it's basically just like a mid-tone like matte purple color everything in this palette is matte by the way and so I'm just applying this to the outer V of my eye and it's bringing it into my crease I'm going to take this josie maran watercolor eyeshadow in the shade is out pink and i'm going to apply this to my lid using the little sponge tip applicator and then I'm going to blend it out with my finger it's like a really concentrated metallic pigment so I'm just taking my ring finger and just blending it out then for my favorite part I'm going to take this pigment from makeup geek in the shade nightlife it's a beautiful like to see like champagne with like a topi undertone no it's really gorgeous on the lid and I'm going to apply this all over my entire lid up to the crease to intensify that pigment a little bit more I'm going to take mac fix+ and I'm going to spray my brush with it and then dip it back into the pigment and this is just really really going to intensify the eyeshadow it's going to make it more metallic and bring out like the topi undertone a lot more and then I got out of the frame a little bit but basically I just put it in my on my entire lid you get the gist going back into that tartlet palette I'm going to zip it right back into best friend and I'm gonna apply this right into the crease and I'm using a very very precise like pointy blending brush it's kind of like a pencil brush and I really want a lot of the purple to be concentrated into the crease so that's why I'm using a pencil brush I'm just taking my time going back and forth and yeah after I do that I'm just going to blend everything out so there are no harsh lines so I'm taking that fluffy blending brush again Sigma e-40 and I'm going to dip it right back into natural beauty and then I'm just going to buff everything out into my crease I wanted some more purple in my crease but I didn't want it to look harsh I'm not I didn't to a cook crease or anything I just want everything to look nice and diffused and blown out then I'm going to take this shade called supermom and this is gonna be my highlight it's like a very like a light light light peachy pinky kind of color and it makes it a really nice matte highlight under the brow bone and I'm gonna take this Milani eye tech perfection liquid liner in black and I'm gonna start doing my wing the way that I really like to do it is I apply a super super thin layer as close to my lashes as possible and then I make it figure as I go so I just make the base really really thin and then just start you know making the way.you thicker but then I get out of the frame as per usual and that went across I'm gonna take this NYX gel liner in black the new like tres Jolie ones they are my favorite black eyeliner from the drugstore as of right now and I love them so I'm just going to tightline with it and then I'm just going to go ahead off-camera and apply my Ardell with these I'm gonna finish off I'm gonna start my face before finish off my eyes I'm priming my face using a makeup forever HD primer and then I'm going to go in with the Bourjois healthy mix serum foundation usually I would go for like a more full coverage Foundation especially for prom but my skin was acting super sensitive and I wanted something that was like light weight on my face like I wanted my foundation to be a little bit more lightweight so that's why I'm using my favorite which is the Bourjois healthy mix serum I'm in the shade 52 so I'm just applying that all over my face using a real techniques buffing brush and then with a real techniques like powder brush I'm going to go into the bourgeois healthy balance powder and I'm just going to powder my face a little bit staying away from my under-eye area specifically because I'm going to go in with concealer next and I'm using it the Maybelline master conceal by face studio and on a Real Techniques contour brush I'm applying that underneath my eyes and then I'm just going to blend it up something weird lends it out blend it out yeah so I'm just blending that up I also puts them on the bridge of my nose and on other parts of my face to highlight with the concealer I'm going to be setting that with Mac emphasized powder this is a really nice brightening powder and it's good to set your under eyes if you want like a bright under-eye effect which I do especially for nighttime or going out I love the under eye to be nice and bright now I'm going to go ahead and finish off the eyes I'm taking a sigma pencil brush and I'm going to dip it into natural beauty and I'm going to start smudging that on my lower lashes by the way I filmed this tutorial literally at 3 o'clock in the morning so that is why my eyes are so red I was dead tired but I really wanted to get this video for you guys cuz you know I didn't have a video up on Wednesday and I just wanted a video up but anyway I did that same pencil brush into the shade a best friend and I'm smoking it out even more then after that I'm going to add some of that same eyeliner from NYX to my waterline just to make it nice and deep on the lower lash line then I'm gonna take the super dark purple in this palette and it's called bombshell and I'm gonna really smoke it out again with that same pencil brush and then I just applied some mascara and then I am done with the eyes so moving on to the face I am taking my girl lactic bronzer in the shade Cobo this is my favorite bronzer of all time and I'm using the Real Techniques multi-tasking brush to just run up my face for some reason my bronzer was kind of washed out on camera but like I had like an intense bronzing contour action you just couldn't really tell that much yes so I'm just contouring kind of and bronzing at the same time for blush I'm using this Tarte one called celebrated it's like one of their new blushes and it is beautiful I love it it's a very very soft pink I'm not crazy for blush like a nun intense lush look so this soft pink is so perfect with so many looks and then I'm going to highlight my face using the Physicians Formula if I could open it up there you go shimmer strip in Miami strip my favorite highlighter of all-time drugstore high-end it's my favorite and I'm just highlighting with I believe this is zoeva like tapered highlighter brush and the brush I used to apply my blush was a Mac one like the Mac blush brush but yeah then I'm going to go ahead and finish off this look by doing a little lip combo here and my little lip liner broke a little bit this is a a colour-pop lippie pencil in the shade skimpy and I'm just applying that to my entire lip but then I thought it was way too warm for this look so I'm going in with this NYX high voltage lipstick in the shade stone it's such a cool unique like beautiful nude because it has a lot of great it I don't know it's really really pretty but yeah that completes this makeup look thank you guys so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video byehello cookies it's Siri I'm back and today I'm going to show you this Karrueche Tran inspired makeup look and the thing is it's people on instagram who told me that I looked like her and I was like really okay well she's so super beautiful and I've never ever thought that I looked like her so it's like well I might do a makeup look inspired by one of her photos just for fun and this is what I came up with first I'm applying my next photo loving primer all over my face then Mike and c42 foundation that I'm dabbing all over the face again onto the light concealer I'm applying it as I usually do and I'll put a link somewhere here guys if you want to see my usual highlight contour when I go for full highlighting and contouring up to the dark part of the concealer basically I'm doing it differently so I'm making my nose much bigger and I'm ending it under the eyebrows which I usually never do and then on the forehead I'm doing this line up here that I usually don't do a verbal I'm just trying to more or less match the facial structure she has on that photo a little bit of powder of course to set everything in place and then I'm doing the eyebrows so for the eyebrows I just watched her tutorial and I'm following the way she does it so I'm just feeling under the eyebrow first and here I'm actually doing a longer brow because she's doing her brows much longer than I usually do so I'm just dragging it a little bit more like so and then I'm just basically filling the eyebrows in here I'm starting to frown not because I'm pissed but more because I see that she also has much sharper eyebrows so by frowning I can see where it should be sharper on top there this is a step that I usually never do but I can see on the food that she has some foundation or concealer going on under her brow and over the eyebrow to highlight it and make it more clean I guess so that's what I'm doing now I'm just taking some foundation and a concealer brush from Ferris cosmetics and yes within my edges lumineer shadow primer that I'm applying all over my lids BH Cosmetics eyes on the 80s palette and I'm taking this warm brown color that I'm applying on the crease next I'm taking this champagne cutter that I'm applying as a highlight under my eyebrow now I'm taking black heart from my Naked 3 palette and I'm just dabbing it all over my eyelid then I'm curling my eyelashes with this torture device Maddy Ostrow favorite mascara of course darks one of them mark lashes that are perfect because they're slightly longer at the edges Casa Vega products had a primer on the tip of my nose and then this is something that I usually don't do it on the chin and on the forehead but I can see that on the photo she has some glow going on on these areas as well so that's what I'm trying to reproduce and then of course on my cheekbones which I kind of always do the highlighter itself Adam Devine on the forehead on the tip of my nose on my chin on my cheekbones basically everywhere will have the primer onto the lips I'm just grabbing some random warm brown lip liner and I'm lining my lower lip the same as I would usually do so just physically lighting it with the brown liner and then my upper lip I'm trying to make it much smaller so I'm lining inside my natural lip shape because I can see on the photo that she has a smaller smaller upper lip and a bigger lower lip and then has a beauty nude with a hybrid lipstick that I really love along dressed up in everywhere and as you can see I drew lines with the brown lip liner on my bottom lip to accentuate the effect of a bigger bottom lip compared to the smaller upper lip I'm just using some regular powder as a bronzer because I don't think I own any bronzer really and if I were to bronze I'd rather have a matte one and I never bronze but I can see as well on the photo that she's using a bronzer so I'm just taking a darker powder that is Matt Andres bronson everywhere and this is basically the final look I usually never pose in my videos because I'm not really good at that so bear with me but I'm doing it this time because I really want you guys to see how the makeup looks like and yeah that's about it I hope you liked it thank you so much for watching I hope you

contour look a little bit more defined what you do is you just put translucent powder where you just highlighted your face and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes I'm going to take this Mac bronzer and a shade harmony with a fan brush and just find the hollows of my cheek bones and contour then I'm going to contour my nose my temples under my lips to make them look a little powdery then anywhere else that creates natural shadows on my face then I'm going to blend out the translucent powder with a fluffy NYX brush now onto my eyes I'm going to be using the buxom eyeshadow palette and a fluffy it cosmetics brush I'm going to be using the gold color and I'm going to be applying it onto my eyelid then with the same fluffy brush I'm going to take the brown color next to the gold and put it into my crease in my eye and blend it out after that I'm going to take the lightest almost white highlight color and put it right underneath my brow bone now I'm going to highlight my cheekbones I'm going to take a bigger fan brush from NYX Cosmetics and a highlighter from Mac called soft and gentle I'm going to apply it right above my contour then I'm going to smoke up my eyes a little bit more this is actually an eyebrow palette from ardell but I'm using it as a smoked out eyeliner I'm using this eyebrow brush from NYX I'm going to take the darkest brown shade and apply it under my lower lash line and smoke it out and then I'm going to do the same thing on my upper lash line now with that same brush I'm going to brush my eyebrows upward then use my Anastacio brow gel and soft brown I naturally have really dark eyebrows so I'm just going to follow the shape of my brow and just fill them in a little bit now onto lashes I'm going to be using the Maybelline falsies push-up drama mascara I'm just going to apply a few coats onto my lashes then I'm going to apply a few layers to my bottom lashes as well Oh Oh and lastly I'm going to move on to my lips I'm going to be using this pallid IO herbal lip liner and the shade naked then over line my lips just a little bit for a fuller look I'm going to take the lip liner and use it almost as a lipstick and fill in my lips a little bit I'm going to take my highlighter out again and apply a little bit to the center of my lips so my lips look a little bit powdery err that is the end of my daily makeup routine I hope you guys enjoy it if you did please give this video a like and subscribe to my channel I post videos every Monday for hashtag majestic Mondays and please check out my social media everything will be in the description box below I love you all so so so much and stay majestichi everyone welcome back to daily mix today we're going back to basics tons of you have requested to know how to use makeup brushes we are going to run you through the best ones and what they do okay guys so I'm going to kick us off with foundation brushes there are so many to choose from and people like which one do I need everyone does a little bit of a different job I'm going to start off with this one which is a buffing brush now a buffing brush is beautiful with most foundations pretty much all foundations and it will really buff a product into the skin so it will give you a very airbrushed finish it's not too much coverage as well but you can build with this brush next I'm going to introduce you to the stippling brush the stippling brush will give you a much lighter coverage it is great if you use a foundation that has light reflecting pigments in because the more you buff it into the skin the more it shows them it's also duo-fiber so it picks up the product here and then as you buff it into the skin the black hairs buff it in a little bit more so they make it more airbrushed onto the skin and these ones all cruelty free synthetic brushes lastly the foundation the one that first we first saw when the foundation brushes came on the market is the normal foundation brush a flat foundation brush they come in different sizes and this one will give you a little bit more coverage next let's talk about concealer I've got two here that I really like and I use them in different areas on the face this one is actually an eyeshadow brush it's called a deluxe crease brush and really you use it through the crease of your eye but because it goes into the orbital bone it also goes under so all the way around so I use this as a concealer brush just underneath the eyes and it fits perfectly this one is a Trish McEvoy brush and I use this when I need more coverage somewhere so say I have red cheeks and I want to put a bit of concealer there I'll use this or just on the forehead or on the chin little bit like a mini foundation exactly yeah I love that one then if you have a tiny blemish to cover then you might want something like this this one is a detailer brush it's a tiny little brush that you can also use in other places on the face I often use it as a lip brush I also use it for blending eyeshadow just along the lash line but it's brilliant for concealer because you can see it's just tapered there so if you have a little blemish you wanna cover that's the one to go for okay so here two of my favorite eyeshadow brushes this is the two one seven for Mac 239 from Mac I use them in every single video they're absolutely brilliant this one I use for packing on products so when I want a dark smoky eye I'm going to use this brush to push it on is short shorter than this one so it's going to pick up a lot more product it's also going to drop a less a lot less product than this one so put it on with this one blend with this one this one you can see it's more splayed out it's longer its fluffier it's gonna blend really well then you have eyeshadow brushes it's slightly more precise it's slightly smaller you've got this is a Mac two one nine and it's basically I love it for getting right under the eyes and buffing in eyeshadow also if you want a little bit of highlighter just in the corner of the eye also use this through my brow bone if I want to conceal really nice brush you have an angle brush now I use this for my eyebrows so I can get a really nice precise shape for my brows also use it for liner so those of you that aren't amazing at doing eyeliner this is a great brush for you because you can use it to guide where you want your eye liner to start so from the lower from your what's this called what did i from your waterline going crazy you can use it from your waterline to plot out where you want your eyeliner to start and then drag it and you can even do pushing motions if you not that comfortable with it I suppose for those that are a little bit more confident with their liner and you've got these kind of fine eyeliner brushes so these you would use in one sweeping motion across the lid next we have a powder brush now we want to powder our foundation into place to make sure that it's going to stay all day there's a few different types of powder brush you can choose from I've got a multitask brush it's not too big I don't want a powder brush that is massive so I'll just buff this all over the face and it'll give me a nice even coverage of powder loose or pressed you've then got an a duo fiber face brush this one's lovely as well because it picks up much less product so if you just want a minimal amount of powered-up just where you shine use this one just over those T's in areas work perfectly you can also use the brush that's slightly smaller this one is actually the contour brush and I like it for getting right into the areas that you just want to powder under the eyes even popping a coat of powder over your eyelids as well so that's perfect I think you have to think about the order that you do your makeup in some people like to put their foundation on and then they like to set their foundation there and then if you are one of those people then you're going to want quite a big powder brush if you're the kind of person like me that does your foundation then your entire makeup then finishes with powder then you're going to want a smaller brush that you can work around the areas so you're not messing up the work you've done okay guys so now you know how to use your brushes let us tell you how to clean them once you have used them because it's really important to clean them how often to clean your brushes have my personal brushes oh probably once a week yeah and the same well actually I clean them every time I change my makeup look so it depends what I'm doing but I think once a week is fine sometimes I don't even do it that often sometimes it I'll leave it like twelve days or something before doing it and really important when cleaning your brushes get yourself a good brush clean that there's loads available now some have oil in as well so this one doesn't actually some have oil in as well so it takes longer for your brushes to clean afterwards so do be careful which ones you get you go for but the oil is great if you want to rule that are a clean some people use just neat alcohol I'm not a massive fan of that because I actually think that over time it dries the bristles out and then the bristles on your brushes break so I wouldn't recommend that so the quickest easiest way to clean your brushes is to spot clean them that's when you take a little bit of your brush cleaner and you pour it on to a cloth then you're going to take your brush and you are just going to move it in circular motions around on the cloth now I actually really favored this method because it does mean that the ferrule never gets wet which means your brushes are going to last and last and last so once you have cleaned your brushes last thing you want to do is to stand it upright because all the brush cleaner that's in there is going to sink through and it's going to wear away the glue that holds all the brush together so make sure you lay it down and another thing that you can do especially if your makeup art is a great thing that we tend to do is once every few months because our brush is a massive massive clean maybe once a month actually and I tend to use a really soft baby shampoo and what do you use generally is very liquid you want something that's antibacterial that's the key ingredient there and give them a real deep clean and then leave them to stand as long as you don't need them for the next few days because they will stay wet for a while again make sure you're not wetting this bit okay people always do that don't they when they do a deep clean they put it in a big bowl of water and it goes you know water all the way up there you only really want to do the bristles yeah and that's really clean obviously makeup artist if you use your brushes on anyone they have to be clean straight afterwards before you use them on anyone else so I hope you found that interesting and maybe you've picked up some new ways of using your brushes if you have different ways that you use your brushes as well that we haven't mentioned pop them in the comments so everyone else can learn from you as well don't get subscribes you don't miss any other brilliant videos on this channel and we'll see you next time take care bye well I might need to use your brush to blend is my side a bit okay so yeah swaps can I have concealers your sister yeah what you want and w-30 NC 20 mix yeah now I'm not saying you're gonna look better because you just closed me you always look so lovely anyway you are naturally beautiful[Music] my first step to achieve glow dopes skin is the makeup primer spray from Scandinavia and this is just a vitamin based primer I also put it on my lips to moisturize them after I've applied my primer I'm applying my foundation this is the invisibly foundation in shade 300 which is solely designed for yellow olive skin tones and now I'm just taking my Stila contour duo palette kit whatever you wanna call it I'm just contouring my cheeks I just take my brush and do round strokes on my cheekbone to just define them and also I'm going to be doing a few dots on my forehead just to minimize the size of my alien five head and then after I've done that I'm just going to take two lines and draw them straight down the sides of my nose to slim my nose a little bit and now we're just going to blend it out blending is so important when it comes to contouring you don't want to have like dots or lines or anything leaving you looking like a Neapolitan ice cream so now we're going to take the highlight from the contour kit and just apply it underneath our eyes I'm using this one as a concealer because it's more lightweight than any other concealer I've had and then as well I just take it down the bridge of my nose now I'm taking the Kevyn Aucoin contour kit and I'm just setting all my contour my cream contouring stone or just setting it so stay for the whole day and I'm basically just doing the same thing but it's just with the powder what I like about the primer so much is that it's so lightweight and silicone free so doesn't it feel like I'm putting makeup on top of makeup it literally feels like I'm putting makeup on top of like the baby's butt skin like it's just so smooth and it keeps my makeup on for a very long time a lot of my primers have been very greasy and I guess it's from the silicone and it kind of like runs off my face but with this primer I've noticed that it stays on for almost like I think like 12 to 14 hours I would say it would stay on for that long if you use the primer and the finishing spray so it really does help a lot especially with my redness and then also with my pores it minimizes as well so I highly suggest you guys this primer if you're looking for a nice slick on free lightweight primer so once you have contoured with the powder just go ahead and blend this all the way out you don't want any lines or anything showing that even contouring [Music] now I'm just going to warming up my face I look a little dry a little gray so I'm taking this contour or bronzer palette from the beauty supply store and just applying it on my cheeks on my forehead and anywhere I feel like it's kind of pale [Music] [Music] you [Music] and now I'm taking this NARS blush and g-spot and I'm just dotting it on my cheeks to give me kind of like a cuter more innocent look I don't know I just love blushes and this blush is like the perfect blush with my complexion so I'm just applying it onto my cheeks and I'm going to take my Beauty Blender and blend it all out [Music] [Music] so I've always had a problem with having like ashy eyebrows so I'm taking the Scandinavian makeup primer spray I'm just spraying on a brush and I'm gonna like kind of like take the excess makeup off of my eyeball so they don't look kind of ashy after I fill them in and stuff after I have kind of taken away the ash I am using Anastasia Beverly Hills eyebrow pencil and just filling in my eyebrows ever so slightly and after I filled them in I take the interstage Beverly Hills brow gel and just kind of comb them into place [Music] once I finished my eyebrows I'm taking Nyx's lipliner and coffee and I'm just lining my lips this is my favorite lipliner I've been using it for months and months and months and I just find it very like a natural Brown so after I've lined my lips I'm just going to take it like smear it all over my lip so I can get like a full color and after I've used coffee I use Nyx's ever and just apply it in the center of my lips and now I'm just going to get to highlighting this is benefits high-beam and I just take this one and I blend it out with my Beauty Blender this is just like the base for my highlight it's a very liquidy highlighter so I wouldn't recommend using it on its own unless you like very very very dewy looking skin but this is just my initial highlighter and once I have blended out the high-beam highlighter I'm going to take Becca's champagne pop every girl on the planet should own this highlighter it's amazing and I'm just gonna put it on to my cheekbones just to kind of set that previous highlighter and stone and also just like up the ante for my highlighter like this is some crazy highlighting going on right now I know I'm saying so crazy now I'm sure a lot of you girls who do makeup know that spraying your brushes with a primer or water will obviously heighten the pigment of the highlighter or any eyeshadow or anything so I just sprayed the Scandanavia primer spray onto a brush and I'm using it now to kind of highlight those key points which are my corners of my eyes my brow bone tip of my nose and the bridge of my nose so now I'm just using up my wet brush and applying the highlighter also make sure to highlight your Cupid's bow and the top part of your lip this just accentuates the shape of your lip I guess for me it just makes everything look so glowy and beautiful so I will just do it now blend it out because you don't want it to look too like bam bam bam you want it to be like a subtle BAM so just blend it out and now I'm just going to wing my eyeliner what kind of like a opposite of a wing it's like a downwards winged eyeliner it's like a depressed eyeliner so just go ahead and angle it downwards this helps with making my eyes look bigger I've noticed so this is good for people who might have small eyes like myself [Music] [Music] once I finished lining my eyes I'm taking my go-to lashes the ardell demi wispies and I'm just applying them I've tried millions of lashes like I love lashes and these are the best lashes that I've ever used so if you're looking for a go-to lash I would do the ardell demi whispies and know this is not a promotion for them I'm just being honest now I'm just taking a black mascara and I'm just applying it to my natural lashes just so it blends with the false lashes and now I'm just going to set my face with the Scandinavian makeup setting spray and this is just going to keep it in place for the whole day I also apply to a q-tip and then I take my q-tip the wet q-tip and take the Becca highlighter and apply it underneath my eyes to make my eyes look more innocent looking it's like a Korean makeup tip that I picked up so I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I will list all the products below now these are just some scenes of me feeling myself and being conceited and fixing my hair you guys know the usual but I hope you guys kind of got the gist of it this is how I do my makeup everyday I love very glowy makeup so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll be back soon with another video for you guys love you so much thank you for watchinghi everyone so I'm back with a best school makeup tutorial I know it's only like the mentor of August but everyone goes back to school the beginning of September so I just get this video up and get it ready so you guys can pay yourself or going back to school see you home think in the head si si so I said I blabbering on I'm just gonna get them with a tutorial and yeah I hope you guys like it it's already boys drive must commence cleaning dramatically different moisturizing cream this particular one is for very dryer to dry combination skin I love this moisturizer is amazing for moisturizing and I will continue to purchase this forever I've also used this body shop bitter mini ice cream underneath my eyes I find that when I use this and I put concealer on my casino comes out better and I've got a lot of priests in going on under my eyes for a 20 year old I think is ridiculous I have a lot of crease underneath my eyes so I need i green definitely I've also sprayed my face with the Mac prep and prime it fix plus because it's just needed before after during makeup always ever and I've used this a forever ello lips lip balm okay so I'm going to start with brows as per usual I'm going to be using my normal Mac eyebrow pencil in that spiked I'm looking over here because of my mirrors over here obviously its school we don't want to go too harsh with eyebrows because I know what I think of school makeup I just think of it being a fairly light and not much to it but you still made a bit of effort so I'm basically just following my natural eyebrow shape and might create an art whether it is meant to be an arch for my eyebrow justice or it's not to grow you want when you're doing your eyebrows you want to keep brushing it with one of these brushes because then it makes the eyebrow much softer when I get to the front I like to go in the direction of the hairs that are going up so I like to use my eyebrow and so and go up if they're fairly natural I think I think the special that I've ended up so with my eyebrows I like to use concealer under my eyebrows because I just think it looks a lot neater the Urban Decay concealer this is a bit lighter than my skin tone right now but what's woodlands doing this stuff will be fine use my concealer brush by sheer cover I've never fired better a concealer brush then this one I could use in a few years and I blend it with my Real Techniques deluxe crease brush mainly going to be putting it towards the end and then just blending it out I asked you to do my eyebrows there's a few hairs so that you guys can see and buy again and just make neater this is an amazing trick if you're trying to grow your eyebrows out then cause you know the knee because it looks like dry rather than you when they've got you also we can see that I like to go in this area because I just always want up at foundational I always seem to forget to put it there and then it way I take pictures it's just like this like just actual where foundations drop so I like to put it there and then dab it with my view blender so normally I would then move on to eyes but for school I just thought as shouldn't really be much going on with the eyes I would just use a bit of a scale wrap maybe I line up but right now I've got eyelash extensions in and my friend Regina says them I will put her Instagram somewhere somewhere so we're here and I also encouraged to band below so I'm loving these right now like I can literally wake up in the morning and just like I really need makeup right out I'm going to move on to foundation I'm going to be using the NARS sheer glow this isn't a sudra cause there's probably is going to be a bit too light for me but I'll darken up I white to use Narsha glow because it's it's buildable but it can be as sheer as you want a nice the school it's like no makeup makeup so you want to look done but you don't want look overly done so I think Nasia Belle is a really good foundation for that because it's like perfect they're looking quite natural but also having that bit of coverage I also am a fan of the do I look so I like this foundation on line I've got put primer on but usually I would use a primer especially for days like school because especially if I was going to school just because like you're at school for like eight hours and you won't really have time to like touch up and stuff so I would use the benefit Porefessional futile day - I'll use the Porefessional primer but I've forgotten about that so I'm just going to carry on just going to get my Beauty Blender and go over the just make yourself Linda bindi and then I'm going to use concealer I'm just going to use the same urban decay concealer put it underneath my eyes to avoid the creasing that I was on about I'm going to say it with my Laura Mercier translucent powder I'm not going to bake or anything like that I'm just going to dust it want to do that as soon as you cut your if you're prone to crease in you want to do that as soon as you put the concealer on I'm using the RO Techniques contour brush to put underneath my eyes I'm just going to write just fit revaruraa minutes remaining okay I'm going to quickly dust this Mac bronzing powder this is matte bronze I'm going to use the cheat brush by Real Techniques and just just dust it about anywhere really there's no particular place there's no like real contouring it's just one tool of the face a little bit it I think that highlining highlighting is a fairly important in this look because I think highlight in looks natural ish I can make a huge difference to what your makeup looks like so I'm going to use this all over blow by Topshop this is a liquid illuminator I'm going to use this on my cheekbones I'm just going to put on a cheap eyes but now I'm going to use this buffing brush by Real Techniques and I'm gonna start blending and then as I'm blending I sort of just like randomly whatever was there put it in other places I don't know if the camera picks this up but it does work lovely forehead I'm just gonna get my Uganda and we'll just blend it out a bit cuz it my forehead so dehydrated it just is so rubbish with makeup products it just doesn't seem to blend of stuff so I've used that and then I'm going to use a fan brush and use my mary-lou manizer by the balm go fi fan brush and put on my cheekbones just got my nose I'm also gonna take this is what I don't know what this is it's just a random that little brush put it in the inner corners of my eyes brow bone thank you good bye once I've put that on I like to spray on my face with but Mac prep and prime fix plus again because because that highlighter powder once you spray this it tends to turn into I don't know how to explain it it just doesn't look like powder anymore it doesn't look dusty it just looks glowing so maybe that's set and then it starts to start eternal glowing is that a powdery you can if you want use a bit of blush are I'm going to use this color pop blush up this is called prenup and this is a satin blusher I'm going to use my duo fiber brush by Real Techniques and just just a little bit this gizmo cheese little bit of color a director's pick it up is this okay to finish the lips I'm going to use this color pop lippy stick this is in the color brick this is a matte color and then just for the sim and they're like to spread it around my finger just so it looks more natural and if you want I love lip glosses so I'm going to use this Charlotte Tilbury lip gloss in seduction just in the center and that is literally it for my makeup I don't think I was too much to it I don't think it was too hard I hope that you guys learn something from it I think it looks like natural this is as natural as I would go so this is just my take on natural ish makeup also if I was going back to school I would wear my hair like this I think it looks really good it I'm gonna put cake in my hair up and increase slow for my chunky if you haven't subscribe subscribe already like share favorite do it everyone comment just be nice so I'll see you guys in my next video love youokay so to start off with I'm going to be moisturizing my face and then the one that I have been loving it's kind of expensive for this little jar but this is the Clinique Moisture Surge intense and then this stuff is so bomb I've been using this for like I don't know like I got a little tester from Sephora and I fell in love and I was like dude this is so bomb so even if you're oily I always suggest to moisturize your face because it just it makes your foundation look that much more nice and unlike not so much a dewy but just so much more fresh and healthy looking all right so now that you're all moisturized you kind of want to let that sit in what I do and then I go ahead and put on my primer the one that I keep using it's really inexpensive and it's so so balm is the Rimmel stay matte primer and it looks like this and this one is um I think it's like less than ten dollars and you can get this at Ulta so also if you buy like over ten dollars out Ulta you can use like a 350 coupon and then you save three dollars and fifty cents so then now I'm just putting on the primer and this is really really good I feel like I do stay pretty mad but it's not like super matte or like I start to like look dry and flaky I don't know if you guys can hear it this song has been my shit it's on it's called Kanye by the chainsmokers so bomb and for my pores because I feel like my pores are like super visible I like to use the Porefessional primer from benefit and I got this one this is like a little travel size I think and it's actually really really really good and it lasts for like a really long time this one I usually just put on my t-zone on my nose and rub it in and I also really like this one because it doesn't feel as drying because I have the Smashbox one the purple one this one is for your pores as well to just minimize them and I feel like that one's a little drying so I really like this one because this one I feel like it gives me a bit of moisture as well you guys already know my favorite foundation this one a lot of people ask me what color I'm in I put that shit in the description box guys like no pens but check that shit and I am in the shade 106 Sun beige and I think this is like my second tube I've gone through so I like to put this one on as well as um the Maybelline fit me foundation and then this one looks like that this is the dewy one I think yeah because the other one's a matte and poreless this one is in the shade 230 just in case anyone's wondering because I feel like this one is really really mad and I don't want to look so mad anymore I kind of got over that I kind of want to have like a luminous look to my skin there was this person who made me laugh so bad they commented on that one makeup video I think says something about my ears how like I like the video was cool or whatever but like when they looked at my ears like they cringed and I was I don't know it's just funny I think that word is hella funny I already damped dampen my um Beauty blender or makeup sponge whatever the fuck is called oh my god I need to stop cussing - I really don't like it anymore like I've been obsessed with saying like bad words lately I think it's like really fun it like really brings out my emotion and I can be like fuck or like dig but yeah this is the real techniques like everyone knows what this one looks like and I actually really like this one it does when you let it dry um it does kind of like start crumbling off little pieces I don't know why it does that and um oh I like this song and then um I noticed that when I want to like wash it - use it again the next day it's just that's the only con that I have about it but it's really really bomb and I people what am i work like I suggest it and like I'm just like sorry like I really like to tell people like very like really really bomb makeup products that are inexpensive and I feel a little bad because like the sales and stuff at work but like dude is like I want you guys to save money I want you guys to have bomb shit still look fleek but save your money like who doesn't want that now you look like ass fuck with your flawless s skin I'm going to be using the Mac Pro Longwear concealer I usually use the Maybelline one which is so BAE like this one is I don't know I love finding inexpensive products that are really bomb and I'm gonna take that same makeup sponge I want to cut it call it a Beauty Blender but I feel like some people like really take that up the ass and they're like the little beauty blender because I know that they're like 30 bucks or some bullshit like that this one works just fine big I'm gonna just blend it out look hella crazy and then um I think I also showed that I like semi baked in that one makeup video so I'm gonna go ahead and do that a gun I always do it because I realized that when I bake under my eyes it just it helps my under-eye area not to crease at all and then I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows off camera because I already have a tutorial or a video on that if you guys want another one I guess I can do another one since I do have a newer camera and then you guys will like see it more updated more um just better quality you know what I realized that I forgot to do I forgot to bronze my face and I forgot a highlight I was wondering I was like why am i done so early it's like barely he's barely 12:08 to like really I'm almost done with my makeup usually it takes me like two hours no lie so I was like damn like I'm almost done I'm gonna have time to chill before work but no I forgot to put bronzer on and I forgot to put on my highlight what I usually use for bronzer now another very inexpensive the bomb thing um hair it gotta put my hair out of my face double duty it's a wet and dry pressed powder foundation and then this is the old two one it's so bomb um as you can tell like I've hit pan so I mean I'm not lying and then I don't really contour anymore I just feel it's kind of harsh like sometimes I really do but I mainly now I just like Browns my face the reason why I only just bronze is because I sold I don't know like I feel like it just it looks fine like once I stopped contouring like so intensely like I would have liked that straight line down my cheek like I've kind of felt weird but then like I asked my sister I was like dude do I even like that difference she was like no not really like it's just whatever and I was like I don't have to go extra so I was like why not why not just try bronzing and I just I don't know in my opinion I feel like it looks a lot better on my face and then that is kind of funny to say like Oh less fake more natural it's like bitch if you want to be natural just don't wear any makeup but honestly I kind of like I'm kind of like all or nothing you know it's kind of like if you're gonna do your makeup might as well just like beat your face you know like if you want to do like natural just put on mascara and that's it and then maybe like add some gimme brow or something so you can literally look natural but it's kind of funny to me when I see like natural makeup and you see that they put on like pounds of makeup on like I'm not hating but it's kind of like who cares dude like it's makeup like if you want to put on hella fucking makeup why the fuck not I really hate that people say oh she puts on how the makeup design I it's like who cares you know like I don't know if that's kind of I don't know how to explain myself so good but I hope that kind of makes sense like don't call it natural it's fine just say neutral it's like neutral colors you know like I really hope I explained that well and note that the way I kind of say what I want to say is it so clear sometimes like honestly I hate the fact that I like girls feel the need to justify what they do it's just like what the fuck cares you know I don't know like um there is this one guy who commented on my I put a comment on his video cuz he made a stupid oz video about oh how girls are at the gym and I was just like dude this is such a stupid video and the guy isn't even funny and this guy commented back because it was his video obviously you know and he was like I bet you're the type of girl to go to the gym with a full face you know like with hella makeup on and then like I was going to respond and then I was just like like why like why I don't need one I don't know him - do you really think that wearing a fuck ton of makeup to the gym is gonna make me work out like less how do I say it's gonna it's not going to make me work out less than I'm capable of working out like when I go to the gym with a full face of makeup on I fucking go hard when I go with there's some stuff on I still go as hard and then when I go with just maybe lashes and brows no liner no nothing I it's all the same it's like why do you feel the need to tell someone oh I bet you're that type of girl it's like do you like I'm probably going harder than you at the gym the fuck I don't mean to sound like a bitch or whatever but less shit like pisses me off so much you know it's just like you really think putting makeup on my face isn't gonna like I'm still gonna train hard you know whatever okay so for highlight I'm gonna be using this one from Mac this one's my favorite like when I got it I was like dude should I get it should I know I took me like a good ten minutes to decide to actually buy it and then this one is global glow and I'm just gonna put a lot of it not gonna lie on my cheekbones I literally have like the mirror like right in front of me I've never done my makeup like this so um let me know if this is okay like I know that my background is not so cute um but yeah if you guys don't mind these type of videos just I mean tell me I guess in the comments like oh these are cool like it's fun watching I guess I'm gonna go in with the tinted brow mascara um by NYX another inexpensive product see I'm not lying like these products are so bond and then I just go over that um I go over it lightly what the fuck am I saying see I you guys I can't talk I'm not going to cut that out because this is real life stuff like I noticed that I stopped breathing to to do my brows like I literally hold my breath and then like I don't know where like I'm just like and then like I just started laughing I was like damn even for my brows dude do it for the brows cool so now we're done with their face I got a little bit closer just so you guys can see what I'm doing I have this like little mini Urban Decay primer potion that I got as a sample oh my god I didn't even finish telling you guys about the gem thing like it just really pisses me off if you're a guy and you're watching this um and you like judge girls for that shit just like rethink what you say you know it's like really stupid when guys or even girls like they judge people for worrying makeup it's like you don't know if they just got off of work do like what if they feel like hella insecure without their makeup and you're over there making them feel bad you know it's like everyone has their own shit you know you guys really have to like watch what you guys say not to me cuz I feel like I don't get a lot of like hate comments like a lot of people are nice and I'm really really grateful for that but you guys just like may not like you exactly like I'm not directing it to you but I'm just saying like like everyone even myself like I have to think about shit that I say we have to all think about it because you don't know if they've like they've had the last straw in that day and like it what if that one thing that you tell them that just like throws them over the cliff or whatever the same is and they're dead no like you don't know you don't know people's situation I get so like I'm very very passionate about that like just being nice showing people that you care like having a big heart like don't be a bitch I don't know if your guy the judges or a girl also seem to you like just really think about the people you know like would you want someone to say that to your mom would you want someone to say that to your sister would you want someone to say hi to you for my um under the eyebrow I'm gonna be or I'm using this one right here it's so hard to do this I'm not used to doing that it's like a really big pallet and then I'm just using that for under the brow just to kind of set the concealer that I used to like kharbut do these shadows are so buttery like the first time I use them like I'm not used to them being this soft that they kind of like not crumble but they kind of um they're kind of messy and like the first time I use them I was like whoa like they're messy but they're so long so now I'm gonna go in with kind of like a brown it's a warm brown color it's right under the first yellowy one that I used this one right here the reason that you start off with lighter colors is just because it makes it so much easier to blend your eyeshadow and then that's how it looks so bond like if you're doing like a dark like burgundy eye or like a dark brown eye or a dark like black eye or like a dark smoky purple eye so you just start off slowly I know like some people are new and like they um they wonder how like people do it like that but that's how I was - at first like I would just put on like the harsh like just dark color one color cuz I didn't I honestly didn't know like I had to teach myself I had a pretty much just do the whole trial and error and that's like basically how I learned and then now people tell me that they like my makeup but I'm just like I guess thank you I mean I don't want to be like cocking like oh yeah because I honestly don't know if my makeups nice like people might say it's nice but is it really okay now I'm going to be taking the bag 217 brush and then with this one I'm gonna really like put it in my crease I'm gonna take more of a like this color and then maybe that color just to like build up ntencity because I did say I when I do like that like dark smoky Brown I I've also been wanting to dye my hair I've been trying to strip it at home I don't know if you guys can tell like it's kind of like a light gray in person some of it is like a green and it just looks really in my opinion it looks a little bit crazy but um I mean that's what I got for doing it myself right I don't think it looks that bad though but what do you guys think I really want to diet like I don't want to go to like a teal color or I want to I want to go back to purple or I want to do like a lavender but I just I'm so indecisive and sometimes I'm just like dude I should just go back to blah and then I'm just like nah because people tell me they like it and I don't know I feel like the Purple's really me but it's kind of a hassle to maintain it and then since I did dye it myself I feel like it doesn't look as good you know you get my feel so if you guys want to let me know what color I should do next like I'm open to any color like I wanted to do rose gold but um like I'm not sure if my hair is like gonna take it like I got some fucked up bastard so now that we have all of that on I'm gonna take my finger just so it's more in time I'm gonna just put it like um like on the lid because it kind of looks a bit lighter right there I'm going to go ahead and do my under arse and then same thing put it under here and just kind of connect on those two together I'm just packing on on the color and then with every shadow that I add it's good and it's just getting darker cuz I do want this to be very smoky I'm really into glitter so I'm going to go ahead and add some glitter on my inner corners because I don't really like how it looks when it's like that white thing like the white inner corners I think that it looks so funny on me this was like three dollars I think it's super inexpensive it's so bomb it's lasted me like damn I've had this since um I don't know if you guys knew but I used to work out Walmart and I've had it since I worked at Walmart because I bought it there and then what I do is I put my pinky in there and then I just put in my inner corners and I think it looks super bomb I'm gonna go ahead and do my eyeliner and then I'll come back and put on my lashes you guys already know my favorite lashes I'm actually stocked up here let me show you guys just to be a bitch so I have all of these just because I'm not obsessed like I'm I'm not gonna be without them I'm not gonna like run out I was like fuck no I'm gonna have these I'm gonna be stocked up for life every time I see them no matter what like I have one two three four five I have six backups but these are my favorite lashes so anytime I see them like I just grab them like fuck being without these they're so long okay now I have everything on I put all my lashes on my hair is in front now I put on mascara as well because I mean I didn't want you guys to like see me doing like you know like my face like that um so this is the final look it's very like warm very smoky in my opinion um usually I don't do this anymore but I don't know I think I came out nice I've also been thinking to do a Q and a because just so like the new people can get to know me I still want to do my lips I don't know what I'm planning to do I mean I'll probably just go for a neutral lip like always cuz why the fuck not I'm going to take max nice and spicy lipliner you this is the NYX soft matte lip cream in the color London and it's number four and I'm just gonna I hope it looks nice I'm gonna put that all over my lips all right so basically this is the finished love and I want to say thank you guys so much for watching let me know what color I should do my hair let me know if I should do the Q&amp;A and then just let me know what you guys think about like everything that I was saying and if there's any questions I'm going to leave all the products down in the little description box so please check that out and um I'll just see you guys in my next video you guys are awesome thank you so muchhey guys it's a that since the day I filmed a very glam Valentine's Day makeup tutorial and I

hydro fluid or water steel my foundation and then I'm gonna be taking some of this and just dyeing it all the my base and to buff this all into my face I'll be taking my Sigma flat kabuki brush and this is the f80 amber concealer I'm gonna be taking my Rebecca Stella free touch concealers I'm gonna be placing some on my under eyes and I'm going to be doing this in a triangle shape just because I really want the under eye space super super highlighted and I don't usually like to take it onto my forehead because I always feel like that's a little too much and to blend this and I'm going to be taking a damp Beauty Blender and just tapping it into my skin and I'm also going to be going in a cream contour so I'm gonna be taking my la girl Pro concealer and this is in the shade fun we see some here but here's a tip for you guys if you guys are going to be using this la girl concealer make sure that you only place product onto the places where you're going to be working on first because if you put it on all over your face if this does tend to set in really fast so I always recommend that you do the one area that you're gonna be doing first now taking some on my forehead but that said I'm going to be cleaning up this contour here and then just making lines with a concealer that we used earlier just to clean it all up and then the same thing for that bridge of my nose I'm just going go ahead and bake so for that I'm going to be using my it cosmetics powder don't they dry Beauty sponge I'm just going to be dipping it in here and just applying it to where I highlighted my face the excess power that I have in my sponge I'm going to be taking it right here in the center of my forehead because because of how I said earlier I don't litter like for it to be too intense though that will do it and then we will just wait to bake and while that is happening we are going to be applying some bronzer onto the places where we place the darker shade I'll be taking my cool a benefit bronzer and there's no surprise I love it so so much I'm going to be packing my brush with my bronzer and making sure that I get it on to every little place that's brown okay so we've been making for about 10 minutes and now I'll be taking my Sigma spotlight duster at 37 brush and I'm just going to be dusting away all the powder that we used to bake and for blush i'll be using this sigma chord the Rossa are a powder so I'll just be taking the same brush that we used to bronze up her face and just happen in there not to prime my eyes I'll be using my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion in the shade eaten so many be using this palette by Sigma it's called a smokescreen and it has a lot of nice warm brown shades and I think today I'll be going with this one here my brush I'll be using my Sigma tapered blending brush is just like 8:35 so I'll just be dipping my brush into this color here listen it go right above my crease and with the excess on my brush I will just be taking it on to my outer part of my eye and just make it a little bit more intense and opaque I'm just taking a little bit more just dabbing it in there and just really defining the outer part of my eye and now for the actual crease I'll be taking this Mahdi topi purplish grayish color here and I'll be packing my brush on with that color and taking it inside my crease and this is really just gonna help the transition shade and of the crease color just really blends together and that's going to help build a a color look a lot more flawless and see once and I'm going to be using this Sigma blending brush this is the e25 but it's flat so I'm going to be using it for my actual eyelid I'm going to be going in with this baby pink color and it has a little bit of shimmer into it but it's not too much don't the same brush I just cleaned it off a little and now I'm going to be taking this little brown color here has a little bit more shimmer onto it and I'm going to be running that on my lower lash line I kind of want to intensify the outer corner of my eye and also my lower lash line so I'll be taking this dark brown chocolate shade over here with my blending brush I'll be taking that same color and just dabbing it in there tapping off the excess and just pressing it onto the very outer part of my eye I kind of want some more dimension and sparkle into this look so in the very centers I'm going to be using this very pretty champagne pinky color and it's from the new tube the bomb palette standoffish I'll be taking some of that with my finger and just placing it in the very center of my eyelid so for today's eyeliner I'm going to be using this gel liner by cinema this is the wicked send out eyes and I'll be taking in their highly under brush this is the winged liner eo6 I never used gel liner so this is gonna be a really really intense for me so let's just hope that I don't fail so I finished Berliner and it also applied some falsies and these are the red cherry number AV twos and I love these because they're so full and plush and to blend it both my lashes together I'll be taking my Maybelline lash sensational mascara and when I apply mascara on to my lashes I always make sure that I only apply it onto the root just to blend both lashes together because I don't want to fully gunk up my lashes so I can reuse them more often so I just go from the root and blink a little now for lips I'm going to be lighting them with this colour-pop lippie pencil and this is in the shade oh snap announcer filling my lips I'll be taking this take my lipstick in the shade in spades

please make sure to give it any thumbs up and also subscribe to my channel if you haven't already so you will be notified whenever I post a new video and as always I will see you guys next timeI'm not trying to show you love and affection I'm trying to live the life a kid always expect is a big is a visit music hey guys welcome back to my channel so today is going to be a Netflix and chill makeup tutorial and I know what you're thinking not the nasty Netflix and chill like none of that just actually chilling like a more chill makeup look whether you want to watch Netflix with your bottle of wine with your friends or like me me and Molly my dog just hanging out or you know something just more casual I've been wearing this look a lot recently because I still look put together but it's not the crazy wink liner or smokey eye it's a lot more low-key for me and you can even make it more minimal than what I did but this is my more chill makeup look that I usually gravitate towards and every time I wear on snapchat or Instagram I always get tons of requests for a tutorial so I wanted to do it today because I know I've been doing a lot more glam look so I wanted to keep it a little bit more low-key today and I loved how much you can switch up this makeup look if you wanted to pair this look with a dark red lip automatically it's gonna look more glam or if you want to keep it more low-key you can add just a lip balm or not do lashes there's so many options you can do with this look and I think that's why I love it so much because I have so much freedom with colors and things I want to switch out with this tutorial so I really really hope you guys enjoy it if you do recreate it don't forget to tag me so if you want to see how I get this Netflix and chill makeup look then just keep watching so first I'm going to take some of this Eddy in facial spray all over it feels so good it just like refreshes your skin and preps it and it just feels amazing and especially during winter time when my skin gets a little bit drier I like to use this so I'm going to take a little bit of Mac soft over Paint Pot just some on my finger to prime my eyelids I'm not using really any eyeshadow today but it does even up my eyelids and makes everything look 1 tone because my eyelids like you can see they're a little bit darker so I'm going to go ahead and curl my lashes because this look is really just about highlight lashes color and then I'm taking the L'Oreal telescopic mascara and I'm going to apply this this is my favorite drugstore mascara makes your lashes so so long so while that dries we're going to move on to the face first I'm going to prime my face with these Smashbox primer water for my foundation I'm using the Maybelline matte and poreless with my Beauty Blender I told you guys is my current favorite foundation I have not been able to put it down I just like to start on the outside of my face and work inwards and a little bit of this foundation goes a long way it blends so easily I like tons of redness around my nose and it just covers everything up it's 64 degrees today that's insane it's December I always like to blend a little bit down my neck too just to make sure there's no demarcation line so now I'm going to fill in my brows I'm using the Anastasia brow Wiz in dark brown I'm going to kind of speed through this because it's just how I always do but I like to start on the bottom part of the brow make my little arch kind of feather the front up a little bit you use really light strokes you don't want to put a lot of pressure towards the front you don't want it to look really harsh and then I take the brush and I brush the hair downwards just so I can kind of see the shape I want on the top I've been doing a straighter brow recently and I really like it so for my lashes I'm using lashes in the city from the lower these are the lashes I've been wearing and all of my pictures on a dream where I've done this look and I wear them all the time without any eyeshadow or anything and they just look so full and wispy and I love them one of the keys to wearing lashes is letting the glue dry you want the lash glue to get tacky before you try to apply them or else you just keep pushing it and it doesn't stick on the lashes so I let mine dry for 30 seconds before I apply I'll squeeze the false lashes and my natural lashes together while I'm like pushing it on the lash line just to get it as close as possible sometimes I'll take a felt tip eyeliner I have this one from eiko and I'll go over the band it just depends on how the lash glue dries so I'm going to let the lash glue dry and see if I need to so moving on to concealer I'm going to take the NYX HD concealer in the shade of beige to highlight and also cover up any dark circles I'm just going to blend it out with my Beauty Blender then I'm going to set my concealer with the mat shaping powder in the shade of the size and this brush from morphe this is the more feet m4 3/8 you just want to Pat it underneath the eye so you don't disrupt and move the concealer you just want to set it and this also brightens up the concealer a little bit more so I'm gonna take this nude eyeliner from NARS and that same brush just to hold down my lash line so I don't mess up my concealer I'm going to fill in my waterline with this color it just makes your eyes look a lot brighter a lot more awake and a little bit thicker so I'm going to be trying out the new chart contour chart tardies tart TARDIS TARDIS it comes with two contour shades to correcting highlight shades a blush shade and I believe this is a shimmer highlight color it smells so good smells like cocoa like the Too Faced chocolate stuff that's what smells like we're going to start with this contour color apply a little bit right here right there look good then I'm going to switch to this morphe fluffy brush and take the lighter contour color to blend it out and they set this I need two oranges so I'm going to take two colors for my blush they're both from Mac they're mineralized colors first I'm going to take out pine bronze on a duo fiber brush and I'm just going to apply that right over my contour then I'm going to mix some of a warm sole right on top so for my highlight I'm going to take champagne pop from Becca and I'm going to apply that right on the high points of my cheeks then to make it a little bit more fleeky i'm going to take some of mary lou manizer from the balm it's a lighter champagne color and apply it right on top if you can't see my highlight in the dark then there's something wrong with it and then I'm going to take some of that on the inner corners as well Loen all day I'm going to finish off the eyes with mascara I'm going to use the Rimmel lash accelerator on the lower lashes this is my favorite mascara for lower lashes it's the only one that I've used it doesn't like bleed have to be so careful when I'm doing my mascara on my lower lashes I feel like I always screw it up so now I'm going to set my face with the urban decay DEET slick setting spray so now I'm going to go to change and fix my hair and when I come back I will finish with the lip color so for my lip color I'm going to start off with makeup forever lipliner and a shade 3c so I'm going to be mixing a few different lip glosses today and I want them to show up true to color so I'm going to be taking this lippy stick from colour-pop in the shade skimpy it's a really pale nude and I'm going to apply this all over so that way my lips are a little bit more muted though it's kind of like mist from Mac is what it reminds me of so I'm going to start with a little bit of rose from dose of colors I think this has glitter in it because the texture is kind of gritty I don't really like the texture of this gloss but I love the color of it so you look like a bobby rose color and then I'm actually going to apply a little bit of Mack Flor abundance right on top this is more of like a peachy nude color so here's the finished look I really hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and to subscribe to my channel if you did now I'm

Cecilia --nz so today I'm doing a everyday face routine I know I did a foundation routine mmm a couple or maybe a month ago or my previous video but today I want to fill my everyday face routine this can contain like how are contour highlight what I use stuff like that so without further ado let's get started so I really went ahead and moisturize my face with my cleaning clear door action moisturizer this is really good for dry skin and for priming my face I like to use the Make Up For Ever step one skin equalizer this is the nourishing primer so it makes your face really hydrated I only really love this stuff so I'm just gonna take hello not little maybe like a little pea-sized I apply this all over my face cuz it gives your face every hydrated feel and it doesn't and for me I have really dry skin so this really works so make sure to put it on my nose because I get really dry there I don't know my eyes I'm not on my head coz I can't really drive there too then also I like to use the Tarte clean slate primer this stuff is really good as well so I take a little bit of that let's have a lot and it's very weird texture so just be aware so I put this under my eyes to stop the creasing because it is like a very I don't know what the texture like I don't know how to explain it it's a gonna a bomb basically it's really weird but works really good so I put that on my nose and then on my forehead just because I crease there like when I like go like that throughout the day it starts to crease I just really just well that into my skin then start dabbing and I just work it in there so now for foundation I love to use the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation it okay so I think my finger a problem back of my hand and I'm just gonna apply those on my face now I'm gonna take my morphe M 439 oh my gosh I can finally hit on them such a beauty guru now that I have a morphe brushes but imma take this brush and I'm just gonna work that into my skin so now for concealing I want to use three different types of concealers I'm going to use the NARS radiant creamy concealer la girl Pro concealer add the Mac prep and prime and what it says bright forecast so when you use the NARS first as a base I shouldn't really need this down but that's alright still does a good job and also it the Hawaiians a little bit harsh you're gonna Cesar foundation brush and just go over those liens so now on top of that I'm going to apply bright forecast for Mac and this is just a light boost and just make sense how they look really bright can see I don't if you can tell what off the light is washing it out let's stuff it up he's really that I like it I just do that help my nose and then just a little bit on my forehead so now I'm gonna set my face with a mac mineralize skinfinish in dart and I'm gonna use the more Fujio brush this is the metal collection make sure to get your net - if you're bringing a foundation that's a little darker so now I'm gonna go ahead and bake my face the laura mercier translucent powder and I don't make my entire face the only parts that I bake or like she are under like great cheekbones so it looks really sharp I don't think under my eyes I just said it lightly with powder the reason for this is because I have dry skin I have dry skin so it looks really dry if I make my whole entire face so I like doing this step because it makes my contract really good deal so I thought you look a little bit crazy but it comes out good I promised and then I was like whatever is left on that sponge and I'll just go into my eye and said that and I don't want big my under eyes cuz it gets really dry there throughout the tape so I'll just lightly set it so while we are baking I'm gonna go ahead and contour I'm gonna use my own jasja contour kit and I'm gonna use a shade hook bottom and copper Brown with the morphe m-52 3 brush looks like this and I'm gonna take home oh I don't know start contouring but it's forming that line and some of your powder gets goes away you can just take that sponge and just apply more if you need take a brush I just bring my hair a little bit back and I blend it to them into my hair muscle looks very natural and whatever's left on the brush I'll bring that to my son boy to come to my nose I'm gonna use a little bit of Havana with the more feet m5 224 brush I'm gonna take that I'm just gonna follow my natural shape on top so I'm taking a little bit of copper Brown I'm putting that right here and it just makes your nose a little bit smaller is that that illusion I feel like I'm Adam take Ivana and I'm going to just go down a copper Brown and I'm just gonna go upwards click up up okay now imagine this BH Cosmetics a fluffy blending brush a little bit of hope on that anywhere who's gonna blend okay so now for highlighting I'm going to take my own associate lumineer there in Riviera and I'm doing a thorough techniques brush and I'm just applying this to the tip and then I was gonna go start a little bit higher and your high looks a little bit too bright or too stark whatever to go in with your powder brush and just blend that away now I'm going to use my chocolate Hill champagne pop I'm going to highlight really bright highlights why just applying it okay and then I don't you got real techniques brush I'm going to apply two hundred my brow bone now to slip away the powder I'm going to use my morphe geo brush with my mineralized skinfinish again I'm just going to go back and forth the skin so let's watch it for the face now we can burn the eyes the eyes are really simple but before we work on the eyes I'm to use my assignment rising miss from Kevin to fun ba not sure I pronounced out but for someone I'm moisturizing mist I just go away so I really like to have Lea platic it's very moisturizing and it feels really good on the skin so uh now you can work on the eyes so for me I'd like to keep it really simple it really depends where I'm going but if I'm gonna go to the store are gonna go out somewhere really casual I'll go in with I didn't come from skip right here and I'm gonna use my shirt help with landing brush and I'm just gonna go in the otterby the outer corner and I just blend this so my eyes have a little bit of color and then I'll mix it in with some saddle or a saddle from Mac and I'll just plug that into my crease and that I'm going with my morphe one is this the my 1 9 brush going a little bit of embark and I'm going to put on my lid and then I'm going to the same sheriff you're blending brush and I'll just blend in bark out asked for highlighting I'll go in with all that glitters from math and I'll apply it out into the outer corner and sometimes I'll even apply that onto the lid I'll just do that right now so today so usually I apply some false lashes but today I keep it simple and just add mascara so I'm gonna curl my lashes with this wash color I'm not I like with shopping you store for mascara I love to use this mascara this is from Mac and it is called false lashes extreme Vlad unfortunately it's not waterproof so I think I might need a purchase but in water provided we know if they sell this and waterproof fighters like those so I just will go back pretty much it and now I'll just usually apply some lipstick this is resistance from not been loving the shades on so that's pretty much it of my everyday makeup routine it's pretty simple it's pretty quick I feel like um but yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video and I will see you guys on my next one bye guyshi guys welcome to my Channel today I'm be doing my first makeup tutorial I asked you guys on Instagram what you guys want to eat Birds majority of you guys said everyday makeup routine or go to love also if you guys already know my hair extension you're now available online I'll have the links and like discount code below enjoy comment down below what you got next thank you for watching guyshey guys and welcome back to my channel today's makeup tutorial was going to be on this winged liner and a bold brow look to get started as always I'm gonna be taking my soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac and I'm gonna be applying this all over my eyelid from my lid to my brow with my fingers and I'm just gonna make sure to blend this nice and evenly and make sure that the layer is quite thick then I'm going to take the Too Faced chocolate bar palette and the first shade we're going to take is this nice peachy brown shade and this is going to be our first transition shade this is gonna make everything else blend really nicely and it's also a really nice warm color to start off the whole look with don't worry about how neat this is because we are going to kind of clean up the lid with a lighter color next I'm going to be taking this milk chocolate shade and we're going to be using this as the darkest crease color for today you can go for a darker color if that's what you like but I wanted to keep the eyeshadow quite natural today and also what's nice about this look is that all the eyeshadows are matte also so I'm just applying that with a crease brush and then I'm also going to be going back in with another blending brush and just going to blend everything out so that it all looks nice and seamless then I'm taking this white shade and I'm just gonna be applying this all over my lid this is just going to clean up the lid like I said and this is just gonna make it all look really nice and bright this is a really nice color just to make our eyes look nice and open nice and bright and it just kind of finishes off the look and I'm kind of just going in a nice sweeping motion towards the crease just to create a cut crease effect and what I'm doing right now is just packing on the color because it's a matte shade to kind of pack on a lot of pigment you just want to go in patting motions next I'm just going to be cleaning up the edges of my eye just to make sure that my eyes have been nice and cleaned up and the edge is nice and precise then I'm going to get slide with my eyeliner you guys know that I have done eyeliner videos before in the past I have done a how to wing your line at like a pro so if you do want to check out that video I will pop it in the description box before you what I'm just doing at the moment it's just creating a nice thin line on my lid and just connecting the wing that we just created and just connecting it to the line on our eye and I do great this kind of look in my how to winger liner like a pro video so I will link that for you if you want to see a more in-depth version but I do really like this nice simple wing it's nice and thick towards the end but it's a little bit thinner on the lid then I'm going for a nice pair of false lashes these are the ILA one to six lashes and I'm just applying this onto my lid with some tweezers I'm just applying some mascara to my natural lashes to make them blend into the false ones next I'm just applying some gel liner to my waterline and then we are going to move on to our base for my skin I'm going to be taking the Mack natural radiance primer and should be applying it all over my skin I'm just blending it all around my face just to hydrate and prep my face for foundation then I'm taking a mix between two foundations the Bourjois healthy mix and the Maybelline Dream satin liquid this foundation mixture is one of my favorites it gives me just enough junus but it also does still look like a really nice amount of coverage it's kind of a medium coverage and I just feel like it's enough especially for the summer it's a really nice coverage and I mix the two colors together because it kind of creates my perfect tanned shade I'm just blending that all together with the Real Techniques sculpting brush once that's all blended in I want to go into some concealer just to highlight these areas and also to conceal also my skin is doing pretty well at the moment so I don't have much to conceal so I'm kind of using less concealer applying it in spots kind of just makes everything look a lot lighter I'm just applying them in little dots all over my face and this is just going to highlight these areas and make them look lighter and it's also going to have a nice contrast between the lighter and the dark part of my face to get into all the little areas that that brush couldn't reach I'm going to be taking my Sigma 3d HD precision brush you guys know I love this brush and it just gets into all the areas that are harder to reach and then I'm just going to be taking my Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit and setting my concealer with the banana shade and I'm just using this on a real techniques setting brush just kind of packing this on all the areas we apply the concealer just to highlight and also set them areas to then I'm taking the bronze II shade I'm going to be using this to bronze my skin and I'm just using this on a big fluffy brush to kind of diffuse the product all over my skin evenly and I'm just applying it under my cheek bone onto the sides of my forehead and I'll also be applying it onto my jaw line to contour I'm going to be taking the form shade from that same contour kit and just be applying this with a smaller contour brush onto the deepest hollows of my cheeks and I'm also going to be taking it onto the sides of my forehead this is just going to narrow down my face next time we'll be taking some of the Ben Nye banana powder and just using this underneath my contour just to make the contour look a little bit sharper and I do really like this step I think it looks really nice and it kind of just cleans up anywhere where you applied a little bit too much bronzer or contour then I'm just highlighting my face with my Laura Geller gilded honey highlighter and I'm just applying this with a big fluffy brush onto the tops of my cheekbones and also onto the tip of my nose next I'm gonna be filling in my brows today I went for a much stronger browser than you guys are probably used to seeing me with I wanted to kind of pair the winged liner with a really nice defined brow the kind of brow that everyone is pretty much wearing at the moment so first I'm going in with the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is in dark brown just to kind of sculpt out the shape that I want and to also sort of create that arch and I'm just kind of brushing that through the brows to make it look quite natural I'm leaving the inner part of my brow free of any product and then I'm taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow powder and just taking an angled brush and applying this closer to the inner part of my brow still leaving the very first part of my brow free then I'm taking sort of like an eye brow pomade but this one is from Mac and I'm just applying this on to the outer part of my brow to give it a nice defined look and then I'm just taking some concealer to finish off the brow and to highlight everything off and then also to keep all the brows in place I'm going to be going in with some of the clear brow gel from Anastasia also and then to finish off the eyes I wanted to apply it some gel eyeliner onto the inner corner to create a tiny little flick on the inner corner this just makes everything look a lot more cat eye like and it really defines your eyes in a really nice way and then I'm just applying some of that brown shadow onto my bottom lash line and then I'm going to apply some mascara to today I'm lining my lips with stone at lip pencil from Mac this is an amazing lip color if you want to kind of have a little bit more of that grungy gray effect I really like this kind of lip color but I didn't want it to be too grey so I also went in with Mac saw lip liner and kind of applied it more to the center of my lip this kind of gave across a really nice and dusty rose color and because I didn't want it to be too dark I went in with this nude lipstick from Rimmel this is from the new room or Kate Moss collection and I'm just applying it all over and just making sure to blend my lips together just so that they looks nice and nude and then to set that all and make it look into a really nice matte lipstick I'm just going on top of that with a little bit of translucent powder and this just makes everything look super matte so guys that's the end of this look I hope that you guys enjoyed this really simple but extra glam

tutorial I want to show you guys the palette that I'm featuring today which is the anastacio shadow couture world traveler palette which I have been obsessed with and the colors that I'm using are like the brownish ones I use a little bit of the purple and also the pink champagne which is my favorite color and I used on the lid I'm a saucy did an amazing job at formulating these eyeshadows because they're all the anasazi eyeshadows are amazing and they work beautifully especially if you don't really know how to blend the colors blend out themselves literally and then also on my lips I'm wearing one of the new liquid lipsticks from the Fall collection if you guys are too scared to wear like a really really dramatic color like this I would say go minimal on the eyes and don't like do too much but since I was feeling glam luck today I was like are I'm going to go super Jurado can totally switch up the lip color you can use a red or burgundy a dark red or even a nude I was kind of like wanting to do a nude but like I said I was really excited to use these hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and if you want to know how to achieve this look then please keep on watching so as always I'm going to go ahead and prime my eyes with soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac this is just going to help all of our eyes shadows stick on all day and it's going to help the color show up exactly like what it looks like in the actual palette because I know for a long time I struggled with that I like to mainly focus most of the product on the lid and then slowly fade upward because on the lid is where we use the color that we want to be most pigmented in this case it's going to be the shimmery one in the UH Nastasia palette to start this look I'm going to go ahead and be taking the color Morocco from the Anasazi palette and I am taking a blending brush and we're going to go ahead and say that I speeded the video up so it doesn't take this short amount of time for those of you who think that it takes no time at all it's totally a lie but make sure you take your time with this step because this step is going to make or break your eyeshadow so make sure to blend out everything very very seamlessly and I went in with my Sigma e-40 which is another clean blending brush just to go ahead and clean up any rough edges you taking an angled shader brush I'm going to go ahead and pick up the color soft peach which is a matte creamy shade and we're just going to use this right underneath our eyebrows to highlight our eyes using a tinier fluffy brush I'm going to go in with the color fudge and I'm going to be applying this on the outer corners of my eyes I like to use this brush to specifically deposit and then I go in with another brush which is a dupe for the Mac 217 and this one is by morphe and I like to blend out the color that I applied with a smaller brush and you can go ahead and keep adding just depending on how dark you want your look to be you now this is my personal favorite step going to go ahead and take this flat shader brush which is by far one of my favorite shader brushes it totally beats the Mac 239 it works well with dry products and as well as cream which is super duper duper hard to find and then I went in with a color called pink champagne which is the best color in the pole palette and applied this on top of the primer and just keep packing it on until you reach your desired amount so now I'm going to go ahead and line my eyes I sped this up really quickly because if I were to not speed it up we would be here for literally like 15 minutes next I'm going to go ahead and go in with my brown retractable liner by la girl to line the bottom I didn't use black because I didn't want it to be too harsh and Brown always add some softness to the look since we're already going really really dark with the gel liner and I like to apply this on the lower lash line as well and this is how I achieve my smoked out look you can go ahead and add whatever color eyeshadow that you want on top of this but for this specific look I wanted to use the purple in the palette and I used it that same little tapered brush that we used earlier on in the tutorial to apply the brown on the outer corners of the crease so then with a smaller brush I went ahead and grabbed pink champagne and the color chick / chic to highlight the inner corners of our eyes and I'm going to go ahead and use my Alex faction lashes and by the way I do have a coupon code these are by far my favorite mink lashes at the moment to finish up the look you can totally use whatever lashes that you want to use now moving on to the skin I'm going to go ahead and prime my face with the NYX HD primer I like to use this one specifically when I want to be really really dramatic and I want my makeup to last on all day I believe it does have SPF which is why it kind of gives me like a white cast so don't worry about that because your foundation that you apply on top of that will go ahead and cover that and in this case I am using my matte foundation by NARS and I never really pick up this foundation but since I want to try something new I went ahead and used it so go ahead and apply your desired amount I would suggest to apply a lot because you can never wear too much makeup and I always always always always use my Beauty Blender to blend out my foundation just because I feel like brushes tend to make my face look streaky you now I'm taking my la girl pro conceal you really don't have to do this step but I really feel like this step adds to the effect of the highlight and contour I use the yellow just because I am a yellow undertone so if you are a yellow undertone this would be perfect to use and I just use this underneath the eyes because this is going to brighten I guess it's kind of like a reverse step of like instead of using the banana powder you kind of use it as a cream but since it's a little bit too yellow for me I always apply the classic ivory concealer right on top of that which is another one by la girl as well and with this one I'm going to be applying it all over to the highlighted areas which would be the forehead down the nose Cupid's bow chin underneath the eyes and then I like to add a little bit right underneath where my contour is going to be just to add a little bit more to the dramatic mists of this look you can totally skip this step and you don't have to use as much makeup as I'm using but like I said I love to wear makeup so for the contour shade I'm going to use the color toast and I use a little bit with this one be careful with this concealer because it is super pigmented and if you apply too much it's going to be a hot mess so don't don't get overwhelmed when you like blend out the like the contour color because you can always go back and blend in with like a foundation to help like dilute the darkness of the shade you take your time with this because this video is sped up and I can't emphasize that enough because a lot of people kind of like make these videos and people are like what the like why is it mine as perfect as hers in the video but you have to understand that when you record these videos it's kind of like different than when you're doing it like on yourself so just take your time because typically it takes me about an hour to do my makeup not 12 minutes so now I'm going to go ahead and set my foundation and I'm using my Beauty Blender for this step I like to pack it on this is a way to make your foundation last all day you guys hear that it's like a computer giving up cuz I've been editing this damn video for like eight hours so go ahead and leave this on your face for about I would say a minute maybe thirty Seconds to a minute and then you can go ahead and dust it off with a brush any brush will work and then whatever you have left over go ahead and kind of like apply it over where you apply your contour because remember we haven't set that to go ahead and just kind of like buff that in there going into my honest asik on Turkey I like to mix the last two colors just because I feel like none of the colors kind of fit me so I kind of just mix all of them with my fan brush I love love love this brush because it gets right into the hollows of my cheeks making it super easy for me to contour so I go ahead and use this for my contour and then for my highlight and for my blush as well so the highlight that I'm using is called opal what I hate about highlights is sometimes like when I breakout it kind of highlights like my little pimple so I'm just like I'm kind of screwed but whatever or my Bush apparently I didn't use my fan brush but you can go ahead and use the fan brush or whatever brush you want to use um I don't remember what purchase thing I think this is by Sigma but the blush and I'm using in Spring Sheen I have a very light hand when it comes to that because I personally don't like blush at all so the mascara that I'm using is one by hot makeup I also have a coupon code for that I will go ahead and make all my coupon codes down below and all the products that I use today because it is so many products you need to like list or like verbally say in the video and then I am using my honest hacia liquid lipstick in the colour sepia to finish off the complete look so that is pretty much it I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know what you guys want in the comments down below even though it's going to take me like probably like a month to like finally get to it but ain't better late than never so I'll see you guys in my next videohey Miu nice I don't know if you guys follow me on Instagram but I recently hold a new ATAR palette and I wanted to use that today and I put this look together and I really liked the way it came up so enjoy let's get started and I'm going to give you with my bare face but don't run away my dry desert face sneeze priming and moisturizing so I use these products and I'm using oil sell lip treatment and for my foundation today I'm going to use NARS sheer glow foundation in Punjab and applying that everywhere on my lids like dotting Dammam and I'm going to buff it out with Real Techniques expert face brush and for concealing and highlighting I'm using NARS radiant creamy concealer in vanilla 1 and I'm blending that out with a blending blender blending blender Beauty Blender this dish is real magic I am loving it and I'm using emphasize and banana powder from a nostalgia skit to set my under eye concealer I'm using hourglass diffuse light powder on the high points of my face and where I apply my concealer this is a perfect topper for the under eye area and avoids any fallouts from sticking on to your face next obviously I need to do my brows and I'm going to fill them in using brow Wiz from anistar just and this is the color in soft brown you used to use her dip brow or her brow powder but this has been my go-to way to do it it's easier faster and quicker okay and then I'm just going to fill them in also I'm using brow gel clear one from our line best brow gel ever keeps my hair in place all day long if you have long crazy brow hairs like me you need to get this you will thank me later okay I'm going to carve my brows and I'm using Smacks studio finish concealer in NC 20 this just makes my brows look more crisp and sharp after my brows I'm going to prime my eyes using Urban Decay's anti-aging primer and Mac's soft ochre Paint Pot and I obviously use too much I went cuckoo with that anyways let's start with the eyeshadows I'm using free spirit and I'm blending that all over my eyelids as a base and I'm going to apply the color supermom to my lids this is a beautiful beige matte highlight color I used luscious fresh cleanser to wash my face and I somehow always managed to leave the residue on my hairline so that's what you see there in case if you're wondering next I'm going to apply the color force of nature on my crease and blending it out what I like about this palette is that they have a lot of blending colors in transition colors and this color is perfect for that and I use Coastal Scents 250 brush to apply this and I'm pointing at best friends but I'm actually applying natural beauty right next to it it's a light purple Toby brown shade the names for the shadows are so cute that's another reason why I love this palette I highly recommend this palette it's beautiful love the packaging love the colors in this palette they're old mats pigmented creamy blendable so far I'm really enjoying this palette besides the Mac smiler I only use this palette today but back to a tutorial I'm using two blending brushes to apply the color and blending it out and then I'm taking best friend with next to a seventeen brush and I'm going to darken the crease up even more and I'm going to take it a little bit higher than my crease so I get the Graduate ombre look and I'm going back and forth with same brush not the same brush the Coastal Scents 250 brush and Max 217 brush and I'm going to go in with 441 brush from crown brush to buff everything out these brushes are my homies right now yeah I want to try Sigma brushes but they're kind of expensive so I'm holding off on them for now I'm going to take the darkest shade cold bombshell and that's the darkest purple I love this shade and I'm going to make a soft cut crease look I know I make the most unflattering facial pressures when I apply makeup but I can't help it I'm so weird anyways back to the makeup and I'm doing more blending using Coastal Scents 250 brush so I'm going back with free spirit and applying that to my eyelids and also applying that to my brow bones and there's a plane outside I actually apply a little bit of caregiver and supermom on my lids to make it more pinky hair is better with the purpley shades that I'm using next I'm using the color best friend from the palette and I'm going to apply that to the lower lash line and I'm not going to take the color all the way to my inner inner tear-duct I'm going to flick it downwards keeping the very inner part untouched if that makes sense and I'm going to blend it out and make sure you use a precise brush to do this so you have a clean application I think it's self-explanatory so I'm just going to let you watch the video and to blend out I'm using natural beauty with a bullet brush so it looks soft and smoky now going back with free spirit and I'm going to highlight to the inner part where I didn't touch and by doing this it defines the inner part where we wanted to make it look like it's flicked down and I wanted to make it look more darker on my lower two-thirds of my eyelids or lower lashline so I'm going to apply bombshell with the same brush and I'm going to smoke it out finally I'm going to blend everything out with the Coastal Scents 250 brush and I'm using still as waterproof smudge stick pencil and damsel to waterline my eyelids eyelids lash line waterline what what am I saying I meant waterline and I'm going to use this Japanese version of Kat Von D tattoo liner to make a nice long winged line and then I went over the line with the makeup forever ink liner to make the eyeliners look Matt I went kind of too thick on my other eyes so I used a concealer to correct that cuz I up my eyeshadow so it's all balanced with the long winged eyeliner that I just applied this final touch makes the look all come together I can film this part but I apply a few coats of mascara and I'm moving on to my favorite part lashes I'm using Lena by lashes today and I'm using the left side of the lashes it's called Bianca these were total splurge but they are 50% off they're usually $40 per pair these are my first mink lashes and I'm obsessed these just look so full and beautiful okay next I'm moving on to bronzing my face I'm using Bobbi Brown's brazley powder in natural one and I'm using blush brush by Real Techniques and applying that all over my face perfect bronzing powder loving it next I'm going to contour my face using Anastasia contour kit in color fawn and I'm using the EDA brush and you know the drill beast rub each eked can use some contouring so that's what I'm doing and I also used Havanna on my hollows on my cheeks and I'm going to use bond to contour my nose and this is my new Becca blush hold well honey and I love it it's a beautiful coral bronzy like blush next I'm using miler by Mac this is a like off-white color and I'm applying that to the inner part of the tear duct to just define and intensify the inner part of the eyelids where we kept it blank and let's make some goofy faces okay moving on to my lips I'm using Jordana's rock and Rose lip liner I use this so much Jim in my videos I will switch it up once in a while and do some bold colors and I used a velvet teddy from Mac and on top of that I mixed a myth from Neff to love these combination like I cannot get over how beautiful this myth look on top of anything so loving it and I'm almost out so I bought a new one okay so this is the final look hope you guys like it and I'm sorry I was going pretty fast but it's not a real tutorial it's more like I'll get ready with me tutorial and I just wanted to do a voiceover with it so I hope you liked it and if you have any questions please put that down below in the comment section and subscribe and like bye see you guyshello cookies it's Siri I'm back and today I'm going to show you this Karrueche Tran inspired makeup look and the thing is it's people on instagram who told me that I looked like her and I was like really okay well she's so super beautiful and I've never ever thought that I looked like her so it's like well I might do a makeup look inspired by one of her photos just for fun and this is what I came up with first I'm applying my next photo loving primer all over my face then Mike and c42 foundation that I'm dabbing all over the face again onto the light concealer I'm applying it as I usually do and I'll put a link somewhere here guys if you want to see my usual highlight contour when I go for full highlighting and contouring up to the dark part of the concealer basically I'm doing it differently so I'm making my nose much bigger and I'm ending it under the eyebrows which I usually never do and then on the forehead I'm doing this line up here that I usually don't do a verbal I'm just trying to more or less match the facial structure she has on that photo a little bit of powder of course to set everything in place and then I'm doing the eyebrows so for the eyebrows I just watched her tutorial and I'm following the way she does it so I'm just feeling under the eyebrow first and here I'm actually doing a longer brow because she's doing her brows much longer than I usually do so I'm just dragging it a little bit more like so and then I'm just basically filling the eyebrows in here I'm starting to frown not because I'm pissed but more because I see that she also has much sharper eyebrows so by frowning I can see where it should be sharper on top there this is a step that I usually never do but I can see on the food that she has some foundation or concealer going on under her brow and over the eyebrow to highlight it and make it more clean I guess so that's what I'm doing now I'm just taking some foundation and a concealer brush from Ferris cosmetics and yes within my edges lumineer shadow primer that I'm applying all over my lids BH Cosmetics eyes on the 80s palette and I'm taking this warm brown color that I'm applying on the crease next I'm taking this champagne cutter that I'm applying as a highlight under my eyebrow now I'm taking black heart from my Naked 3 palette and I'm just dabbing it all over my eyelid then I'm curling my eyelashes with this torture device Maddy Ostrow favorite mascara of course darks one of them mark lashes that are perfect because they're slightly longer at the edges Casa Vega products had a primer on the tip of my nose and then this is something that I usually don't do it on the chin and on the forehead but I can see that on the photo she has some glow going on on these areas as well so that's what I'm trying to reproduce and then of course on my cheekbones which I kind of always do the highlighter itself Adam Devine on the forehead on the tip of my nose on my chin on my cheekbones basically everywhere will have the primer onto the lips I'm just grabbing some random warm brown lip liner and I'm lining my lower lip the same as I would usually do so just physically lighting it with the brown liner and then my upper lip I'm trying to make it much smaller so I'm lining inside my natural lip shape because I can see on the photo that she has a smaller smaller upper lip and a bigger lower lip and then has a beauty nude with a hybrid lipstick that I really love along dressed up in everywhere and as you can see I drew lines with the brown lip liner on my bottom lip to accentuate the effect of a bigger bottom lip compared to the smaller upper lip I'm just using some regular powder as a bronzer because I don't think I own any bronzer really and if I were to bronze I'd rather have a matte one and I never bronze but I can see as well on the photo that she's using a bronzer so I'm just taking a darker powder that is Matt Andres bronson everywhere and this is basically the final look I usually never pose in my videos because I'm not really good at that so bear with me but I'm doing it this time because I really want you guys to see how the makeup looks like and yeah that's about it I hope you liked it thank you so much for watching I hope you kids enjoyed this video if you did please give me thumbs up and subscribe if you don't want to miss all the upcoming videos and let me know the comments down below as well what do you think about people say that look like Karrueche because she's like super beautiful she has a really nice facial structure and we just don't have the same facial structure of this that's what I think and my boyfriend said the same thing so that you know the comments down below if you agree if you disagree so that I know and until next time see you cookies at the next video byeHey ladies welcome to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing a highly requested video decided to do a winged eyeliner tutorial then highly requested so I'm super excited to do this for you guys I hope it works out and I hope you guys enjoy and understand what's coming out of my mouth now I didn't realize how difficult this would be to film and talk through while I was filming so I decided to just do it a taco vert so if you see my mouth move in change of plans Hey ladies okay so I kind of started off with something very cat I like I kind of wanted to play around my makeup and do something that would accentuate this tutorial so I chose this really pretty cut crease and if you're interested in how I did this cut crease I could do a tutorial on that no problem it's very pretty it's all matte yeah I just thought I'd clear out my makeup and do something fun this okay so like my brow technique technique I'm going to be using two different products that people can use now you could use a gel product or liquid product I'm going to be doing these two different techniques because I don't know what you have so instead of going out and buying whatever technique I do use it will work for both so if you have a liquid liner you can do this tutorial if you have a gel you could do that as well now my favorite liquid liner is from Sephora this is jet jet black it has a brush applicator and it's really really good um has the applicator looks like this and it's just a brush tip so in this really blog the one downfall I would say for this is that if you plan on crying this will run and it will run heavy so I would not recommend you get this if you're going to be going to a wedding and you plan on crying your eyes out so don't don't use this but it's essentially it's a really really good product and it's it's pretty affordable compared to all the other products sold at Sephora and this one's called high precision liquid liner the next product I'm going to be using for my gel technique is my Inglot black gel in 77 now apparently this is the blackest gel liner on the market I really enjoy it's waterproof so if you wanted waterproof alternative if you plan on crying your eyes out at a wedding like me because I get so emotional when I see the bride yeah this is definitely a good alternative to that now currently I'm not wearing any liquid liner or mascara so let's just get on with it the first technique I'm going to show you is the gel technique now you're going to need a really thin brush applicator this is like the thinnest I could find it's from Mac and it's the 210 they have another one that's a little bit thicker but this is the most this is a very thin one and it works very well with gel liners now you can use this brush down but I don't really care to solve it the first thing you do is take some product onto the brush and kind of twist it in the product making sure the brush is properly quoted up quoted coated and kind of a movie access on a brush by twisting it on the side of the gel and you could also use the lid but yeah alright so the first thing you want to start off with is if you have a smoky eye or what not you want to make sure that the smokey eye ends where the eyeliner ends so if you're going to do a winged liner you don't want to do a winged liner and have the eye shadow smudging under the winged liner it could be your cut off to your eye shadow a really good way to to measure exactly what angle you should be applying your eyeliner on is following the end of your brows now creating that way liner you want to go ahead and go straight upwards essentially where your brow ends if you want you can go a bit lower you can go a bit higher but kind of at that angle is 45 degree angle just draw a line perfect okay so we created a line there the next thing I do is go ahead and line as closely as I can to my lash line and basically starting off in the inner middle corner and just kind of covering my lashes and if you have a really unsetting hand you can hold the brush closer to the tip and make smaller strokes this will help apply the product better on to your eye now that I've lined the eye closest to the lash line from the inner corner to the mid end of my eye there's a little gap right here and you want to make sure that it matches up perfectly now the trick is to create a straight line from the edge of the wink all the way to the to the people of your eye so I don't know if that makes sense does that make sense I make sure the end of the wing goes straight down into the middle of the liner I'm just going to bring the product in and go straight down you you Heys and for this last step I'm going to use my pinkie to kind of stretch out my inner tear duct area and drag the product sharply down the inner tear duct area okay so for this next technique I'm going to be using my liquid liner and this technique is my go-to technique I like this technique much better than the first one because it takes less time and I'm just very Swift with it but then again you do need product I mean so you do need practice what you're going to do is take the brush and kind of dab off the extra extra product off the brush making sure that the there's not it's not like goofing off of the brush now you're going to go ahead and create that straight line like we mentioned in the first technique going upwards and then I'm going to feather out words lightly so it gives me a sharper edge and once I do that I'm just going to take it and drag it back down to the inner section of my eye in a straight line and if you mess this up it's okay you could you could clean it up by just creating a little bit of a thicker wing but it does take practice now once you've filled in the intersection of the eye you want to take that same brush and make sure that you just straighten that line like I'm doing you by using smaller strokes and just covering the lashline of your entire eye as you do this you also want to make sure that it's matching up with the way and again for the inner corner you're going to want to drag your tear duct area stretch it out with your opposite thumb and bring the product down in to your tear duct area I like doing this because my eyes are kind of far apart so it brings them closer together so this is the finished tutorial I hope you enjoyed it and I hope it was easy to follow so this video has been so highly requested it's incredible I have any other requests please list them down in the description box or shoot me a message and inshallah I will add that to my list of videos I will be making I won't be happy to get back to them and if you want you guys want to know where

very helpful and thorough you know but ya have yourself a blast week and I'll see you next Wednesdayhey guys welcome back so today I have eight get ready with me video so I'm just going to jump right in and start with my eyebrows today I'm using my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Pro palette and I'm using a Anastasio brush as well and I'm just going to lightly fill in my brows today we're going to be using all makeup geek shadows so taking the shade creme brulée we're going to take a blending brush by morphe brushes and we're going to apply this into our crease because this is going to work as our transition shade taking the Vegas lights palette I'm going to take the shade roulette and I'm going to apply this into my crease I am using a sigma brush as always I will list the name of it in the description box below and I'm going to apply this all the way into the inner corners of my eyes I do really like this palette I feel like it's super unique because I don't have any colors that are similar to it and make a peak shadows you guys know are really good and they're super affordable so I'm thinking about doing a video with just my favorite shades because there's so many but I have like a little small palette which is like twelve of my favorite top makeup peak shadows so if that's something that you guys will want to see just let me know and I will love to do it for you guys on my lid I went ahead and applied Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and then I'm using my Inglot gel 77 eyeliner as well as a morphe brush you so if you follow me on snapchat you probably already know that my boyfriend is another country right now so he was facetiming me and I was like I miss you I miss you so much but I'm filming right now and I kind of reminded me of when we were in high school used to play baseball and we had like a long-distance relationship for like months a really long time and it just brought back all those memories so I just found that kind of funny so it's just crazy how like small things bring back so many memories but I'm going away of topic so let's go ahead and keep on with the makeup tutorial for a foundation today I decided to use my makeup forever matte velvet in the shade 40 I know you guys say that this foundation is a little bit too light for me but you have to realize that the foundation does oxidize and I used to wear 53 I started wearing 53 because you guys said that it was a little bit lighter but then 53 started to oxidize even more so it looked really dark on my face and it just it just looked really bad so I'm going back to 40 I really like how it looks on my skin and I applied it with a simply spoiled cosmetics punch which I really like and then I'm going to go in and apply my concealer and my highlight using a morphe brush this new collection by morphe brush is not even being sponsored by them but it is amazeballs you guys it's so good it's so soft and it feels super expensive to set my t-zone and my under-eye concealer I'm using a a new palette by simply spoiled cosmetics and I'm taking the yellow shade with this morphe brush it's also part of their collection just look at it it's so freakin good and it's super soft you guys to contour today I'm going to be using my favorite palette and it's the two-faced shizzle to perfection contour kit and I'm using in your brush this is the NARS eater brush the infamous brush I do really like it I feel like I don't have anything that's like it just because the bristles are super soft I have heard of people say that there's have fallen out but my friend Amy told me if you washed it a lot that happens so I'm going to take a really good care of it now moving on to my hair I'm going to apply some dry shampoo as always you guys know I love dry shampoo and I'm working on second day hair my hair like I told you guys before is super oily I cannot control it and that's just something that I have to deal with so this dry shampoo that I've been using is called a mica and you can find it at Sephora it's really good it doesn't have any residue you guys saw when I sprayed it on my roots it didn't have any left over so that's something that I really like and it smells so good it actually smells like you just left the salon and your hair is freshly done except in reality it's all by the way how cute does Mark look he looks so freaking adorable and I took him to get a haircut today and he's just like he's feeling post-acute like I'm feeling myself home so I went ahead and applied an accessibility health liquid lipstick and turn Hollywood this will be always one of my favorites I just love love love this lipstick so today I felt like whitening my teeth and today I'm using a new set which I haven't used before but on the first try my teeth were like two shades lighter so I do really like it so what I like to do is I like to apply it in the container and then I put it in my mouth for five to ten minutes so if I have to put on any jewelry which I do like my

and just how adorable is it it has a DNC for Dianna Chantal and actually have the necklace as well which is super pretty if you haven't seen it on my snapchat you go see it right now just go see it for my nails today I'm just going to remove my nail polish and I feel like this is just magic in a bottle it removes it super fast and I'm just going to go with something nude because that's what I'm feeling right now and this nail polish actually mentioned in my last video which if you haven't seen go see it because it's a fashionable and I really like it it's called topless and barefoot by Essie and then moving on to my outfit and of course McAvoy always has to be in the video my shoes are from Saks Fifth Avenue my skirt is from TJ Maxx and my top is from forever 21 I hope you guys enjoyed this video as always I love you all so much thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all very soon in my next video bye guyshi everyone so this tutorial is going to be how to recreate the look that Samina Gomez wore for her performance at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show you guys are always asking me if I will create some Selena Gomez makeup looks for you and I absolutely love the votes it the look that she wore for the fashion show it was a really warm bronzy smoky eye with glitter on it at least when the camera like pinned and on her it definitely looked like she had some chunky glitter going on so I definitely wanted to put that on the look too and she was wearing blue contacts which I think just kind of made her look a little bit different I'm wearing green contacts but because the both of us have really dark dark brown eyes I feel like the effect is still pretty similar even though hers were technically blue and wintergreen I think it still looks really similar and yeah so if you guys are interested in seeing how I recreated this look then please keep watching so I am starting off with eye primer I'm using lorac behind the scenes eyeshadow primer we're going to be priming our eyelids first because they're going to be working with glitter and you don't want that to fall onto your base taking this midtone pink called soulful from the egg cosmetics naturally pretty palette I'm working this into the crease of my eye with a fluffy blending brush this is going to be our transition shade it just gives a look a lot of overall warmth taking this gel liner from colour-pop in the shade sweet tooth I am taking my finger I'm just patting this onto my eyelids it is going to be a base for the next shadow that we use taking pokerface from makeup geek this is a pigment I picked this up on a flat shadow brush and patted this directly on top of sweet tooth and as you guys can see it just helps that pigment really stick and look even more metallic and Selena's shape of her shadow was a little bit catty so I am bringing this into the outer corner and it's not perfect but I'm giving it a little bit of sharpness on the edge like you guys can see I'm definitely giving it a caddy shape now for the glitter this is gorgeous Cosmetics glitter in the shade Oscar I picked this up directly on my fingertip with a little bit of duo eyelash glue and I just patted this directly onto my lid naina definitely had a little bit of chunky glitter going on and it looked so beautiful when it would flash in the lights and the camera was panned in closely to her eyes it just made her eyes sparkle it was so amazing to clean up fall out I took a Neutrogena makeup wipe and it picked up the glitter fine if you're having an extra hard time with the glitter that you are using then you can use some tape and that will just pick that up right off your face I'm priming my face with angel veil from NYX for my base I mix visa for illuminating drops in morning light with Dr Starr Foundation while I said that really good your star foundation and I applied this to my face with a flat top kabuki from hair and makeup addiction you taking Maybelline instant age rewind in the shades medium and newtralizer I am using my fingertips and I'm just applying this right under the eye to conceal and highlight and I put a little bit on the nose and keep it slow but I wanted to keep it overall true to the Victoria's Secret look because selena was definitely looking really natural and dewy so I wanted to keep the highlighting and contouring a little bit more light handed I set everything with the Kogan doe uh translucent light reflecting powder my fast she is I believe how you say it and I set the concealer foundation everything with this because like I said I didn't want the concealer to be too stark and highlighted and then I contoured my face just lightly with macchiato from Anastasia Beverly Hills contour where I typically do around the hairline under the cheekbones sides of the nose jawline you know the drill and to bronze my skin I'm taking the Lancome bronzer and just on a big fluffy brush this one is from Sedona lace I'm just lightly giving my face and overall more bronze appearance to fit the victoria secret super bronze look and then I took the poker face pigment from makeup geek once again on a luxe petit crease brush this one's from zoeva and I just smudge this into the lower lash line all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner and then I highlighted the face with champagne pop this is from Becca I picked this up on this tulip bulbs shaped brush from Sedona lace and like I said so you know wasn't super highlighted and contoured so I wanted this to just be really glowing from within eliminated looking so rather than really concentrating the highlight anywhere I worked it all over the whole face and then I was having a hard time my eyes were watering from the contacts but then I took this brown liner from Sigma in the shade balance and I work back into my waterline I'm going behind myself cool then I took the ICO fat liquid liner and I did thick dramatic wings because Selena had a very dramatic liquid cat eye going on I used Smashbox x-rated mascara on my top and bottom lashes I did do one coat of waterproof mascara but I'm doing the bulk of mascara with Smashbox x-rated this is sesame blush from gorgeous cosmetics I think this looks just like whatever saline I was wearing it's a very orange II terracotta warm blush so for lashes I used s kiddo desire I have one used so many times and I don't have the box anymore but I will link them down below if you guys they're very dramatic and she definitely had lots of lashes going on and then I just wiped my lip balm off with a makeup like to get started with a nice dry base and I am applying sore this is a Mac lip pencil and then just lightly outlining my lips for a little bit of definition or the color I am using hobbies like math for me I was running a light fleshie of kinky nude and I think this looks pretty similar to whatever she had going on her lips were very glossy and I used my favorite lip gloss of all time wedge Russian by buxom and then I finished everything off with a spray of Taco doing luminous skin miss my new absolute favorite that I've been talking to you guys about so much lately don't let me don't let me go don't let me go don't let me don't let me alright guys and this is the end result I hope that you found this tutorial helpful if you end up recreating this Selena Gomez inspired look then please tweet me

channel so today's video is going to be one of my most requested videos actually it is my top favorite best morphe brushes that I think are totally worth the money and which ones I think that you need to go out and buy just to have a good like set of morphe brushes not necessarily set but having your own like good amount of morphe brushes you know I'm saying this is the thing about working brushes they are all so cost-efficient amazing quality like frickin like Mac and Sigma status like quality and they're so so so so so cheap like they're so good dry brushes range from like 3 to like 7 bucks like they're just amazing and I've been getting so many requests because I use them all the time another great thing about working is I have a code with them it is the Commission code so I do make a small Commission if you guys use my code but you guys don't have to use my code if that's not your thing you guys don't like to do like no Commission thing or like buying things using codes and stuff like that then it's all good you don't have to do that I'm just saying you get 10% off if you use my code mani anyway in all caps 10% off the entire site so I think that's pretty good lying you guys it if you want I'm you don't have to if I can do it oh by the way if you don't like it we know we know the drill so we're going to put this up into two categories we're gonna do face ones I'm ready to I ones I'll leave both face I you want to get to them let's do face ones first cuz you're gonna take the longest are you fuckin first we're gonna talk about is my face foundation brush I use all the time if you guys see me doing a face tutorial with besides using like a Beauty Blender I'm using this brush this is the m43 9 basically what I love about this brush is that it's extremely extremely thick and dense and the applies foundation so beautifully it gives you a flawless finish and gives you more of like an airbrushed finish because it's so dense as you can see it's a very very dense foundation never gets down to here like ever ever we're just gonna do the bitch to clean it's a nice big brush it's great for my man face for me too like a brush that's a foundation brush with a kabuki brush I think this one is absolutely amazing obviously you have a smaller face than me you're gonna love it too but I'm just saying it works great with my big aunt thing it's perfect so for concealer I love this brush this is the m33 5 which is basically the small baby version of the last one I just talked about it is so adorable besides okay obviously what is it besides being adorable how you love to use this for concealer for the under-eye concealer to really blend out the excess product I don't need there honestly like I need to do is put a little bit by the eye doesn't it under that buff it out and this one does an amazing amazing job with it it's also a very dense brush and it's just it's small its tightening it's perfect it fits under the eye I think it's absolutely amazing it's a steal if you guys are into more like cream contouring and stuff it's fantastic at getting into the contours and the holes of the face and buffing out as well this is just a great buffing brush just like the other one is but a much smaller baby version of it so I know me okay let's talk about another one that I think is amazing for the under eye area this one is the morphe g2 which is basically like this tapered foundation brush is another very dense brush as you can tell I'm very much into buffing brushes as you can see what I like about the g2 so much is that it also takes away concealer beautifully you can apply concealer and you can take out we can see there so well with this brush but it's also great at highlighting I use this in my cream contour like review of the new Anastasio cream contour kits pretend this is the palette and I like that I applied I can use it from foundation you can use it for contouring I love that its taper at the end too so you can technically go in and contour with this or you can just use it for the under-eye concealing or highlighting or anything like that it's big enough where you get a good nice variety and you can get a larger conference at one time but it's not like two big words like like m4 3/9 definitely so on that so I think it's just a great brush you get a lot of control of this brush and it reminds me a lot of the Sigma tapered one which is a lot cheaper and a lot more just cost-efficient and I think it's great next one is gonna be the morphe g3 which is basically this doing so funny I was cracking up because like all my brushes that I'm like showing you guys are basically like dirty cuz I use them today to do my makeup and I was thinking oh my gosh I'd wash the brushes for them like I want anything about dirty bitch and I don't wash my brushes and stuff yeah but then I thought you know what like obviously I'm got tougher brushes that I use all the time why not just show them dirty like so you guys to know that I do use them all the time I do some today so okay sorry if you're not into that dirty shit but I am basically this brush is meant for cream contouring or powder contouring basically which every um I love about it is that it's such a dense also type of kabuki brush but the paddle is flat as you can see it's a completely flat brush and it's so amazing at getting into the hall the face and buffing in cream or liquid or powder anything like that it's so good at buffing out like a contour highlight or anything like that this one is one of my top favorite brushes I use one nearly every day every single time I use my makeup I use this one because I love it for contouring it's so good it just it's right amount of denseness it picks up product and beautifully it buffs up product beautifully it is so worth the money I love the the gunmetal series is one my favorite for more for you the good metals are just so good they're so good I love love love it now we're gonna talk about the m4 38 this brush I use literally in like I think every single tutorial I've done like a face thing I've used this brush this brush is my life so what I love about this one is that I use it for the under eye setting this brush is so pretty because it's so long it's perfect I getting underneath the eye my gosh it okay like this is the perfect under eye setting brush it's so soft it's dense enough where it picks up product beautifully and a lay style product really nicely as well and it doesn't put down too much I love to like go in with a powder get it with the powder and just kind of run it in there and dust off the excess off using my ring and then just kind of go in and set my under eye with it this brush is absolutely amazing this is just like it's one of my favorite brushes I've ever gotten from more feet ever ever I use it all the time beautiful at setting under eye makeup concealer anything like a nice one to my face once the next special mint aqua is the g8 brush this one I love love-love-love because it's also a flat brush very similar to the other one though talking about the contouring one but it's like a flat and it's tapered at the end I personally use those from blush all the time it gets tapered off on the sides out if you guys can tell but the way that bristles are cut it gives you a nice paper but they're extremely soft so if you want to go in would stick a little bit of blush you can just go on the tip and blend in and if you want to go in with a lot you can just press the whole brush into the blush and just go ham go ahead with that blush dude it's amazing it's amazing it's amazing amazing it's amazing it's all me scene and the last face we're gonna talk about is the morphe g7 basically just your everyday powder brush the reason I love this powder brush is that it's so thick I use this for bronzer I use this for powder raises for anything to do with powdering like my neck powdering my face and you can do with it I use this it's dense enough but it's not too dense where you lay down a shit out of powder and you look cakey so that's why I love this one so so so much it just gives you such a wide circumference like okay how it looks on my face it covers a good amount you know I mean so I go in with the bronzer on here not really just kind of dust in the bronzer into my face if I just want to go with Mormon bronzy look and same with powder I'll just kind of go down my neck just to kind of match it with my face a little bit I think that this brush is amazing if you're looking for a good powder brush that is high-quality that's not gonna pick up too much powder but it's gonna lay a good amount down try the g-seven it's amazing it's so amazing forgive that it's dirty I used it today obviously so now we're gonna go ahead move on to the eye brushes this is the eyebrows portion I have five brushes in the eye brush section as to me having seven in the face ones but I think a good couple high brushes will take you so so so so so far so far so damn far so we're going to start from the smallest to the biggest this one they just launched I just got it literally yesterday and it's the morphe M 508 which is this tiny um I'd use it today it's seriously like this brush is like revolutionary for me this one is so amazing at getting underneath your under eye area because it's so so so freaking tiny goanna getting underneath the lash line that's what I use it for I think this is amazing if you're into putting shadow underneath your eye and underneath your lashes this brush is so crucial it's not too stiff where you pick up so much product and you deposit so much product but it since it's so tiny it's amazing and getting underneath the lashes and really kind of buffing out the product thing it's literally like four bucks I honestly I don't know how morphe you guys I don't know how they forget survive I don't know how they do it I really don't amazing brush it's amazing let's go ahead and move on to the next one we're gonna go ahead and talk about the morphe 320 brush which is this this flat brush this brush is crucial for people and the reason I think it's cause I have three of Emily and I'm getting a three this brush is an amazing flat dense packing brush I use this with loose pigment uses with eyeshadow I use this with glitter ie you can use this brush with anything because it's so dense picks up product amazingly ended posits amazingly since and synthetic it doesn't like Harbert and your product in the brush I use this today to apply like my lid color that's why it's dirty fact that is pointed you have so much control and you can like really get up to that crease like where you want it to stop already wanting to keep going everyone needs a good packing brush especially one that's really dense I think the 320 is amazing for that okay cool next brushes let's go ahead and do the next one this one is the M for three three you guys know I use this in literally every single tutorial since I've got it it is basically the equivalent of a Mac 217 or Sigma e25 I think this one is just as good and it's literally like $5.99 I think or six bucks it's a white go hairbrush do you guys are interested in like did Mac 217 or Sigma e25 try this one out first if you guys like it I think the m4 33 is a main zing so worth the price likes okay two more I remember them the morphe M 505 which they just launched this one is I love this one so much I just got yesterday till I just until time this one is basically a tapered blending brush it reminds me very much of the Sigma e-40 but a tapered version of it what I love on spur so much is that it's so amazed at literally getting in to like the crevice of your eye depositing color and blending it out right then in there I was waiting for more food creative brush that's very very very very soft pointed and it's great at getting in the crease of your eye amazing a buffing amazing at blending amazing at depositing color this special is just mom it's so bomb look how cute it is I'm getting me fucking adorable last but not least darling last not least the morphe m4 for one with basically a large fluffy version of the m4 three three this is a great fluffy brush just applying any kind of shadow into the crease or if you want to do like a whole lid color this is just a great fluffy brush that I think is just one of those crucial fluffy brushes it's like the Sigma e-40 just the white go here version of it very soft bomb.com so yes that was it for my favorite morphe brushes I've been getting so many requests to make this video

she looks amazing I'm just gonna show you this right here she looks amazing and I've been wanting to do this since last year and I'm finally getting around to it because I was always so scared because of this lip it is a dark blue super pretty color also I got a new ring light if you guys can't tell and I also got a backdrop and just let me know how you're liking all of this and I'm also going to be getting a new lens and everything is just going to be focused on me and everything's going to be blurred out in the back and just gonna look so so pretty and I don't know I'm just very excited about this as you guys can tell enough about my new setup I just wanted to show you guys how to do this makeup look and I know this isn't my usual look like I never wear jeans stuff I never put my hair up in a bun I never wear hoops and I don't usually have a nose ring but I just thought if I'm gonna be doing Kolani look I might as well try to look like her a little bit I hope you guys enjoy and let's get into the video first and I start off with a primer and I'm going to be using the Porefessional by benefit I'm just taking a dime size like this and I'm putting it on the places where I would usually be able to see lots of my pores and for my foundation I'm going to be taking the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless foundation this one is in the shade 120 classic ivory so if you guys have stick around before and seen my previous video so you guys would know that I love using the Beauty Blender but I decided hey it's scene I gotta expand my brush use so today I'm actually using a brush which is like surprising Wow but I'm just lightly dabbing my foundation all over my face and then on my forehead nose and sighs my face of course and especially on these blemishes and I'm just saying some on my neck too because my neck is always a different shade and then with the X's on my hand just going to be dabbing it on my brush it was really this pale this doesn't even match me okay this is seriously the lightest foundation I have and we're just gonna have to work with it I know it's not very even but it's gonna work so I'm just going to be dabbing my master conceal by Maybelline New York concealer on my under eyes and on all my problem areas blemishes runny nose and on my chin a little bit like a rubber mouth because I've been getting pimples around there and not to set all I'm going to be using my la girl pro powder for today's eyebrows I'm going to be using my eight cosmetics brow power Universal brow pencil but Kalani's eyebrows were a little bit darker and I feel like I can get away with darker brows today because I have my roots growing in so you can't it shouldn't really matter so first I'm to be taking the other side with the spoolie and just combing them out to prep them for the collar and now I'm going back in with my spoolie side and just fading out the front and just blending out the rest so not to clean up the brow so I'll be taking my billion dollar brows pencil and I'm going to be taking the highlighted shade and just line my rows and then to blend this out I'm going to be taking my two-in-one brow brush by billion dollar brows and I'm going to be taking this orange side here and then just going to be feathering it away okay so now moving on to the eyes I'm going to be using my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion first I'm going to be taking a fluffy brush like this and I'm going to be taking this palette that you can find on Amazon transition shade I'm going to be taking this light brown here and I'm just going to be making sure that my crease is nice and warmed up and I'm going to be taking this a little bit above the crease but also inside the crease so it's going to be kind of like a two-in-one I would say more of the product and then I would kind of like feather it onto the outside so I get a little bit more smoky and darker so it just looks like there's a lot more dimension into that and just so that I doesn't look too naked I'm going to be taking that same brown shade and I'm just going to be running it on my lower lash lines till the two colors I'm going to be using this palette is the two lightest shades here and I'm going to be using this one and this one is kind of like a peachy nude II type of eyelid so I'm going to be taking it on a eyes shadow brush and just basically packing it on to my eyelid and I'm just going to tone down the peach enos with this white shade here and it's not very pigmented so if you do have a white that's very primitive then just take one tap and that's it because we just want a slight type of film to cover the peach enos of the eye shadow and then we're going to go back in with the same fluffy brush and I'm just going to be taking the brown right next to the brown that we use in the beginning and this is more of like an ashy type of brown coat with the ashy shade I'm going to be taking it into my crease and making a little bit more definition just so it looks like we actually have a crease and then with the excess I'm going to be feathering it out onto the outside and just to even out the bottom color on the lower lash line I'm going to be taking that same ashy Brown and also running it on the lower lash line and after the brow bone I'm going to taking that same white that we used earlier just dipping it into my brush and doing some highlighting under the brow bone she also has a little bit of a highlight into her inner corner so I'm going to be taking that same white and just dabbing it into the inner corner so I just think that the highlighting on the brow bone and in the inner corner just made everything come together and it's much nicer also in the picture she had a simple line of eyeliner so I'm going to be using my the balm Schwing liquid liner and I think this is amazing because it dries matte and it's very easy to apply so basically this is just a straightforward line and she has kind like a look at the end but I'm really scared to try that because the flicks never turn out the same and now for falsies I'm going to be taking my red cherry number 82 - mascara I'm going to be using my it cosmetics hello lashes mascara this is amazing I use it in so many my make its tutorial sometimes blending my falsies and my real eyelashes together so first I'm going to bronze my face with a hula benefit bronzer so in the picture she was super super bronze stuff like here into her cheekbone area and also like here on her temples and in the picture she really didn't wear any blush so what I'm gonna be doing is while I'm bronzing my face I'm also going to be using this bronzer as my cheek color put a little fluffy brush I'm gonna be dipping it into my cool bronzer and just slimming out sides of my nose look at that nose contour oh my god so now I'm going to be doing a little bit of more contouring because what I was doing before was bronzing so I'm going to be taking this little brush here and I'm just going to be dipping it into this thank you this brush is really going to help me get a nice like clean very deepening type of contour so now my most favorite part I'm getting like chills just thinking about highlighting using the famous famous Becca champagne pop can we just take a moment to talk about that guys champagne pop so I'm going to be taking a small little brush like this dipping it into my beautiful Highland I'm going to be placing it right here this seriously changed the highlight game so now I'm going to be taking some on the tip of my nose of course you guys know I'm overdoing that then also I feel like she had a little bit of highlight on the very very points of her brow bone that that is highlight guys hold on gun season in Aspen what she was wearing this really beautiful blue lip color that really made me want to create this look I didn't have any blue lip liners so of course I'm going to be using a dark purple lip liner and I'm just going to be laying my lips with it and I'm filling in my lips with the Le girl matte flat velvet lipstick and this is in the shade Blue Valentine so now I'm going to be taking my la girl lip stick and just filling in the rest so that is all for this makeup look I love how it turned out like it is just so glowy so bronzy and then here you are with like this bold dark blue lip I've never done this before so I hope that you guys actually enjoy that I'm using a little bit more color and just kind of stepping out of my comfort zone but I forgot one thing she was actually wearing a nose ring so let's just let's just do it for the look in my kalani did i just i transform enter so again thank you guys so much for watching me do this very out-there type of look I hope they guys enjoyed it and leave me any requests that you

her hair I'm working with the new me to show you how to get these big waves I'm using the lustrous set from new Muse holiday catalog and this comes with the lustrum uhm curling iron set so it has all these different barrels and the one that I'm going to use there's the really big one if you have long hair I would recommend using that one for this look but since my hair shorter I'm going to use the one down from that which actually I realized I couldn't use um the big one for this but I decided to do this one I you can use the glove if you want but I decided not to I'm just gonna be a little

products they're just amazing and this is basically the only stuff that I use on my hair so I'm just gonna curl all the way around my head um just wrapping around the barrel away from my face and I'm using kind of small sections but you could have used bigger ones because I realized that for the fashion show they actually did a lot more wavy instead of curls this year so they're super tight now I'm just gonna brush them out and them look more wavy not tight curls so you should definitely check out this gift set I'll have a link down below because it's perfect to give for the holidays and there's also a lot of different deals and sets with new me so you can check those ones out too so this is the hair I'm just twisting it when you twist it and then see how I'm doing that it makes it look like bigger thicker waves and that's what we want so here is the hair and I thought the makeup was so awesome and I've been doing my foundation routine a little bit different so and then I'd show you how I do it all in one so I'm starting off with the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation and my Beauty Blender I'm obsessed with the Beauty Blender I don't know what I did without it it just blends so perfectly and gives such a natural look of your foundation while keeping the coverage that you want so it's perfect I'm just dabbing this all over my face and the foundation is really really amazing too I've been loving it um and I'm also going to press it over my eyelids because I don't like to use an extra eye primer I just use Foundation and concealer so I switch between the tart and Anastasia concealer because they're both really the same kind of coverage I think but I just got the Anastacio one and I'm loving it as you can tell like see how great that coverage is it's super brightening it's really easy to apply and it just immediately makes your face look so much more awake and bright so I really like that and I use my new blender too it is perfect it is a Holy Grail product um so the color I'm in in this concealer is the lightest one I think it's point five you know the struggle the struggle so I'm just putting this on my nose on my forehead and my chin underneath my eyes all places that I want to highlight my face because as you can tell it just really brightens it up and makes your face book makes it pop so I really really recommend this concealer I think it's amazing but also the Tarte one is really great too it gives a similar coverage but this one just I just did this one in the Top Pot way then i am using the laura mercier secret brightening powder and again on my Beauty Blender just tapping this underneath my eyes to set the concealer using a translucent and brightening powder will just keep it bright and you won't lose like the coverage you have underneath your eye so I'm just putting that everywhere that I put the concealer and over my eyelids too so I have a good base for my eyeshadows I'm gonna take a face powder on the rest of my face this one's a little bit darker this one's for Marc Jacobs I know I'm using like more higher-end stuff I'm sorry about that that's just like things I ended up using um right now for my foundation routine you can use any one that you want like you definitely don't need to be high-end I'm using a bronzer now and I'm just giving a soft kind of contour ah sometimes I do a really harsh ones but I thought the girls for the show had more of a softer contour it was still dramatic and names still contoured but not like a straight line um and it just like immediately gives that slimmed-down face as you can tell on the other side so I'm just blending blending blending I'm using the Anastasia contour palette and also blend it down your neck so it all matches now I'm contouring my nose and I'm not great at this um it's a work in progress I'm working on it so I don't think I did a very good job but I have to practice to get there I'm just using the same bronzer I used and putting this on my nose I'm trying to figure out what kind of contour works best with the shape of my nose um but yeah just trying to contour that and then I'm gonna blend it out once I have it in the place that I like just with like the big fluffy brush I'm just gonna blend it all out so it's not just straight dark lines on my nose because that would not look right now for the highlight this is a Nastasia two and I'm just applying this to my cheek bone I'm using this tiny roll brush which I think a bigger brush it's a little bit better but this is what I had with me and it still worked so I'm applying this underneath my brow and on my nose I really like a super highlight and knows to I don't know I just think it's cute um putting it on my Cupid's bow on the other side also above my eyebrow I just like to highlight like crazy I love the glowing look and I thought the girls had that too I'm also putting it on my inner corner because I noticed that their makeup was super bright in the inner corner to just like shimmery and natural I'm also putting it on my lower lashline to brighten even more we just really want a bright and glowy look and face it so now I'm just blending everything out because there's a lot of different products on I want it to flow really naturally so I'm just blending blending blending then taking NARS orgasm blush I think this blush matches what they are wearing pretty close they had a lot of blush on so I'm really trying to pack this on to get the same effect and there is the foundation I've loved this routine I've been doing and it's so amazing I'm taking the Urban Decay all nighter spray and setting my face with that just gives the best dewy effect after it makes it look a little bit more natural and not cakey so that's great then I'm taking some eyeshadows to use for my brows I'm using eye shadows because I want it to be a little bit more natural I know that their eyebrows weren't like super defined and perfect so I was trying to do the same thing trying to keep them super natural filling them in on the end and then working in on the inner inner part of my eyebrow and then adding like little hairs as you can see how I'm doing right there with the brush so I couldn't make them very even but I was just trying to keep them as natural as possible not like super defined so you can watch what I'm doing um and as I'm watching it looks like your girl needs to get your eyebrows done I didn't even notice that but this HD camera is really showing me that it's time um so I was filling those in and you got to work with it you know I just wanted to give them natural so that's what I did with that and voila now I'm taking the taupe color from my lorac Pro palette and applying this in my crease I'm not focusing on the outer corner at all I noticed that that's how their crease colors looked so I decided to do the same thing and I'm also applying it on my lower lashline to balance it out and give a little smokiness underneath but still keeping it super natural because this is a pretty light color then I'm taking the lenses from Maybelline of just a pencil eyeliner and I'm going to line my upper lash line because it was more soft it wasn't like a felt tip or the liquid eyeliner that they use and I'm also not going to wing it at all which is what I normally do I'm just putting on a lash line and actually I do try to wing it a tiny bit just a mini mini mini wing like that just to kind of pull out the eyes a little bit more and I'm going to do the same thing on the other eye yes it's only Holi you can't forget curling your eyelashes so I'm just gonna do that I like to kind of pump it a little bit so it gives the best curl then I'm using the Tarte lights camera lashes and mascara and this one's amazing it gives you the kind of false eyelash look without having to apply them so I've been using this one a lot lately and I'm also applying it to my lower lashes just a little bit I'm not going super crazy and then that is the eye look for my lips I'm using pure Hollywood from Anastacio it's a liquid lipstick they had a kind of like peachy pink color so this is what I decided to go with and just because this is new I really wanted to use it that's why I used it and that's the look I'm totally obsessed with it I think it's super natural and pretty um and it just like highlights the best features you know if you trust out make sure to send me a picture and thanks for watching bye guys mmmhey everyone I missed you guys so so so much because I have not sat down and from the video in the longest time and wow this past month so much has happened and I this month was so crazy to me and I don't know what like I don't even know where to begin to explain myself where I have been about firstly I just want to mention two things thank you so much for the 100,000 subscribers on my channel oh my gosh I just cannot believe it because I never in a million years have thought I would reach 100,000 subscribers like this fad I just feel so incredibly lucky to just reach such a big milestone because I don't know like I started off filming with my iPhone I started this channel the reason I've been gone for so long is because the beginning of December I went to Hawaii for ten days and I didn't vlog a little bit so I'll probably put up a mini video and just like post it on youtube if you guys want to see it I don't know but that was honestly one of the best experiences of my life the main reason why I did not upload a video is because my camera broke my camera broke the beginning of December and I tried to return it and the whole like Canon thing it was just such a hassle so I just send it over to Canon for them to fix it so that took a long time and I just got my camera back today I want to mention something really fast I have eyelash extensions on this is my second time getting them done the first time I went to all so long it was just like super last-minute I would trust a lot of they literally put like ten eyelashes on each eye oh yeah so then I went to professional lady and she got them she she did them for me so I had these for like a week already one week already and I still love them so much so I don't even wear makeup look I have been put a makeup in a long time falafels I want to do a baking tutorial because I just kind of want to put on makeup I'm just going to show you guys today how I do my foundation how I highlight and contour and I'm going to zoom you guys in so you guys can see a better view so I'm going to be starting out with clean skin and I'm one to use this facial spray with aloe and herbs and rosewater and is just gonna really help moisturize my skin and yeah it feels really refreshing so I'm just gonna spray that all over my face and then for the primer I'm gonna take the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer and that's the consistency of it and basically makes my face look very glowy and dewy and that's what I like to have since my skin is very dry especially in the winter time so I just used one pump of this and apply it all over my face anyways for my favorite part I'm taking Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick foundation and this is in the shade 118 and I absolutely love this foundation because it's a cream consistency but it gives me a dewy effect and if you are oily you can just set it with the translucent powder and you're good to go so I absolutely love this foundation so what I do is I just take this foundation and glide across my cheeks and the center of my face as well as the perimeters of my face and then I take this furless cosmetics brush and this is called see me - and what I do with this foundation is I just kind of buffed the makeup away in circular motions and I also press the product into my skin and push outwards I don't know if that makes sense but anyways this foundation has a medium to full coverage is definitely buildable and it's definitely dewy so if you have oily skin I'm not sure if you guys are going to like this product but definitely give it a try and set it with a mattifying powder if you guys do try it I love how this foundation comes and you stick form because it just makes it really easy to touch up throughout the day if you do need any touch-ups and the fact that it's a cream it just blends in with the rest of your makeup really flawlessly now this is a new product I've been testing out but this is the Becca under-eye corrector and basically apply this before your concealer and it's supposed to correct the darkness under your eyes and since I have a lot of darkness and pigmentation under my eyes I like to use this before my concealer so what I do is I just take a small amount on my ring finger and just Pat it right underneath where I have that blue grayish dark circles and as you guys can see it just really brightens up the under eye area and when I apply concealer we'll just you'll just have a lot more coverage and it just looks really nice so I just take a small amount and just pop that right underneath you don't want to apply too much because this product can increase so you just want to use a small amount and then let your concealer do the rest of the work so I'm basically going to be using the UH Nastasia cream contour kit in light today and this is my sister's but I've never used on myself before but I'm taking these two highlighting shades and I'm just applying it underneath my eyes in a triangle shape and I'm using a found any foundation brush this is synthetic so you just want to use very light strokes and you just want to spread this product evenly and try not to take up too much because this is a Korean product and it can look very heavy okay so now you wanna do the same exact thing to the other side okay because that would just look really weird if you didn't so okay I'm sorry for the moment I just had with my cousin but anyways I'm just applying the rest of the highlighter on my chin and my Cupid's bow just to help balance everything out and this will also help my upper lip look fuller and my chin look a little bit brighter as well and then just kind of cover up the darkness around my mouth that we all tend to have and then I'm taking the highlighter on my forehead as well because my Florida is a lot smaller and I like to brighten it up a bit and just add a little bit more highlight on the corners of my mouth okay now I'm going to mix these two darker shades to bronze slash contra with and I don't know why I just tapped off the excess because it is a cream product but anyways I'm just so lightly dabbing from the product the temples by the way sorry my cousin we're gonna stop I am just placing this darker cream the perimeter of my face and then I'm also taking it through the hollow of my cheekbones and if you guys don't know where your cheekbone is it's the top of your ears to the corner of your mouth and you want to stop halfway so the line doesn't go all the way to the corner of your mouth because then that way you can look rain buddy and natural so you just kind of want to stop halfway and then I take this contour as you guys can see just bring it up a little because then it creates a much more slimming effect and decimal point of contouring was is to create illusions and it helps make your face appear a lot slimmer and that's exactly what I need because my face is a lot more of an oval shape and I like to have a lot of dimension and all that stuff going on and then you also want to apply some on the tip of your nose and the bottom of your lip and it's just really creates illusion of a fuller bottom lip and I'm taking my foundation brush and just kind of busting away the harsh edges I don't like a strong contour on my face shape so I just like to blend it out blend up edges a bit more just so it looks a little bit more natural so you want to grab your Beautyblender or any kind of sponge that you may have and I'm just pressing that onto my skin and just to help the makeup blend and the beauty blender also picks up any excess makeup that may be sitting on top of your skin so we prevents the cakey look so as you can see I'm just kind of going over my face and just making sure everything is nicely blended and I'm also making sure that the concealer did not crease so you wanted you just want to do that a couple times before you set your makeup so now I'm taking one of my favorite concealer this is the Maybelline age rewind concealer and light and what I'm gonna do with this concealer is just place place it right underneath my eyes where I need a bit more coverage and I'm not gonna use a lot of this because I did correct earlier and used honest thoughts with cream contour kit and I'm taking that same sponge and I'm just gonna Pat this underneath my eyes because I did not want to disturb the highlighting shades and the corrector so you just want to Pat this just to get the most coverage and so just everything stays in place and then I just go over everything one last time before I set it and then I'm using the banana luxury powder and cameo and this is one of I actually like this a lot better than the Laura Mercier powder and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bake my concealer and I'm just pressing that Beauty Blender into the powder and then I'm just gonna dab the powder right underneath my eyes and I'm just gonna let this powder sit like for two to three minutes actually and what its gonna do is it's just gonna really set that concealer and that makeup and it's gonna help the makeup lasts a lot longer throughout the day so you just want to apply this through the areas where you highlighted so I'm taking the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills contour kit and I'm taking that flan shade and the reason why I'm contouring after I'm baking is because I want my contour to look a lot more softer and I don't want it to be a harsh line so as I am contouring I'm also buffing away the product that I used to set my makeup so you guys are gonna see it right here really quick so as you can see I'm just dusting away the powder as I go I find it a lot more natural-looking if you do it this way but it's definitely up to you guys how you like your contract you like it to be more natural or stronger so I'm taking the Real Techniques setting brush and I'm just dusting away the powder that is underneath wise the reason why I'm using a new powder brush is because I don't want the contouring shades like the fawn that we used earlier to really mix it with the powder that we used underneath our eyes and I don't want the color to change so you just want to make sure you use a clean a brush for this step then I'm taking benefit hoola bronzer this is my second box already and this is honestly one of my favorite bronzers ever and I'm just gonna contour with this now so what I'm doing is I'm just using your brush in circular motions and blending and the product up as I go and then you also want to get your jawline and the temples just so everything ties in nicely together now I'm just taking the foundation brush we used earlier and I'm just patting over the edges of my bronzer just to help minimize any harsh lines streakiness and also helps the bronzer blend in with my skin a lot easier now for my blush I'm taking NARS orgasm and a small duo fiber brush and I'm just gonna use circular motions and blunt upwards just to get a nice wash of color so basically I'm just doing the kissy face and where you see your cheekbones pop out that's where you want to apply your blush and now I'm just casually gonna open my mouth and just apply my girls no you cannot have your mouth closed and apply your lower lash mascara now I'm just taking mag soft and gentle highlighter and makeup addiction cosmetics precision highlighting brush and we're just going to highlight our cheekbones our brow bone our nose and our Cupid's bow and you want to pack this highlight on I usually always switch out my highlighters but recently I've just really been loving back soft and gentle I don't because since ever since I've got a tan I just feel like it's been showing up on my skin tone a lot more so I like to use it while I can so you can obviously use any kind of highlighter you guys prefer and then to finish off this look I'm just taking a pistachio Beverly Hills liquid lipstick and pure Hollywood this is just my favorite go-to nude lipstick and I just like to use it when I do not know what to wear on my lips and I just go for this one cuz it lasts long all day and after I'm done with my makeup I'm just gonna spray my skin one last time and that is the completed look thank you guys so much for watching bye guys[Music] my first step to achieve glow dopes skin is the makeup primer spray from Scandinavia and this is just a vitamin based primer I also put it on my lips to moisturize them after I've applied my primer I'm applying my foundation this is the invisibly foundation in shade 300 which is solely designed for yellow olive skin tones and now I'm just taking my Stila contour duo palette kit whatever you wanna call it I'm just contouring my cheeks I just take my brush and do round strokes on my cheekbone to just define them and also I'm going to be doing a few dots on my forehead just to minimize the size of my alien five head and then after I've done that I'm just going to take two lines and draw them straight down the sides of my nose to slim my nose a little bit and now we're just going to blend it out blending is so important when it comes to contouring you don't want to have like dots or lines or anything leaving you looking like a Neapolitan ice cream so now we're going to take the highlight from the contour kit and just apply it underneath our eyes I'm using this one as a concealer because it's more lightweight than any other concealer I've had and then as well I just take it down the bridge of my nose now I'm taking the Kevyn Aucoin contour kit and I'm just setting all my contour my cream contouring stone or just setting it so stay for the whole day and I'm basically just doing the same thing but it's just with the powder what I like about the primer so much is that it's so lightweight and silicone free so doesn't it feel like I'm putting makeup on top of makeup it literally feels like I'm putting makeup on top of like the baby's butt skin like it's just so smooth and it keeps my makeup on for a very long time a lot of my primers have been very greasy and I guess it's from the silicone and it kind of like runs off my face but with this primer I've noticed that it stays on for almost like I think like 12 to 14 hours I would say it would stay on for that long if you use the primer and the finishing spray so it really does help a lot especially with my redness and then also with my pores it minimizes as well so I highly suggest you guys this primer if you're looking for a nice slick on free lightweight primer so once you have contoured with the powder just go ahead and blend this all the way out you don't want any lines or anything showing that even contouring [Music] now I'm just going to warming up my face I look a little dry a little gray so I'm taking this contour or bronzer palette from the beauty supply store and just applying it on my cheeks on my forehead and anywhere I feel like it's kind of pale [Music] [Music] you [Music] and now I'm taking this NARS blush and g-spot and I'm just dotting it on my cheeks to give me kind of like a cuter more innocent look I don't know I just love blushes and this blush is like the perfect blush with my complexion so I'm just applying it onto my cheeks and I'm going to take my Beauty Blender and blend it all out [Music] [Music] so I've always had a problem with having like ashy eyebrows so I'm taking the Scandinavian makeup primer spray I'm just spraying on a brush and I'm gonna like kind of like take the excess makeup off of my eyeball so they don't look kind of ashy after I fill them in and stuff after I have kind of taken away the ash I am using Anastasia Beverly Hills eyebrow pencil and just filling in my eyebrows ever so slightly and after I filled them in I take the interstage Beverly Hills brow gel and just kind of comb them into place [Music] once I finished my eyebrows I'm taking Nyx's lipliner and coffee and I'm just lining my lips this is my favorite lipliner I've been using it for months and months and months and I just find it very like a natural Brown so after I've lined my lips I'm just going to take it like smear it all over my lip so I can get like a full color and after I've used coffee I use Nyx's ever and just apply it in the center of my lips and now I'm just going to get to highlighting this is benefits high-beam and I just take this one and I blend it out with my Beauty Blender this is just like the base for my highlight it's a very liquidy highlighter so I wouldn't recommend using it on its own unless you like very very very dewy looking skin but this is just my initial highlighter and once I have blended out the high-beam highlighter I'm going to take Becca's champagne pop every girl on the planet should own this highlighter it's amazing and I'm just gonna put it on to my cheekbones just to kind of set that previous highlighter and stone and also just like up the ante for my highlighter like this is some crazy highlighting going on right now I know I'm saying so crazy now I'm sure a lot of you girls who do makeup know that spraying your brushes with a primer or water will obviously heighten the pigment of the highlighter or any eyeshadow or anything so I just sprayed the Scandanavia primer spray onto a brush and I'm using it now to kind of highlight those key points which are my corners of my eyes my brow bone tip of my nose and the bridge of my nose so now I'm just using up my wet brush and applying the highlighter also make sure to highlight your Cupid's bow and the top part of your lip this just accentuates the shape of your lip I guess for me it just makes everything look so glowy and beautiful so I will just do it now blend it out because you don't want it to look too like bam bam bam you want it to be like a subtle BAM so just blend it out and now I'm just going to wing my eyeliner what kind of like a opposite of a wing it's like a downwards winged eyeliner it's like a depressed eyeliner so just go ahead and angle it downwards this helps with making my eyes look bigger I've noticed so this is good for people who might have small eyes like myself [Music] [Music] once I finished lining my eyes I'm taking my go-to lashes the ardell demi wispies and I'm just applying them I've tried millions of lashes like I love lashes and these are the best lashes that I've ever used so if you're looking for a go-to lash I would do the ardell demi whispies and know this is not a promotion for them I'm just being honest now I'm just taking a black mascara and I'm just applying it to my natural lashes just so it blends with the false lashes and now I'm just going to set my face with the Scandinavian makeup setting spray and this is just going to keep it in place for the whole day I also apply to a q-tip and then I take my q-tip the wet q-tip and take the Becca highlighter and apply it underneath my eyes to make my eyes look more innocent looking it's like a Korean makeup tip that I picked up so I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I will list all the products below now these are just some scenes of me feeling myself and being conceited and fixing my hair you guys know the usual but I hope you guys kind of got the gist of it this is how I do my makeup everyday I love very glowy makeup so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll be back soon with another video for you guys love you so much thank you for watchingtake your phone Alicia hiding in your package until you get home hey guys it's like that so today I'm doing a Kalani inspiring tutorial and I saw this picture that just blew my mind and she looks amazing I'm just gonna show you this right here she looks amazing and I've been wanting to do this since last year and I'm finally getting around to it because I was always so scared because of this lip it is a dark blue super pretty color also I got a new ring light if you guys can't tell and I also got a backdrop and just let me know how you're liking all of this and I'm also going to be getting a new lens and everything is just going to be focused on me and everything's going to be blurred out in the back and just gonna look so so pretty and I don't know I'm just very excited about this as you guys can tell enough about my new setup I just wanted to show you guys how to do this makeup look and I know this isn't my usual look like I never wear jeans stuff I never put my hair up in a bun I never wear hoops and I don't usually have a nose ring but I just thought if I'm gonna be doing Kolani look I might as well try to look like her a little bit I hope you guys enjoy and let's get into the video first and I start off with a primer and I'm going to be using the Porefessional by benefit I'm just taking a dime size like this and I'm putting it on the places where I would usually be able to see lots of my pores and for my foundation I'm going to be taking the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless foundation this one is in the shade 120 classic ivory so if you guys have stick around before and seen my previous video so you guys would know that I love using the Beauty Blender but I decided hey it's scene I gotta expand my brush use so today I'm actually using a brush which is like surprising Wow but I'm just lightly dabbing my foundation all over my face and then on my forehead nose and sighs my face of course and especially on these blemishes and I'm just saying some on my neck too because my neck is always a different shade and then with the X's on my hand just going to be dabbing it on my brush it was really this pale this doesn't even match me okay this is seriously the lightest foundation I have and we're just gonna have to work with it I know it's not very even but it's gonna work so I'm just going to be dabbing my master conceal by Maybelline New York concealer on my under eyes and on all my problem areas blemishes runny nose and on my chin a little bit like a rubber mouth because I've been getting pimples around there and not to set all I'm going to be using my la girl pro powder for today's eyebrows I'm going to be using my eight cosmetics brow power Universal brow pencil but Kalani's eyebrows were a little bit darker and I feel like I can get away with darker brows today because I have my roots growing in so you can't it shouldn't really matter so first I'm to be taking the other side with the spoolie and just combing them out to prep them for the collar and now I'm going back in with my spoolie side and just fading out the front and just blending out the rest so not to clean up the brow so I'll be taking my billion dollar brows pencil and I'm going to be taking the highlighted shade and just line my rows and then to blend this out I'm going to be taking my two-in-one brow brush by billion dollar brows and I'm going to be taking this orange side here and then just going to be feathering it away okay so now moving on to the eyes I'm going to be using my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion first I'm going to be taking a fluffy brush like this and I'm going to be taking this palette that you can find on Amazon transition shade I'm going to be taking this light brown here and I'm just going to be making sure that my crease is nice and warmed up and I'm going to be taking this a little bit above the crease but also inside the crease so it's going to be kind of like a two-in-one I would say more of the product and then I would kind of like feather it onto the outside so I get a little bit more smoky and darker so it just looks like there's a lot more dimension into that and just so that I doesn't look too naked I'm going to be taking that same brown shade and I'm just going to be running it on my lower lash lines till the two colors I'm going to be using this palette is the two lightest shades here and I'm going to be using this one and this one is kind of like a peachy nude II type of eyelid so I'm going to be taking it on a eyes shadow brush and just basically packing it on to my eyelid and I'm just going to tone down the peach enos with this white shade here and it's not very pigmented so if you do have a white that's very primitive then just take one tap and that's it because we just want a slight type of film to cover the peach enos of the eye shadow and then we're going to go back in with the same fluffy brush and I'm just going to be taking the brown right next to the brown that we use in the beginning and this is more of like an ashy type of brown coat with the ashy shade I'm going to be taking it into my crease and making a little bit more definition just so it looks like we actually have a crease and then with the excess I'm going to be feathering it out onto the outside and just to even out the bottom color on the lower lash line I'm going to be taking that same ashy Brown and also running it on the lower lash line and after the brow bone I'm going to taking that same white that we used earlier just dipping it into my brush and doing some highlighting under the brow bone she also has a little bit of a highlight into her inner corner so I'm going to be taking that same white and just dabbing it into the inner corner so I just think that the highlighting on the brow bone and in the inner corner just made everything come together and it's much nicer also in the picture she had a simple line of eyeliner so I'm going to be using my the balm Schwing liquid liner and I think this is amazing because it dries matte and it's very easy to apply so basically this is just a straightforward line and she has kind like a look at the end but I'm really scared to try that because the flicks never turn out the same and now for falsies I'm going to be taking my red cherry number 82 - mascara I'm going to be using my it cosmetics hello lashes mascara this is amazing I use it in so many my make its tutorial sometimes blending my falsies and my real eyelashes together so first I'm going to bronze my face

lot to me ah okay so I will talk to you guys in my next video I'll do all so much byehey guys and welcome back to my channel today's makeup tutorial is going to be on how to achieve this soft full neutral makeup look to get started I'm gonna be applying my matte natural radiance primer all over my skin before we apply foundation this will just hydrate my face and also just prep it so my foundation goes on smoothly and then I'm taking my ax1 invisi wear foundation and just applying it all over my skin and just kind of dotting it everywhere and then I'm going to be blending that into my complexion with the Real Techniques sculpting brush and I'm just kind of going in circular motions and Cyborg motions just to kind of buff this into the skin and I want to kind of get the most even layer as possible because we are going to be applying concealer so we don't really need to apply a second layer of this so one layer will be just fine and just making sure that the whole of my face is covered because this is a darker color than my face because it matches my neck so just make sure that it's all blended in I have gone ahead and filled in my brows off-camera if you do want to see how I do fill in my brows I will pop a link in the description box for you so you can see how I do it next I'm just going to be taking my soft ochre Paint Pot and just applying this all over my eyelids to make sure that the eyeshadow I apply sticks and appears more vibrant then I'm taking the Too Faced chocolate bar palette and I'm gonna be starting off with this peachy brown shade and I'm going to use this as my first transition color I'm going to be taking this on a big fluffy blending brush and I'm just going to go side to side and make sure this is really well blended into the crease as always because this is my first transition shade you want to make sure this blends in really well to the rest of your eye that way all the other colors you apply will just blend it really really seamlessly so just blend it as much as you can then taking this milk chocolate shade I'm going to be applying this into the crease also I want to very seamlessly create a smokey effect I want it to be very soft so graduating into a darker color slowly that's the best way to create that effect so I'm just going to be applying this into the outer V increase area and then going back into that previous brush to make sure that it's really well blended into each other that way again there's no harsh lines and that smokiness is going to look really really effortless and just really well blended then I'm taking this warm brown shade and I'm going to be applying this into the outer corner also this will just prepare it for the darkest Brown we're going to apply and it just makes that dark brown blend a lot easier and it just gives that really nice airbrushed effect which is what we're going for with this look so just blend that as well as you can also and then we're going to go into the dark fudge color that's just right here and we're going to be applying that into the outer corner with a separate brush we want to keep this color as close to the crease as possible we're gonna take out too far because we are going to blend it out a little looks really seamless as you can see I'm just kind of going back and forth between brushes then I'm just taking a q-tip and just cleaning up the sides this will just make everything look a ton neater next I'm just going to be taking this cool brown shade and I'm just going to be applying it onto the center of my lid this will just kind of create that really nice shimmery effect I'm just taking this really nice peachy light shimmery shade and I'm just going to be applying that on the inner part that Brown we just applied will make it transition a lot nicer and it'll just make it look like it's just blending into the rest of the eye next I'm just going to apply some lashes these are the Vegas nail Iowa grand glamour lashes I absolutely love these these are so gorgeous and you just don't need to do anything and it just transforms the look into such a glamorous look so I'm just applying them with some tweezers and just making sure they're really well stuck on because I'm not applying any eyeliner you want to make sure they're stuck as close to the lash line as possible then I'm just taking some mascara and applying them to my natural lashes that way they blend into the false ones a lot better and you can't tell where your natural lashes start or finish next I'm going to start on my concealer I'm applying my Maybelline age rewind concealer underneath my eyes and I'm kind of taking in an upwards motion to give myself that really nice lifted effect I'm also applying some of this on my forehead down the bridge of my nose and also on my chin as always this will just highlight these areas and really bring them forward and this will just kind of stroke to your face really really well and to blend it into the rest of my complexion I'm going to be using it the Real Techniques sculpting brush again this is the same brush I used to apply my foundation and it just blends everything so flawlessly then I'm going in with my Sigma 3d HD precision brush you guys know I love this brush just to get into all the little areas that a larger brush cannot reach is the perfect shape my base always looks so flawless when I use this because it just gets into all those little areas then I'm going to be setting my under eyes with the soap &amp; Glory instant retouch powder and I'm taking it on a sigma f-35 brush and I'm just making sure to set all the areas where I applied my concealer that way it won't budge and it also will prevent shine also and then I'm just taking a larger brush and just applying it on the rest of the areas also just to make sure that everything is nice and set next taking a large shader brush I'm going to take some of that warm brown color onto the bottom lash line this is just going to create a really nice balanced effect from the top and the bottom lash line and to make it look a little bit smoky er I'm going to take that darkest Brown we applied and I'm going to apply that as close to the lash line as possible so as you can see I'm just kind of pressing it against the lash line and this will just kind of create a really subtle smoky effect without it being too much and then I'm taking this champagne color and I'm going to apply this on my inner corner as the highlight before that inner area and this will just make the eyes look so much brighter and it will just kind of finish off the look as well next I'm playing some nude eyeliner into the waterline this will again just make the eyes look larger more brighter and it just kind of makes it look a little bit softer then applying black if you were to apply a black it would look a lot heavier so this will just kind of give it that softer effect and then I'm just applying some mascara to my bottom lashes to balance the top and the bottom and that way the whole eye look is complete and then we are ready to move on to the bronzer to Brunn's my skin I'm gonna be using this shade from the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit in lights and I'm just going to use this on that big zueva brush I always love to use I simply love this brush and I'm just going to be bronzing all of my face because I just kind of feel like this look is quite neutral and I just want to make my face look nice and warm and because I'm gonna be applying blusher I like to wear bronzer and blush together because I just feel like it looks better on my complexion so I'm just kind of bronzing the perimeter of my face and then I'm gonna be going in with the form color from that contour kit also and I'm going to slightly contour the cheeks also and this will just kind of give my face a little bit more shape without it looking too harsh I love using this phone shade on the nose as well because it's cool and after contour but it is warm enough to look normal at the same time without looking too gray I'm just using a small blending brush to just go around the corners of my nose to make it look slimmer and then I'm taking this blusher from the balm and just applying it onto my cheeks you guys know I rarely wear blusher but I wanted to apply some because this is a full look and then I'm taking my Becca opal highlighter and just using this on the tops of my cheekbones to give us that glow I didn't want to apply too much of this and this just kind of gives us that champagne glow without being too gold or summer so you can still look glowing but you're not going to look as golden so also applying some of that on the tip of my nose and then I'm going to be moving on to my lips and firstly starting off with stone lip liner from Mac I'm just going to be running this along the outside of my lip bone and I'm just going to be using this to cool down the lips before I apply the next shade and then going to be applying a Rimmel lip liner I'm not actually sure the shade of this liner but as always everything will be down in the description box I just wanted to combine the two colors to create a really nice deep mode I didn't have a lipliner that would sort of match it so I just kind of created my own I love customizing lip liners I feel like you can create such a nice touch with that I don't even know how to explain this color but it's basically like a brownie pink mauve color this is one nine nine five from gerard cosmetics and i'm just going to be applying this all over the top just to warm it up a little bit i feel like this limp is perfect for the autumn but i did want it to be a little bit more matte so i did set my lips with some translucent powder this is the same pad i used to set my under eyes so guys this is the finished look I hope you guys enjoyed my first full tutorial of the season if you have any requests of autumn or food tutorials then please leave them down below don't forget to like this video if you enjoyed it and subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to also follow me on all social media I am on Twitter Facebook Instagram and snapchat or under makeup by Layla I hope you all have an amazing day and I will see you guys in my next video bye guyshi everyone welcome to my channel this is my first video and it's going to be about what my makeup looks like on a daily basis basically and yeah so hope you enjoy it okay so I've already washed my face with clean and clear daily face wash I think that's way cool and navy are to face some body moisturizer basically okay so once you your face is clean and moisturize what I usually do is go ahead and use a primer but I don't have any left unfortunately alone I use this from benefit to called pore fessional this is a good problem I'd recommend it um and yeah so first thing I like to do is put on my foundation and the one I use well the ones I use are Mac Studio sculpt in NC 30 and Rimmel wake me up in classic beige and why do is come on the back of my hand just a tiny bit literally like this much and then mix it with this one 1/2 a pump and some moisturizer because I find that if I just apply foundation straight onto my face it's a bit heavy and it's kind of cakey because I don't really have bad skin anyway and I don't really need to so let's pick some up about that much on the back of my hand and mix it together and once that's mixed I just use my finger and apply on my face okay once that's all on my face I use this Real Techniques sponge I don't know what this is called but yeah it's really good I love it I ditched everything and it is much cheaper than a beauty blender so why why not and why do you is I just dab up my makeup or for my for my foundation all over my face and once that is all on I just let my face sit for like ten seconds before I put on my concealer okay not that's done I go ahead and use my concealer and I use yes yeah Maybelline sorry packaging's come off but Maybelline Dream Lumi touch and I just apply that wait what color is this ivory yes apply that right onto my eyes in like a triangular sort of shape and I do use a lot of concealer and on the other eye down the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow and my chin and once again I use this sponge like the point yar and just to blend everything in then I just go ahead and use my Mac palette this is called Pro conceal and correct it's in medium deep i use this yellowy so it's shade here just apply a little bit under my eyes because I feel like this well this can see light it's a bit white and so I need to bring the warmth back to my face so I choose my finger time your belt in my eyes side and I feel like this just brightens up my eyes a little bit more - okay and once that is done I go ahead and bronze up my whole face and what I use for this is the bourgeois Paris bronzing powder that is what that looks like and this is in the shade 52 I just use a big fluffy fluffy brush this one's from eBay it came in like a pack of 16 like 10 pounds it's very very cheap and I still have them I've got them about four years ago I think actually really good so I do is to all my brush and runs are tap off any excess and just bronze or my whole face and bring it down to my neck look just so you're not like three different colors okay and once you have your desired darkness I guess what I do is go ahead and contour and for my contour i use the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit I love this it's actually amazing I use it for pretty much everything and the colors I use are is this middle gray Brown sort of color I really like this color because it's not as orange at the other two so it's more it looks more other shadow it is just a bit more natural and this darker Brown right underneath a highlighter shade and I use that with my Real Techniques setting brush I just mix those two colors together on my brush tap off any excess because they are very pigmented and just go right onto my cheek bone if you don't know where your cheekbone is just you can use your finger or a brush or whatever and there's like you feel like a hollow where it should be and that's where you want to contour some lines right here that's where I'm going to contour don't start contouring like right down your face because you have to have like a really obvious line and even if you bend at you it's just going to look crappy I'm just going to pick up my more products don't just slap a load on your face because you can't really work backwards so just start off small with small amounts and then just build off if you need to and I'll bring that up to my forehead a slightly I don't really need to call to my forehead because it's not really big I don't want it to look even smaller so I just tend to stay away from that this one muffled hood a little bit and then I bring it once again pick up more product on the excess and then just contour my jawline it seems sort of like a three shape if you don't really know where to contour do it in like a three and then just I just contour down line nose a little bit I'm just going to go ahead and do it on the other side okay so once your face is contoured how you want it I just go ahead and highlight my face and I use the hourglass highlights are in moonlight I this was literally the only highlighter found that doesn't have like bits of sparkle in it so it just kind of makes you glow into it I'm just shining if that makes sense so this is what that looks like and I use a fan brush also from Real Techniques I don't even tell but okay so I just take some of my brush once again tap of any excess and apply it just above my cheap on the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow and just on my chin so basically where you put your concealer just not on do you want your eyes if that makes sense you can put some just below your contour as well if you just wanted to make it stand out a little bit more so yeah that is what the height looks like okay so once you've done your highlight are I just go ahead and use my blusher and this one some golden rose it's in the number Oh - a lot of people have asked me what i use on my cheeks and is this so i just use this book is another brush will Murr Sal got from eBay and I just follow my lash on the blusher top of the neck dress and with this blusher you kind of half the top of the excess cause it's so pigmented and I apply that right where my contour is and on this side as well you don't need to pick up any more because it some people like to apply it here I find that putting it where my contour is just scoot my shape of my face better and it just looks nicer okay so once my face is done I go ahead and do my lashes um and I use two different mascaras I use lash sensational by Maybelline and Maybelline the falsies volume Express when it comes in scars I don't really waste my money on like Mac or benefit habla because I just feel like they work the same to be honest so there's claim and I use the lash sensational fast and I just kind of take off any excess just so it doesn't read clump up as much and then just apply that show it on to my lashes you can tell your lashes if you want what I just don't really need to ok so once my first layer of mascara is applied I go ahead I wait for it to just dry a little bit and then apply this one a lot of people do ask me on Instagram if I use fake lashes and what brand they are and blah blah blah blah that's all I don't really feel the need to use fake lashes because my lashes are long enough and the ridges really uncomfortable so once my mascara is applied I just go ahead and use my fingers to just rub off any excess on my eyebrows I don't really fill in my eyebrows on a daily basis because there's really no need to so once I done I just go ahead and just put a little bit of color on my lips than the one I'm using it's from Max Factor it is in the shade pink brandy eight to five and it's just sort of like a peachy color that's what that looks like I just dab it okay so once your makeup is finished and you're happy with what it looks like you can go ahead and say it you don't have to do this step it's just what I like to do because when I use powders and stuff I feel like it looks a little bit powdering I don't really like that look so I use the Mac prep and prime fix yet fix plus um I really like this I wouldn't use it if I had early skin because it does make you look a bit shiny that's what I like about it it just makes your face look washed rice and refreshed and stuff so what I do is I just spray that directly onto my face and you can spray how much you want to and I'm running out and just let that dry okay so this is what the final product looks like I hope you enjoyed if you have any video requests or any questions just give it down below and I'll see you in my next video like I would cut that it takes a while okay should I the end on it shows the different product please like and subscribe if you want to see more and you have any scores cancerhey guys it's Amanda I'm you Samuel make a by Samuel on Instagram so he did this whole glam look on me and it looks amazing so he's gonna show you how you can do this so we're putting on moisturizer and this moisturizer is by benefit and we're just gonna apply it with a brush all over her face wait for it to soak in yes how long does it take um I usually wait like 10 20 seconds I'll soak in real quick since I use a lot of powders I like to use a lot of moisturizer cuz at the end it ends up looking like skin and not like so much makes sense when I try to use powders underneath my eyes and like wherever I highlight yeah it's like really dry yeah so the foundation we're gonna be using is by Makeup Forever HD in 1:20 and I chose a color that's a little less lighter because I kind of want to give her a little tan and then later we're gonna blend it in with a Beauty Blender so Amanda actually has really great skin tan Hey has that anybody else for you to set I think in the first video that I've done like this oh also I mean I'm like done fun videos in the video okay so it's like yeah I'm gonna start blending blending is key so now we're just gonna close you a screw brush a little foundation your eyelids so how long does it take you to edit a video it depends on what kind of video if it's like one where I'm just sitting down talking that's it's like 30 minutes oh wow but if it's something like this will probably take a while yeah so the concealer I'm going to be using is by Dior and this is the Dior nude concealer and we're gonna start highlighting her face let's make sure you apply it really good and then a little on her lip on her chin Amanda honestly doesn't need this much makeup but this is glam so a while and then we're gonna go with our Beauty Blender and just blend now I like my Beauty Blender to be damn it helps with the blending to use your Beauty Blender wet or dry yeah I mean I use it wet when I'm blending but then I also use it dry for like powder and see I like it when it's wet for powder under the eyes yeah so just make sure you really blend everything I usually cream contour but on Amanda we're going to use a powder contour what's the difference with the effective well powder is going to give you more of a softer look versus cream that's going to give you more of a really contoured look so the powder I'm gonna be using is Laura Mercier and I'm just gonna set the under-eye area this is going to prevent it from creasing and also it's gonna act as a shield for when we do your eye shadow so I'm gonna take some of that powder and I'm just gonna lightly set it under her eyes we're just gonna softly blend it down what's your favorite sushi place no boom I love Nobu so now I'm gonna start studying her face and for that I'm gonna be using Laura Mercier translucent powder and then I powder I'm gonna get a little spun sugar this circle right and we're just gonna set under her cheekbone and what this is going to do it's going to help when we contour it's going to give her more of a defined cheek row I don't know lip highlight and then the rest of the face I'm going to set it with laura mercier so I'm going to take a studio gear brush and I'm just I put the laura mercier on my hands we're just gonna Pat it I did her makeup for the VMAs and we were there for a while but it looked really good after we're just gonna softly blend these lines as well so now we're gonna contour and that I will be using Milani Soleil number 5 I'm just gonna go lightly with it I'm gonna lightly contour so what I like about this bronzer is it has shimmer and it looks so beautiful when it's like photographed or whenever you're being filmed or just you know whenever you're outside it just hit the Sun hits it really nice or ahead a bit so sometimes I like for my clients to smile smile a bit so we're gonna make Amanda look like she just came back from the tropical island so now we are going to do her highlight and the highlights gonna be like the top of her cheekbone connecting to her brow bone and for that we're gonna use anastacio Beverly Hills star light illuminator it's my favorite oh I was just looking at that that I wanted to buy it so pretty so I just like blending it together with the contour so you guys can see it's like really highlighted so we're gonna start filling in her brows so you're gonna brush her brows up and we're gonna start filling it so I like more of a softer brow just going to brush it blend it really really really good after I'm going to get a little concealer the same concealer that I use we're going to clean it up same thing with the other eye and let so now we're going to move on to eyes so I'm going to be using a blush by anarse it's called orgasm right yeah so this is going to be your base I love using my blushes as eyeshadows sometimes the outcome it doesn't look like you have like blush on your eyes or anything like that so now I'm gonna use the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills Miami eye palette and I'm going to use this fresh peach color right here so the next color I'm going to use is by NARS it's called surabaya and I'm just going to take a flat brush and apply it to her lower lash line and we're going to blend the same palette we're going to use the second color other eye is the blender what I'm gonna do is I'm going to apply a highlight in the center of her eye right here and it's gonna be the same on associa Beverly Hills highlighter this is just gonna give her a pretty sheen when she closes her eyes so now to highlight in the inner corner of her eye we're going to use so Hollywood bionis hacia Beverly Hills so now we are gonna just do a few kiss softer colors under her eye and I'm gonna be using that same Anastacio palette and I'm gonna be using in caramel and Sienna mixed with a little bit of fresh peach I'm gonna take the same blush that I used on her eyelids and I'm just gonna softly smudge it under her eyes we're gonna move on to the eyelashes we are gonna curl your lashes this is my favorite mascara it's by L'Oreal carbon black what's your favorite mascara I really like the better than sex it's a good one I could coat the lashes really well so the eyelashes I'm going to be using today are Lily lashes the style is NYC they will like last you have to like 30 times yeah

this stuff so you're gonna let it soak in for a bit so we're done thanks for watching guys I don't knowhi everyone so I'm going to do a everyday tutorial makeup tutorial this is gonna be combat carve get really with me love what I basically do every day and this is like my go-to everyday so I wouldn't do this every single day but it's more like my everyday makeup when I want to be glam or like when I can't think I think I want to do on that day I'll let you just do this because easiest option it's so easy to do if you're wondering why I've got this bandage on my thumb in a tiny little horror story right now so basically I probably explain what happened but basically my thumbnail or my thumb obviously I've got fake nails on my thumbnail got taken off so the acrylic and it tip it took off the my real nail with it so basically I've basically just got raw skin underneath this is quite painful it's actually quite hard to do my makeup so if you know how I got this very simple look then you write on this on white eyebrows this is Mac eyebrow pencil in spite I'm gonna speed this it up just because I've got a full video of like how I do my eyebrows so if you want to know how I do my eyebrows in detail then I'll put a link in the description but I'm going to get money I move now for our brush by real techniques we've used to help I broke it I use about a bit and the elf has now been discontinued but I know that blows of places - like I broke it I know sneak comes with one for a good price but if not then just use a brown eyeshadow that complements your brows okay to conceal my brows I'm going to use my Mac Pro Longwear concealer with this I like to put it on one brow fast so I put it on and then I blend it as soon as I put it on this concealer tends to dry very very quickly and then it goes all orangie and stuff once it's just dried in place and it's just not you so I put it on blend it put on another area blend it you get I blend it with my Real Techniques crease brush deluxe crease brush so I just wear this cuz simple it just come down here I just drag it free middle every light this concealer the only thing I don't like is how much comes out of the pump like loads is on my hand and lows didn't need to be on my hand but there's no work really control okay then I do the cockpit so this probably a better browser never I mean is rare I get both of them or ordinate point then what I do is I get my Urban Decay primer potion well I also have to do is make sure concealer is here so whatever is remain on this brush that I use to blend out on my eyebrows and just put it here because I don't forget to put it there and then I take pictures and then there's like just anyway I'm going to use the find it at my Mac two to four brush today I'm going to use it is it with everything today we compute the post off noise okay today I'm going to use the Too Faced chocolate bar palette then dip it in the color milk chocolate and it's semi-sweet and this will go my quiz they're just going to use a flat eyeshadow brush and go with the color white chocolate which is this one and I'm going to pack this all over the lid vacuum with the two colors that we had before which is my chocolate and it's a sweet and go back in degrees okay that's that fire shadow right then I'm going to use my L'Oreal suite lineup I'm sure they've discontinued this so every time like I see like one like left to the shop and itchy just like fire bit this is my favorite ever I lied I don't know why they would ever just continue like you don't say hearts I am I've also I'm gonna speed this up as well but also those two little penis so that would be linked more so now there's a little bit mascara wrong okay I'll go flashing on these I normally use on a when I put makeup on I don't mean use ardell demi whispies that she's going to be using today I'm very easy as diaper twice so they're not as crushed as one it's me okay so I put my lashes on and I'm going with this drug before anything goes with my eyes then I'm going to start I'm going to put this Mac strobe cream on where I want to blue darling okay so I've been using em the new NARS foundation I love comfort I love it right this is the all day luminous weightless foundation I'm in circles or however you say it but this is what it looks like I really like this foundation it says you'll need one pump to like have a full face coverage but I am a full face junkie even though I don't need it but I love like really full face so I use like two and a half pumps but you could use you could easily get away with one or two using my Real Techniques buffing brush I'm just tapping in at first with this foundation I like it more as the day goes on so M because that does it goes quite it goes on quite matte and I'm not really a Maps fan I like the glue okay so that's foundation on I'm just going to use my Real Techniques spongy pinging and just hi is this a dump it's damp at moment so I'm just going to Pat it just to make sure everything's even and blend it out properly okay I'm then going to use my know I was radiant creamy concealer in caramel and this I don't put it directly like right here because that's too much product and then it will cause too much creasing so like when I'm blending it out I'll just work it up so it's not nodes I'll just put it anywhere else where I feel like I sometimes use my pro longwear as well as the NARS radiant creamy concealer but there just don't need ever telling you concede I always think like completely casinos it's really good okay I'm going to say with my Ben Nye banana powder and I'm going to use some where is it Asylum up max you fix fluid in nw15 this is for contour I know this seems like a lot of products for an everyday look but this is what I like to do and also is I don't actually use a lot or product not what anyways I want to move it so anyway I'm relieved my body shop foundation brush oh this is a blusher brush actually I know it's a foundation brush but and I'm gonna blend it I like my Punto to be quite strong contour strong I like it to be just like quite visible usually it'll be really bit more he's my blendy brush she makes sure everything's blended and undergo my body shop kabuki brush I might use my Mac mineralize skinfinish in deep dark literally use like a little bit this is just to warm up the face slightly you don't want to like to do deep contour with this you just want it to just warm up the face tattoo little bit okay ends to contour properly well to contour over the cream foundation contour contour ready I'm going to use my matte bronzer by Mac use my Real Techniques cheap brush I also have to contour my nose I like to use my Mac - - for I'm doing that I don't do it lowers just slightly we have to know that everyone has to do this okay so now I'm going to use my love's two drops and some rush we've got really watery recently I'm not Reginald boy but anyway I'm just going to put it on oh I put it on on my cheekbones I put on my forehead and a bit on my nose I'm just going to use my same a buffing brush and blend it in this is the same brush I use for my foundation okay then I get my in a mask on highlight I can't see the color it's rub dog up it is what it looks like little bit on a fan brush and we just I just put my Cheetos mainly okay then I'm going to go in with blusher I like to do my highlight before my blood like for like 800 feet just blends in a little bit a little bit more once my highlight is done and then I just blush one you just put those in there I'm going to my L ticking brush with Mac's /i it teaches okay I'm also going to use today my mac eyeliner this is in I'll go alone it's just a nude that put it in my waterline I like to use nude colors rather than white because it's just that little bit more natural and it's not just like BAM I've got white eyeliner on drumming but it still opens your eye I'm going to use a little bit of a star on the bottom eyelashes I never I don't really really up I have been recently this is just a natural collection skaara I don't ever spend money on scars because my Allah she's not long anyway so I feel like nothing makes a difference and then I use whatever color our lipstick I said of the day that could be red because you get hot purple which would just be like any powerful but normally I go for a nude on an everyday basis and today I'm going to use peach stock by Mac as quite is it that is a very nude color looks like that then I use my Mac lip gloss in wildly lush and I use my mac fix+ spray I really go in with the spray by the way like I really like I'll go in and that is what I do every day basically well not every day this is what I do this is like my go-to everyday makeup when I want to feel a bit more glam I hope you guys enjoyed it the next video probably going to do is a hair tutorial maybe I'm actually going on off on a day in ten days so I think I'm going to be doing like a blog video on like my holiday and stuff and so that should be fun but from I'm going to do obviously I'm going to put this video up I'm going to a hair tutorial then I'm gonna be away again for a while so I won't be able to put a video up for another like two to three no three to four weeks but I've seen arm away so I'm not gonna start editing the stuff and one for a day cuz I'm not bringing my laptop so yeah and I hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial and as you and see you BettyI'm not trying to show you love and affection I'm trying to live the life a kid always expect is a big is a visit music hey guys welcome back to my channel so today is going to be a Netflix and chill makeup tutorial and I know what you're thinking not the nasty Netflix and chill like none of that just actually chilling like a more chill makeup look whether you want to watch Netflix with your bottle of wine with your friends or like me me and Molly my dog just hanging out or you know something just more casual I've been wearing this look a lot recently because I still look put together but it's not the crazy wink liner or smokey eye it's a lot more low-key for me and you can even make it more minimal than what I did but this is my more chill makeup look that I usually gravitate towards and every time I wear on snapchat or Instagram I always get tons of requests for a tutorial so I wanted to do it today because I know I've been doing a lot more glam look so I wanted to keep it a little bit more low-key today and I loved how much you can switch up this makeup look if you wanted to pair this look with a dark red lip automatically it's gonna look more glam or if you want to keep it more low-key you can add just a lip balm or not do lashes there's so many options you can do with this look and I think that's why I love it so much because I have so much freedom with colors and things I want to switch out with this tutorial so I really really hope you guys enjoy it if you do recreate it don't forget to tag me so if you want to see how I get this Netflix and chill makeup look then just keep watching so first I'm going to take some of this Eddy in facial spray all over it feels so good it just like refreshes your skin and preps it and it just feels amazing and especially during winter time when my skin gets a little bit drier I like to use this so I'm going to take a little bit of Mac soft over Paint Pot just some on my finger to prime my eyelids I'm not using really any eyeshadow today but it does even up my eyelids and makes everything look 1 tone because my eyelids like you can see they're a little bit darker so I'm going to go ahead and curl my lashes because this look is really just about highlight lashes color and then I'm taking the L'Oreal telescopic mascara and I'm going to apply this this is my favorite drugstore mascara makes your lashes so so long so while that dries we're going to move on to the face first I'm going to prime my face with these Smashbox primer water for my foundation I'm using the Maybelline matte and poreless with my Beauty Blender I told you guys is my current favorite foundation I have not been able to put it down I just like to start on the outside of my face and work inwards and a little bit of this foundation goes a long way it blends so easily I like tons of redness around my nose and it just covers everything up it's 64 degrees today that's insane it's December I always like to blend a little bit down my neck too just to make sure there's no demarcation line so now I'm going to fill in my brows I'm using the Anastasia brow Wiz in dark brown I'm going to kind of speed through this because it's just how I always do but I like to start on the bottom part of the brow make my little arch kind of feather the front up a little bit you use really light strokes you don't want to put a lot of pressure towards the front you don't want it to look really harsh and then I take the brush and I brush the hair downwards just so I can kind of see the shape I want on the top I've been doing a straighter brow recently and I really like it so for my lashes I'm using lashes in the city from the lower these are the lashes I've been wearing and all of my pictures on a dream where I've done this look and I wear them all the time without any eyeshadow or anything and they just look so full and wispy and I love them one of the keys to wearing lashes is letting the glue dry you want the lash glue to get tacky before you try to apply them or else you just keep pushing it and it doesn't stick on the lashes so I let mine dry for 30 seconds before I apply I'll squeeze the false lashes and my natural lashes together while I'm like pushing it on the lash line just to get it as close as possible sometimes I'll take a felt tip eyeliner I have this one from eiko and I'll go over the band it just depends on how the lash glue dries so I'm going to let the lash glue dry and see if I need to so moving on to concealer I'm going to take the NYX HD concealer in the shade of beige to highlight and also cover up any dark circles I'm just going to blend it out with my Beauty Blender then I'm going to set my concealer with the mat shaping powder in the shade of the size and this brush from morphe this is the more feet m4 3/8 you just want to Pat it underneath the eye so you don't disrupt and move the concealer you just want to set it and this also brightens up the concealer a little bit more so I'm gonna take this nude eyeliner from NARS and that same brush just to hold down my lash line so I don't mess up my concealer I'm going to fill in my waterline with this color it just makes your eyes look a lot brighter a lot more awake and a little bit thicker so I'm going to be trying out the new chart contour chart tardies tart TARDIS TARDIS it comes with two contour shades to correcting highlight shades a blush shade and I believe this is a shimmer highlight color it smells so good smells like cocoa like the Too Faced chocolate stuff that's what smells like we're going to start with this contour color apply a little bit right here right there look good then I'm going to switch to this morphe fluffy brush and take the lighter contour color to blend it out and they set this I need two oranges so I'm going to take two colors for my blush they're both from Mac they're mineralized colors first I'm going to take out pine bronze on a duo fiber brush and I'm just going to apply that right over my contour then I'm going to mix some of a warm sole right on top so for my highlight I'm going to take champagne pop from Becca and I'm going to apply that right on the high points of my cheeks then to make it a little bit more fleeky i'm going to take some of mary lou manizer from the balm it's a lighter champagne color and apply it right on top if you can't see my highlight in the dark then there's something wrong with it and then I'm going to take some of that on the inner corners as well Loen all day I'm going to finish off the eyes with mascara I'm going to use the Rimmel lash accelerator on the lower lashes this is my favorite mascara for lower lashes it's the only one that I've used it doesn't like bleed have to be so careful when I'm doing my mascara on my lower lashes I feel like I always screw it up so now I'm going to set my face with the urban decay DEET slick setting spray so now I'm going to go to change and fix my hair and when I come back I will finish with the lip color so for my lip color I'm going to start off with makeup forever lipliner and a shade 3c so I'm going to be mixing a few different lip glosses today and I want them to show up true to color so I'm going to be taking this lippy stick from colour-pop in the shade skimpy it's a really pale nude and I'm going to apply this all over so that way my lips are a little bit more muted though it's kind of like mist from Mac is what it reminds me of so I'm going to start with a little bit of rose from dose of colors I think this has glitter in it because the texture is kind of gritty I don't really like the texture of this gloss but I love the color of it so you look like a bobby rose color and then I'm actually going to apply a little bit of Mack Flor abundance right on top this is more of like a peachy nude color so here's the finished look I really hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and to subscribe to my channel if you did now I'm going to watch Netflix I just started texture and I'm going to eat some pizza so I love you guys and thank you for watching I'll see you in my next videohey guys welcome back so today I have eight get ready with me video so I'm just going to jump right in and start with my eyebrows today I'm using my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Pro palette and I'm using a Anastasio brush as well and I'm just going to lightly fill in my brows today we're going to be using all makeup geek shadows so taking the shade creme brulée we're going to take a blending brush by morphe brushes and we're going to apply this into our crease because this is going to work as our transition shade taking the Vegas lights palette I'm going to take the shade roulette and I'm going to apply this into my crease I am using a sigma brush as always I will list the name of it in the description box below and I'm going to apply this all the way into the inner corners of my eyes I do really like this palette I feel like it's super unique because I don't have any colors that are similar to it and make a peak shadows you guys know are really good and they're super affordable so I'm thinking about doing a video with just my favorite shades because there's so many but I have like a little small palette which is like twelve of my favorite top makeup peak shadows so if that's something that you guys will want to see just let me know and I will love to do it for you guys on my lid I went ahead and applied Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and then I'm using my Inglot gel 77 eyeliner as well as a morphe brush you so if you follow me on snapchat you probably already know that my boyfriend is another country right now so he was facetiming me and I was like I miss you I miss you so much but I'm filming right now and I kind of reminded me of when we were in high school used to play baseball and we had like a long-distance relationship for like months a really long time and it just brought back all those memories so I just found that kind of funny so it's just crazy how like small things bring back so many memories but I'm going away of topic so let's go ahead and keep on with the makeup tutorial for a foundation today I decided to use my makeup forever matte velvet in the shade 40 I know you guys say that this foundation is a little bit too light for me but you have to realize that the foundation does oxidize and I used to wear 53 I started wearing 53 because you guys said that it was a little bit lighter but then 53 started to oxidize even more so it looked really dark on my face and it just it just looked really bad so I'm going back to 40 I really like how it looks on my skin and I applied it with a simply spoiled cosmetics punch which I really like and then I'm going to go in and apply my concealer and my highlight using a morphe brush this new collection by morphe brush is not even being sponsored by them but it is amazeballs you guys it's so good it's so soft and it feels super expensive to set my t-zone and my under-eye concealer I'm using a a new palette by simply spoiled cosmetics and I'm taking the yellow shade with this morphe brush it's also part of their collection just look at it it's so freakin good and it's super soft you guys to contour today I'm going to be using my favorite palette and it's the two-faced shizzle to perfection contour kit and I'm using in your brush this is the NARS eater brush the infamous brush I do really like it I feel like I don't have anything that's like it just because the bristles are super soft I have heard of people say that there's have fallen out but my friend Amy told me if you washed it a lot that happens so I'm going to take a really good care of it now moving on to my hair I'm going to apply some dry shampoo as always you guys know I love dry shampoo and I'm working on second day hair my hair like I told you guys before is super oily I cannot control it and that's just something that I have to deal with so this dry shampoo that I've been using is called a mica and you can find it at Sephora it's really good it doesn't have any residue you guys saw when I sprayed it on my roots it didn't have any left over so that's something that I really like and it smells so good it actually smells like you just left the salon and your hair is freshly done except in reality it's all by the way how cute does Mark look he looks so freaking adorable and I took him to get a haircut today and he's just like he's feeling post-acute like I'm feeling myself home so I went ahead and applied an accessibility health liquid lipstick and turn Hollywood this will be always one of my favorites I just love love love this lipstick so today I felt like whitening my teeth and today I'm using a new set which I haven't used before but on the first try my teeth were like two shades lighter so I do really like it so what I like to do is I like to apply it in the container and then I put it in my mouth for five to ten minutes so if I have to put on any jewelry which I do like my watch my bracelets and actually these bracelets that I'm going to show you right now they're from luck always the website that you can customize bracelets necklace earrings just a whole bunch of stuff and just how adorable is it it has a DNC for Dianna Chantal and actually have the necklace as well which is super pretty if you haven't seen it on my snapchat you go see it right now just go see it for my nails today I'm just going to remove my nail polish and I feel like this is just magic in a bottle it removes it super fast and I'm just going to go with something nude because that's what I'm feeling right now and this nail polish actually mentioned in my last video which if you haven't seen go see it because it's a fashionable and I really like it it's called topless and barefoot by Essie and then moving on to my outfit and of course McAvoy always has to be in the video my shoes are from Saks Fifth Avenue my skirt is from TJ Maxx and my top is from forever 21 I hope you guys enjoyed this video as always I love you all so much thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all very soon in my next video bye guysso this week's video is going to be all about how to do winged liner I literally get requested for me to do this video every single day on my Instagram so if you haven't noticed I did get my hands on a new camera super excited because I will be uploading videos every Monday um before we get started with this tutorial I just first wanted to tell you guys a couple of things before we get started um I'm not going to lie to you I'm not gonna I don't want to edit this video too much just because I want you guys to see the raw footage on how it is exactly how I do my winged liner because I trust me I've watched literally every eyeliner tutorial that exists here on YouTube and for some reason I just like they cut things and you know you don't know what it is that they do on their off camera you know what I mean so I tried to make this video as short as possible to get straight to the point but not cutting off certain things that you don't see on camera or off camera I mean another thing is that just keep in mind that you're the one in control of the makeup the makeup doesn't control you just be really patient it's just makeup it comes right off another thing don't try to attempt to doing liner on a day that your going to go out because if it doesn't come out right your going to be really upset you're not going to want to go to the damn party so I just say that from experience because that happened to me every single time so just try to do it when you have time at night when you're on Instagram or whatever another thing is that what might work for me might not work for you so you know if you like to do a gel liner then do gel liner if you like to do liquid liner then do if you like to certain brush just don't let this video influence you you know you you can't really you know everyone has their own little rituals like let me tell you like what I first started learning how to doing lighter like it was it was horrible like I would literally have to turn on every light turn off my music lock the door and praise the eyeliner gods like eyeliner gods like really like that doesn't even exist but that's that's what I had to do like the struggle is real also you don't have to splurge on products it's not how much you spend on the product it's how you use it so just be patient and there's no such thing as perfectly lawyers what I'm trying to say you can be really good at it but you know when you're done with it one might look longer one might look shorter should just learn to accept the fact that there's no such thing as perfect wing liner one is going to look a little different than the others just keep that in mind don't get frustrated and maybe maybe it will help you pray the eyeliner gods I don't know just try in my work so I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial if you have any requests for me to do any other videos please leave them in the comments down below with that being said I hope you guys enjoy this I will see you guys next week so the first thing you want to start off with is obviously an eyeliner brush this is my personal favorite to use and it's a 210 by Mac the gel liner that we're going to be using today is the Maybelline black gel liner I love this because it is super cheap and it only retails for eight dollars versus the mac cosmetics one which retails for about 18 to 20 I believe we're going to be using this brush today to clean up the wing of our winged liner I believe elf has a dupe for this one that retails for a dollar as well also going to need some concealer or you can also use foundation to help clean up the edge last but not least you're going to need some brush cleaner or here as I am using some alcohol this is ninety percent alcohol and a little rag to help clean up your brush in between you so before I start what I like to do is scoop out some of the product with my brush and then apply it on the back of my hand the back of my hand is going to help heat up the product so the eyeliner just goes on a little smoother and then I like to twist my brush with in the product to help get the point on the brush so the lines come out thinner and much more precise so before you start just go ahead and use your eyebrow as kind of a guideline from where to start your line and then where to end it so I like to do both of my eyes at the same time that way I can get it as evenly as I possibly can what I forget to you like and so inside and then I like to start forming a line from the inner corner of my eye towards the middle I like to do little sections at a time and if you notice there are little bumps in between don't get frustrated when this happens because I know a lot of you tend to get really frustrated just take your time and then we can go back in with the tip of the brush to even out the line so the moment you start to feel that the product and your brush is starting to get stiff go ahead and use that alcohol or brush cleaner that I told you to clean in between uses this is key when doing your winged liner because if you keep tugging at dry gel liner you're gonna get a lot of those little bumps and it's going to be much harder to fill it in later if it's not gliding on if that makes sense I'm turning see so what you're pretty much doing is just creating a normal gel liner without the wing and then after we do this part we're gonna go ahead and connect it when doing this part just keep applying more eyeliner because sometimes when you use shimmery eyeshadows it tends to make the eyeliner appeal appeal appear a little bit gray so just go ahead and keep applying the product to get it as black as possible massaging me I'm late ok so now we're going to go ahead and connect the wing you can start connecting it either from the beginning or from the end just just depending on how dramatic you want it you can add a little curve or you can go straight it all depends on personal preference and then after you connect it you can just go ahead and fill it in and yeah it's it's not that hard guys it just it just takes practice I promise keep practicing in your will get better Oh so I'm going to do the other side um if you notice they don't look exactly the same but you just kind of have to keep pulling with it if one looks thicker than the other then go back to the other side make it a little bit thicker but what I love about this is that once you grab your concealer in that flat brush you can make the point even point here you can elongate it and then you just pretty much drag it downward and after you apply your foundation it's going to blend in um later so yeah this is pretty much how I do my winged liner if I ever do decide to change my routine I will be sure to update you guys in another video umm yeah with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I hope it has helped you please tag me in your pictures on Instagram if you do attempt to do this and I will see you guys all next week me I'm late okayhey guys and welcome back to my channel today's makeup tutorial is going to be inspired by Kylie Jenner's makeup and makeup has been absolutely gorgeous recently so I really wanted to recreate one of her recent looks like saw on her Instagram so the first step is going to be applying my primer this is the makeup forever step 1 smoothing primer and I'm just applying on all of my bumpy areas which is basically in the center of my face and then I'm taking my Mac Studio Fix fluid and this is in the color NC 40 it looks very yellow but it is going to blend with my neck I promise all of Mark NC colors do come out very stark and yellow but this is going to blend into my skin perfectly soon I promise I'm just blending that in and building up as much coverage as I need with my Real Techniques miracle complexion sponge just because Kylie's look was really full coverage her skin just looks absolutely flawless so I wanted to recreate that and just make sure my skin looked nice matte and flawless next I'm going to be priming my eyes using my soft ochre Paint Pot this is just going to prep my eyes for any eyeshadow that we're going to apply and it's just going to make it blend really easily then I'm going to take Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and this is just going to be my first transition color and I'm just going to buy a really small amount of that into the crease and then I'm going to take creme brulee which is just another makeup geek shadow and just apply this into the deeper part of my crease Kylie didn't have a lot going on in her crease the main sort of attraction was the lid color so next I'm going to be applying magic act which is one of my favorite makeup geek eyeshadows and this is a foiled one and that's just this color here and this is going to create the most gorgeous shimmery effect and just the most gorgeous just gorgeous gold so it's just amazing so I'm just going to apply this all over with a synthetic brush and this will just create that really gorgeous glistening look that Kylie had then I'm going to be taking shimma shimma which is another makeup geek eyeshadow as you can see I've been loving makeup geek at the moment and just applying that into my inner corners just because I want to create that really nice open eyed effect then I'm just going to take some liquid glitter liner this one is from NYX and just be applying it all on top of where we place that fold eyes shadow just to finish off then I'm just gonna apply some mascara and then we're going to pop on our false lashes I honestly feel like Kylie's lip color and the false lashes are what kind of create this look so go for some really long spiky lashes hers were very long almost touching her brows they were so long and they really opened up our eyes so I am of course going for some really long dramatic lashes and just making sure they blend into my lash line I'm just applying a little bit of liquid liner just where I need to so that it looks as natural as possible then I'm just going to fill in my brows as I usually do I don't have a similar shape of brow to Kylee so I'm just going to go for my normal shape go for whatever you feel suits your face the best so I'm just using some concealer to go underneath my brow then I'm using the Mac waterproof browser which is basically finished but I don't have another brow set or brow mascara so I'm just trying to make the most of it and just putting my brows into place and then I'm just filling them in with Mac's spiked eyebrow pencil then I'm gonna be using my Maybelline fit me concealer and just be applying this underneath my eyes and just kind of taking it down the sides of my nose just to kind of narrow down my nose a little bit Kylie's under-eye highlight was very intense so I'm going to be going with a much lighter concealer as well just on the higher points of my face but first I'm going to apply this onto my forehead and also onto my chin next I'm going to be taking the mineralized concealer from Mac and just be applying this on to the high points of my face this is an NC 15 so it's a very light color but this is going to give me a really nice bright effect and I'm also going to be applying this on to the bridge of my nose just to narrow it down a little bit just because my nose is not as petite as Kiley's unfortunately then I'm taking the miracle complexion sponge by Real Techniques and just doing this to make sure my skin looks all nice and blended together and there are no harsh lines and once I've done that I'm going to go in with a brush also just to make sure that I get into all the little tiny areas I can't reach and for that I'm going to be using my Sigma 3d HD precision brush and you guys know I absolutely love this brush it's the most easiest to concealer brush to use and especially when you want to get into them tiny little areas and you don't have ruined the eye makeup that you just previously applied it's the best I absolutely love this brush and I'm also using that to blend in my nose highlight as well to set my under eyes first I'm using a Tom Ford blush brush and my Mac CC correct powder in the neutralized shade and just using this to Pat it onto my under eyes first because I want to make sure that there are no creases you want to make sure that you catch the creasing before it begins and then I'm just using my sponge to apply that same powder and just start to bake my face this is just going to give us that really gorgeous bright effect it's also going to prevent anything from moving at the same time so I'm just applying this onto the high points of my face and just underneath where my contour is going to go so today I'm going to be cream contouring because you know the Kardashians loved contour and Kylie's face always looks really gorgeous and ruptured so I'm going to be cream contouring and powder contouring today which is not something I usually do but I'm just doing that in all the areas that I want to give the appearance of a sunken in effect I'm doing on these sides of my face on the cheekbones and also on my jaw line and to contour I use the RCM a foundation palette at the moment I'm just dusting away the powder we just applied just because I want to start blending in the contour in the areas where it might blend into the powder a little bit so I want to make sure that's all buffed away and I'm just using that same sponge to make sure it's all blended in and it all looks nice and subtle and then I'm just taking that sponge but I was using before just to clean up underneath the contour now I'm just bronzing my skin to give myself a really gorgeous glowed effect because Kylie does always look quite matte but she does look a nice and bronzed so I'm just making sure to give myself a lot of color just so I look nice and summery because this look is actually really perfect for summer then I'm taking the Bahama Mama bronzer which is one of my favourite powders to contour with just because it still is warm but it's not completely orangie at the same time so I'm just using that in the hollows of my cheeks just to give a little bit more definition and then I'm just going to be applying onto these sides of my forehead as well next we're going to start finishing off the eyes and I'm using a frappe which is also a makeup geek eyeshadow and just taking a fluffy Sigma blending brush and just be applying that onto my bottom lash line and then also be applying some mascara just to balance the top and the bottom lash line and because Kylie's eyes look huge in the picture I'm referring to I'm going to be applying a skin tone pencil into my waterline to make my eyes look larger than they actually are next I'm just highlighting a little bit onto my cheekbones just because Kylie's face does look very matte but I can't imagine she wouldn't be wearing a highlight so I did want to apply a little bit on to my cheekbones just on the highest point and then I'm taking that Bahama Mama bronzer again and just using that to very lightly contour my nose Kylie doesn't usually contour her nose but I feel like I need to it's like my safety net and I just feel like I need to do it so go for whatever you feel suits your face and then I'm just applying a little bit of highlight onto the tip of my nose just to turn it upwards a little bit and then to finish off I went for a really simple matte lip look at the moment I'm using NYX natural lip liner and then I'm taking Mac honey love just because she looked like she had a really cool nude lip going on and then I'm just going around it with stone lip liner just to give a little bit more definition because I kind of felt like my lips with disappearing into my skin a little bit so do whatever you feel suits your skin tone this is of course not for every single skin tone so go for whatever nude lipstick suits you and this is the finished look guys I hope you enjoyed this tutorial please don't forget to comment down below any other videos you would like to see and thumbs up this video because it honestly does help me out so much so like we like button to like this video because it helps me out a ton and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I can't wait to see you guys in my next video and I will talk to you later bye guyshey guys so welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be one of my most requested videos actually it is my top favorite best morphe brushes that I think are totally worth the money and which ones I think that you need to go out and buy just to have a good like set of morphe brushes not necessarily set but having your own like good amount of morphe brushes you know I'm saying this is the thing about working brushes they are all so cost-efficient amazing quality like frickin like Mac and Sigma status like quality and they're so so so so so cheap like they're so good dry brushes range from like 3 to like 7 bucks like they're just amazing and I've been getting so many requests because I use them all the time another great thing about working is I have a code with them it is the Commission code so I do make a small Commission if you guys use my code but you guys don't have to use my code if that's not your thing you guys don't like to do like no Commission thing or like buying things using codes and stuff like that then it's all good you don't have to do that I'm just saying you get 10% off if you use my code mani anyway in all caps 10% off the entire site so I think that's pretty good lying you guys it if you want I'm you don't have to if I can do it oh by the way if you don't like it we know we know the drill so we're going to put this up into two categories we're gonna do face ones I'm ready to I ones I'll leave both face I you want to get to them let's do face ones first cuz you're gonna take the longest are you fuckin first we're gonna talk about is my face foundation brush I use all the time if you guys see me doing a face tutorial with besides using like a Beauty Blender I'm using this brush this is the m43 9 basically what I love about this brush is that it's extremely extremely thick and dense and the applies foundation so beautifully it gives you a flawless finish and gives you more of like an airbrushed finish because it's so dense as you can see it's a very very dense foundation never gets down to here like ever ever we're just gonna do the bitch to clean it's a nice big brush it's great for my man face for me too like a brush that's a foundation brush with a kabuki brush I think this one is absolutely amazing obviously you have a smaller face than me you're gonna love it too but I'm just saying it works great with my big aunt thing it's perfect so for concealer I love this brush this is the m33 5 which is basically the small baby version of the last one I just talked about it is so adorable besides okay obviously what is it besides being adorable how you love to use this for concealer for the under-eye concealer to really blend out the excess product I don't need there honestly like I need to do is put a little bit by the eye doesn't it under that buff it out and this one does an amazing amazing job with it it's also a very dense brush and it's just it's small its tightening it's perfect it fits under the eye I think it's absolutely amazing it's a steal if you guys are into more like cream contouring and stuff it's fantastic at getting into the contours and the holes of the face and buffing out as well this is just a great buffing brush just like the other one is but a much smaller baby version of it so I know me okay let's talk about another one that I think is amazing for the under eye area this one is the morphe g2 which is basically like this tapered foundation brush is another very dense brush as you can tell I'm very much into buffing brushes as you can see what I like about the g2 so much is that it also takes away concealer beautifully you can apply concealer and you can take out we can see there so well with this brush but it's also great at highlighting I use this in my cream contour like review of the new Anastasio cream contour kits pretend this is the palette and I like that I applied I can use it from foundation you can use it for contouring I love that its taper at the end too so you can technically go in and contour with this or you can just use it for the under-eye concealing or highlighting or anything like that it's big enough where you get a good nice variety and you can get a larger conference at one time but it's not like two big words like like m4 3/9 definitely so on that so I think it's just a great brush you get a lot of control of this brush and it reminds me a lot of the Sigma tapered one which is a lot cheaper and a lot more just cost-efficient and I think it's great next one is gonna be the morphe g3 which is basically this doing so funny I was cracking up because like all my brushes that I'm like showing you guys are basically like dirty cuz I use them today to do my makeup and I was thinking oh my gosh I'd wash the brushes for them like I want anything about dirty bitch and I don't wash my brushes and stuff yeah but then I thought you know what like obviously I'm got tougher brushes that I use all the time why not just show them dirty like so you guys to know that I do use them all the time I do some today so okay sorry if you're not into that dirty shit but I am basically this brush is meant for cream contouring or powder contouring basically which every um I love about it is that it's such a dense also type of kabuki brush but the paddle is flat as you can see it's a completely flat brush and it's so amazing at getting into the hall the face and buffing in cream or liquid or powder anything like that it's so good at buffing out like a contour highlight or anything like that this one is one of my top favorite brushes I use one nearly every day every single time I use my makeup I use this one because I love it for contouring it's so good it just it's right amount of denseness it picks up product and beautifully it buffs up product beautifully it is so worth the money I love the the gunmetal series is one my favorite for more for you the good metals are just so good they're so good I love love love it now we're gonna talk about the m4 38 this brush I use literally in like I think every single tutorial I've done like a face thing I've used this brush this brush is my life so what I love about this one is that I use it for the under eye setting this brush is so pretty because it's so long it's perfect I getting underneath the eye my gosh it okay like this is the perfect under eye setting brush it's so soft it's dense enough where it picks up product beautifully and a lay style product really nicely as well and it doesn't put down too much I love to like go in with a powder get it with the powder and just kind of run it in there and dust off the excess off using my ring and then just kind of go in and set my under eye with it this brush is absolutely amazing this is just like it's one of my favorite brushes I've ever gotten from more feet ever ever I use it all the time beautiful at setting under eye makeup concealer anything like a nice one to my face once the next special mint aqua is the g8 brush this one I love love-love-love because it's also a flat brush very similar to the other one though talking about the contouring one but it's like a flat and it's tapered at the end I personally use those from blush all the time it gets tapered off on the sides out if you guys can tell but the way that bristles are cut it gives you a nice paper but they're extremely soft so if you want to go in would stick a little bit of blush you can just go on the tip and blend in and if you want to go in with a lot you can just press the whole brush into the blush and just go ham go ahead with that blush dude it's amazing it's amazing it's amazing amazing it's amazing it's all me scene and the last face we're gonna talk about is the morphe g7 basically just your everyday powder brush the reason I love this powder brush is that it's so thick I use this for bronzer I use this for powder raises for anything to do with powdering like my neck powdering my face and you can do with it I use this it's dense enough but it's not too dense where you lay down a shit out of powder and you look cakey so that's why I love this one so so so much it just gives you such a wide circumference like okay how it looks on my face it covers a good amount you know I mean so I go in with the bronzer on here not really just kind of dust in the bronzer into my face if I just want to go with Mormon bronzy look and same with powder I'll just kind of go down my neck just to kind of match it with my face a little bit I think that this brush is amazing if you're looking for a good powder brush that is high-quality that's not gonna pick up too much powder but it's gonna lay a good amount down try the g-seven it's amazing it's so amazing forgive that it's dirty I used it today obviously so now we're gonna go ahead move on to the eye brushes this is the eyebrows portion I have five brushes in the eye brush section as to me having seven in the face ones but I think a good couple high brushes will take you so so so so so far so far so damn far so we're going to start from the smallest to the biggest this one they just launched I just got it literally yesterday and it's the morphe M 508 which is this tiny um I'd use it today it's seriously like this brush is like revolutionary for me this one is so amazing at getting underneath your under eye area because it's so so so freaking tiny goanna getting underneath the lash line that's what I use it for I think this is amazing if you're into putting shadow underneath your eye and underneath your lashes this brush is so crucial it's not too stiff where you pick up so much product and you deposit so much product but it since it's so tiny it's amazing and getting underneath the lashes and really kind of buffing out the product thing it's literally like four bucks I honestly I don't know how morphe you guys I don't know how they forget survive I don't know how they do it I really don't amazing brush it's amazing let's go ahead and move on to the next one we're gonna go ahead and talk about the morphe 320 brush which is this this flat brush this brush is crucial for people and the reason I think it's cause I have three of Emily and I'm getting a three this brush is an amazing flat dense packing brush I use this with loose pigment uses with eyeshadow I use this with glitter ie you can use this brush with anything because it's so dense picks up product amazingly ended posits amazingly since and synthetic it doesn't like Harbert and your product in the brush I use this today to apply like my lid color that's why it's dirty fact that is pointed you have so much control and you can like really get up to that crease like where you want it to stop already wanting to keep going everyone needs a good packing brush especially one that's really dense I think the 320 is amazing for that okay cool next brushes let's go ahead and do the next one this one is the M for three three you guys know I use this in literally every single tutorial since I've got it it is basically the equivalent of a Mac 217 or Sigma e25 I think this one is just as good and it's literally like $5.99 I think or six bucks it's a white go hairbrush do you guys are interested in like did Mac 217 or Sigma e25 try this one out first if you guys like it I think the m4 33 is a main zing so worth the price likes okay two more I remember them the morphe M 505 which they just launched this one is I love this one so much I just got yesterday till I just until time this one is basically a tapered blending brush it reminds me very much of the Sigma e-40 but a tapered version of it what I love on spur so much is that it's so amazed at literally getting in to like the crevice of your eye depositing color and blending it out right then in there I was waiting for more food creative brush that's very very very very soft pointed and it's great at getting in the crease of your eye amazing a buffing amazing at blending amazing at depositing color this special is just mom it's so bomb look how cute it is I'm getting me fucking adorable last but not least darling last not least the morphe m4 for one with basically a large fluffy version of the m4 three three this is a great fluffy brush just applying any kind of shadow into the crease or if you want to do like a whole lid color this is just a great fluffy brush that I think is just one of those crucial fluffy brushes it's like the Sigma e-40 just the white go here version of it very soft bomb.com so yes that was it for my favorite morphe brushes I've been getting so many requests to make this video these are just some of my favorite morphe brushes that

just like a orangie peachy kind of ad which you can't get from the name like peach I guess and I'm just going to apply this to the bags onto my eyes with a 142 concealer buffer brush look at the difference there seriously serious guys don't have a corrector and you have that under eyes it is so good oh yeah and now I'm just um using the Maybelline anti age rewind concealer in the shade elect peel and now a foundation I have been loving both of these foundations so oh oh oh my god anyway I've been loving them both so much lately they're like my guru foundations and I broke them both to the table here because I didn't know when I was going to use but I think I'm gonna go with my trusty old Make Up For Ever HD foundation and I'm in the shade and 127 ok so now it's time to highlight and I'm going to using the Rimmel wake me up anti fatigue effect in radiant glow concealer it's a very long name Emily okay so this is actually my first time using this normally I would use my NARS radiant creamy concealer and this is in the shared light one Chantilly you and now taking my Laura Mercier translucent powder to set this and this is the best what's we're coming out the best like powder to set under your eyes evolved in the history of ever next for the rest of the face I'm going to be taking my nose Prescott in the shade beach on Miami gloss number one powder brush now I'm taking my hourglass ambient lighting bronzer and it's in the shade luminous bronze and light luminous bronze light and my one to six Lux cheek finish brush from zoeva to contour I'm going to be using my hoola by benefit bronzer on my Mac small contour brush so what I use for blush is Britt crazy I use three different ones and one of them is not even a blush so the first two I grab are these two here they're from makeup geek this one down here is smitten and this is infatuation and then I also take my Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit and shave light to medium and I take this darkest like orangey shade here as well and I mix them all together on a blush brush so now I'm going to go for a bath in some highlighter this is the mary lou manizer hideout up from balm and a morphe m51 brush so now I'm going to get started on my eyes and the first thing I want to do is prime them with a little bit of my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and this is a Real Techniques deluxe crease brush which is pretty much exactly the same as a concealer buffer brush from zoeva but I actually like the real technique one better because it's just like fluffier I just an inner it's fluffy ah it feels better I feel like it blends product out a lot better so on my acid and me use my favorite ever pallor which somehow I managed to make a dent in and now doesn't open the whole way but I literally don't know what I did to it I don't know I just pulled it out of the drawer and I was like this and I was like what the heck happened in the drawer it's like the Toy Story movie my makeup like comes alive beats each other up and then like when I'm in the room and I come and roll they were like laughs loose makeup products again anyway this is like my Holy Grail make up front up makeup palette I love to I wish the true face would make like single eyeshadows because I think I would go crazy on them and just buy every single one that they ever created but anyway I'm gonna grab it coconut Ram which is just like this cream color and I'm just going to set the soft ochre and now I'm gonna pick up my Sigma e35 and the shade peanut butter here and I'm just going to apply this into my crease and I apply this in like a rounded shape rather than bringing out and I take it all the way in to the inner corner now I'm going to pick up a pencil brush this is the 231 luxe petit crease brush from zoeva and I'm going to grab the share truffled here which is just like a chocolate brown one and I'm just going to apply this into my crease as well I'm just going to apply a little bit of frosting and bond one and I'm going to place this all over the lid and now I'm picking up a little bit of butter pecan and I'm just going to apply this right into the center and now just picking up a little bit of peanut butta again and this is on a wolfy East 17 brush I'm going to place this on my waterline on my lower lash line by donor level and just picking up s Sigma e 15 flat definer brush I'm going to take a

stuff like that so I have these Coker lashes here and they are in the style of Bella because I'm going to do is I'm going to line my lips using the Mac lipliner in the shade whirl and it's really funny because like everyone over lines their lips but I feel like my bottom lip is too big for my top lip so I underline it like I make it appear small up because I don't know I don't like to over

will talk to you guys in the next one bye love you guys [Music]hey guys and welcome back to my channel today's makeup tutorial is going to be inspired by Kylie Jenner's makeup and makeup has been absolutely gorgeous recently so I really wanted to recreate one of her recent looks like saw on her Instagram so the first step is going to be applying my primer this is the makeup forever step 1 smoothing primer and I'm just applying on all of my bumpy areas which is basically in the center of my face and then I'm taking my Mac Studio Fix fluid and this is in the color NC 40 it looks very yellow but it is going to blend with my neck I promise all of Mark NC colors do come out very stark and yellow but this is going to blend into my skin perfectly soon I promise I'm just blending that in and building up as much coverage as I need with my Real Techniques miracle complexion sponge just because Kylie's look was really full coverage her skin just looks absolutely flawless so I wanted to recreate that and just make sure my skin looked nice matte and flawless next I'm going to be priming my eyes using my soft ochre Paint Pot this is just going to prep my eyes for any eyeshadow that we're going to apply and it's just going to make it blend really easily then I'm going to take Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and this is just going to be my first transition color and I'm just going to buy a really small amount of that into the crease and then I'm going to take creme brulee which is just another makeup geek shadow and just apply this into the deeper part of my crease Kylie didn't have a lot going on in her crease the main sort of attraction was the lid color so next I'm going to be applying magic act which is one of my favorite makeup geek eyeshadows and this is a foiled one and that's just this color here and this is going to create the most gorgeous shimmery effect and just the most gorgeous just gorgeous gold so it's just amazing so I'm just going to apply this all over with a synthetic brush and this will just create that really gorgeous glistening look that Kylie had then I'm going to be taking shimma shimma which is another makeup geek eyeshadow as you can see I've been loving makeup geek at the moment and just applying that into my inner corners just because I want to create that really nice open eyed effect then I'm just going to take some liquid glitter liner this one is from NYX and just be applying it all on top of where we place that fold eyes shadow just to finish off then I'm just gonna apply some mascara and then we're going to pop on our false lashes I honestly feel like Kylie's lip color and the false lashes are what kind of create this look so go for some really long spiky lashes hers were very long almost touching her brows they were so long and they really opened up our eyes so I am of course going for some really long dramatic lashes and just making sure they blend into my lash line I'm just applying a little bit of liquid liner just where I need to so that it looks as natural as possible then I'm just going to fill in my brows as I usually do I don't have a similar shape of brow to Kylee so I'm just going to go for my normal shape go for whatever you feel suits your face the best so I'm just using some concealer to go underneath my brow then I'm using the Mac waterproof browser which is basically finished but I don't have another brow set or brow mascara so I'm just trying to make the most of it and just putting my brows into place and then I'm just filling them in with Mac's spiked eyebrow pencil then I'm gonna be using my Maybelline fit me concealer and just be applying this underneath my eyes and just kind of taking it down the sides of my nose just to kind of narrow down my nose a little bit Kylie's under-eye highlight was very intense so I'm going to be going with a much lighter concealer as well just on the higher points of my face but first I'm going to apply this onto my forehead and also onto my chin next I'm going to be taking the mineralized concealer from Mac and just be applying this on to the high points of my face this is an NC 15 so it's a very light color but this is going to give me a really nice bright effect and I'm also going to be applying this on to the bridge of my nose just to narrow it down a little bit just because my nose is not as petite as Kiley's unfortunately then I'm taking the miracle complexion sponge by Real Techniques and just doing this to make sure my skin looks all nice and blended together and there are no harsh lines and once I've done that I'm going to go in with a brush also just to make sure that I get into all the little tiny areas I can't reach and for that I'm going to be using my Sigma 3d HD precision brush and you guys know I absolutely love this brush it's the most easiest to concealer brush to use and especially when you want to get into them tiny little areas and you don't have ruined the eye makeup that you just previously applied it's the best I absolutely love this brush and I'm also using that to blend in my nose highlight as well to set my under eyes first I'm using a Tom Ford blush brush and my Mac CC correct powder in the neutralized shade and just using this to Pat it onto my under eyes first because I want to make sure that there are no creases you want to make sure that you catch the creasing before it begins and then I'm just using my sponge to apply that same powder and just start to bake my face this is just going to give us that really gorgeous bright effect it's also going to prevent anything from moving at the same time so I'm just applying this onto the high points of my face and just underneath where my contour is going to go so today I'm going to be cream contouring because you know the Kardashians loved contour and Kylie's face always looks really gorgeous and ruptured so I'm going to be cream contouring and powder contouring today which is not something I usually do but I'm just doing that in all the areas that I want to give the appearance of a sunken in effect I'm doing on these sides of my face on the cheekbones and also on my jaw line and to contour I use the RCM a foundation palette at the moment I'm just dusting away the powder we just applied just because I want to start blending in the contour in the areas where it might blend into the powder a little bit so I want to make sure that's all buffed away and I'm just using that same sponge to make sure it's all blended in and it all looks nice and subtle and then I'm just taking that sponge but I was using before just to clean up underneath the contour now I'm just bronzing my skin to give myself a really gorgeous glowed effect because Kylie does always look quite matte but she does look a nice and bronzed so I'm just making sure to give myself a lot of color just so I look nice and summery because this look is actually really perfect for summer then I'm taking the Bahama Mama bronzer which is one of my favourite powders to contour with just because it still is warm but it's not completely orangie at the same time so I'm just using that in the hollows of my cheeks just to give a little bit more definition and then I'm just going to be applying onto these sides of my forehead as well next we're going to start finishing off the eyes and I'm using a frappe which is also a makeup geek eyeshadow and just taking a fluffy Sigma blending brush and just be applying that onto my bottom lash line and then also be applying some mascara just to balance the top and the bottom lash line and because Kylie's eyes look huge in the picture I'm referring to I'm going to be applying a skin tone pencil into my waterline to make my eyes look larger than they actually are next I'm just highlighting a little bit onto my cheekbones just because Kylie's face does look very matte but I can't imagine she wouldn't be wearing a highlight so I did want to apply a little bit on to my cheekbones just on the highest point and then I'm taking that Bahama Mama bronzer again and just using that to very lightly contour my nose Kylie doesn't usually contour her nose but I feel like I need to it's like my safety net and I just feel like I need to do it so go for whatever you feel suits your face and then I'm just applying a little bit of highlight onto the tip of my nose just to turn it upwards a little bit and then to finish off I went for a really simple matte lip look at the moment I'm using NYX natural lip liner and then I'm taking Mac honey love just because she looked like she had a really cool nude lip going on and then I'm just going around it with stone lip liner just to give a little bit more definition because I kind of felt like my lips with disappearing into my skin a little bit so do whatever you feel suits your skin tone this is of course not for every single skin tone so go for whatever nude lipstick suits you and this is the finished look guys I hope

i'm just going to tape with this on my hands and apply it all over my face next thing I'm going to do is go in with my foundation and when I originally did this makeup look I just using makeup forever Ultra HD foundation but I kind of want more of a matte makeup look so I went to mix the Maybelline Dream velvet foundation with my makeup forever foundation so next I'm going to be going in and color correcting I always color back to my face and I'm going to be using the NYX color correcting concealer palette a morph age 20 CO and palate I like the orange concealer shade and this one and then I'm going to be highlighting my under eyes and certain areas with my urban decay naked skin concealer and next I wish you go in and cream contour today because I want my face to be more you know

under eye concealer or baking as everyone refers to it and I'm going to be using the hoodie ariston powder that I picked up at the drugstore I have to use this once already and I do like it it has kind of an old ladyish smell to it but if you can get past that actual powder is really good man I smell like an eight year old woman but I don't care maybe they'll actually you know keep men from hitting on me tonight the reason why I'm going out tonight is my friend Pia if you're watching this Pia I'm gonna miss you she is actually moving so we're having a little like going away party kind of thing for her so yeah that's why I'm going out tonight so next I'm going to go in and set my cream contour with a powder contour and I'm going to be using benefit hoola bronzer I really like this because it's very natural looking it's not too dark and I'm already starting I'm already starting to hit pan on it I don't think I've ever like really hit pan on anything yet so this is kind of stop and I am still looking pale as hell so i am going to warm up my face a little bit with my makeup forever bronzer okay so i went ahead and did my brows and i've used the anastasia beverly hills dipbrow pomade and i used it in the shade medium brown if you guys want to see you a video about my brows let me know because I kind of change up the way that I do them and I'm just going to go in with a little bit of the clear brow gel and just set them all right so now in which you move on to my eyes so I'm going to be using the morphe 35o palette and I know like I've done a million tutorials with this palette but it's really wearable and it's the one that I use to fill this tutorial in the picture so I'm going to use it and we try to remember the colors that I've used cuz it's been a few days I'm going to go in with this kind of quad of eyeshadows right here and I'm first going to start with the transition shade which is going to be this color right here and I'm just going to apply those of my crease next I'm going to be applying this kind of shimmery topi bronze shadow and I'm going to apply this all over my lid so next I'm going to be going in with this shade above the first transition tree that we use and I'm going to kind of darken up the crease a little bit and next I'm going to be going in with a color pop super shop shadows I love these shadows because they're not really like glitter but they just get the I like an extra something and I'm going to be using the shade millionaire and I love this color it's like a bronzy color and I really really like it so I'm just going to apply this over the shadow i already have applied on my lid and i'm going to do that with my finger because these shadows just work a little bit better with your finger I kind of like to use these shadows and more like a patting motion because I feel like if I'm swiping that I'm kind of like wiping it off you're just a very interesting texture so if you guys want you can have end that I look here but I'm going out so I want a little bit more of a smoky look so I am just going to be adding a darker brown morphy shadow on the outer because my eye so if you guys were wondering about alternate uses for your vib rouge card from sephora this is one of them okay so I went off camera and did my eyeliner because I'm really picky in sometimes it takes me awhile but I did use the NYX matte liquid liner because it dries to a matte finish and I like that and I'm going to be priming my eyelashes for fake lashes and i'm using the occult covergirl clump of i blast pro mascara and while i'm waiting for my mascaras dry i am going to be applying my blush and i'm going to be using milani rose to aura blush and i love these Milani blushes they're from the drugstore but they are so great today I'm going to be using pull or lashes and I'm going to be using these style girl you crazy and I've been using these lashes for like almost a year and I absolutely love these so while my lash glue is drying I'm going to be applying some highlight and I'm going to be using the new Anasazi of Beverly Hills glow kit and this is the that glow glow kit and I'm going to use these shade bubbly

finished makeup look I hope you guys enjoyed this look I know many of you said it was like your favorite that I ever did so that was really exciting so I wanted to make sure that i did a tutorial on this look for you guys so leave me some comments below and i absolutely love you guys and I will see you soon byehi everyone so I'm back with a best school makeup tutorial I know it's only like the mentor of August but everyone goes back to school the beginning of September so I just get this video up and get it ready so you guys can pay yourself or going back to school see you home think in the head si si so I said I blabbering on I'm just gonna get them with a tutorial and yeah I hope you guys like it it's already boys drive must commence cleaning dramatically different moisturizing cream this particular one is for very dryer to dry combination skin I love this moisturizer is amazing for moisturizing and I will continue to purchase this forever I've also used this body shop bitter mini ice cream underneath my eyes I find that when I use this and I put concealer on my casino comes out better and I've got a lot of priests in going on under my eyes for a 20 year old I think is ridiculous I have a lot of crease underneath my eyes so I need i green definitely I've also sprayed my face with the Mac prep and prime it fix plus because it's just needed before after during makeup always ever and I've used this a forever ello lips lip balm okay so I'm going to start with brows as per usual I'm going to be using my normal Mac eyebrow pencil in that spiked I'm looking over here because of my mirrors over here obviously its school we don't want to go too harsh with eyebrows because I know what I think of school makeup I just think of it being a fairly light and not much to it but you still made a bit of effort so I'm basically just following my natural eyebrow shape and might create an art whether it is meant to be an arch for my eyebrow justice or it's not to grow you want when you're doing your eyebrows you want to keep brushing it with one of these brushes because then it makes the eyebrow much softer when I get to the front I like to go in the direction of the hairs that are going up so I like to use my eyebrow and so and go up if they're fairly natural I think I think the special that I've ended up so with my eyebrows I like to use concealer under my eyebrows because I just think it looks a lot neater the Urban Decay concealer this is a bit lighter than my skin tone right now but what's woodlands doing this stuff will be fine use my concealer brush by sheer cover I've never fired better a concealer brush then this one I could use in a few years and I blend it with my Real Techniques deluxe crease brush mainly going to be putting it towards the end and then just blending it out I asked you to do my eyebrows there's a few hairs so that you guys can see and buy again and just make neater this is an amazing trick if you're trying to grow your eyebrows out then cause you know the knee because it looks like dry rather than you when they've got you also we can see that I like to go in this area because I just always want up at foundational I always seem to forget to put it there and then it way I take pictures it's just like this like just actual where foundations drop so I like to put it there and then dab it with my view blender so normally I would then move on to eyes but for school I just thought as shouldn't really be much going on with the eyes I would just use a bit of a scale wrap maybe I line up but right now I've got eyelash extensions in and my friend Regina says them I will put her Instagram somewhere somewhere so we're here and I also encouraged to band below so I'm loving these right now like I can literally wake up in the morning and just like I really need makeup right out I'm going to move on to foundation I'm going to be using the NARS sheer glow this isn't a sudra cause there's probably is going to be a bit too light for me but I'll darken up I white to use Narsha glow because it's it's buildable but it can be as sheer as you want a nice the school it's like no makeup makeup so you want to look done but you don't want look overly done so I think Nasia Belle is a really good foundation for that because it's like perfect they're looking quite natural but also having that bit of coverage I also am a fan of the do I look so I like this foundation on line I've got put primer on but usually I would use a primer especially for days like school because especially if I was going to school just because like you're at school for like eight hours and you won't really have time to like touch up and stuff so I would use the benefit Porefessional futile day - I'll use the Porefessional primer but I've forgotten about that so I'm just going to carry on just going to get my Beauty Blender and go over the just make yourself Linda bindi and then I'm going to use concealer I'm just going to use the same urban decay concealer put it underneath my eyes to avoid the creasing that I was on about I'm going to say it with my Laura Mercier translucent powder I'm not going to bake or anything like that I'm just going to dust it want to do that as soon as you cut your if you're prone to crease in you want to do that as soon as you put the concealer on I'm using the RO Techniques contour brush to put underneath my eyes I'm just going to write just fit revaruraa minutes remaining okay I'm going to quickly dust this Mac bronzing powder this is matte bronze I'm going to use the cheat brush by Real Techniques and just just dust it about anywhere really there's no particular place there's no like real contouring it's just one tool of the face a little bit it I think that highlining highlighting is a fairly important in this look because I think highlight in looks natural ish I can make a huge difference to what your makeup looks like so I'm going to use this all over blow by Topshop this is a liquid illuminator I'm going to use this on my cheekbones I'm just going to put on a cheap eyes but now I'm going to use this buffing brush by Real Techniques and I'm gonna start blending and then as I'm blending I sort of just like randomly whatever was there put it in other places I don't know if the camera picks this up but it does work lovely forehead I'm just gonna get my Uganda and we'll just blend it out a bit cuz it my forehead so dehydrated it just is so rubbish with makeup products it just doesn't seem to blend of stuff so I've used that and then I'm going to use a fan brush and use my mary-lou manizer by the balm go fi fan brush and put on my cheekbones just got my nose I'm also gonna take this is what I don't know what this is it's just a random that little brush put it in the inner corners of my eyes brow bone thank you good bye once I've put that on I like to spray on my face with but Mac prep and prime fix plus again because because that highlighter powder once you spray this it tends to turn into I don't know how to explain it it just doesn't look like powder anymore it doesn't look dusty it just looks glowing so maybe that's set and then it starts to start eternal glowing is that a powdery you can if you want use a bit of blush are I'm going to use this color pop blush up this is called prenup and this is a satin blusher I'm going to use my duo fiber brush by Real Techniques and just just a little bit this gizmo cheese little bit of color a director's pick it up is this okay to finish the lips I'm going to use this color pop lippy stick this is in the color brick this is a matte color and then just for the sim and they're like to spread it around my finger just so it looks more natural and if you want I love lip glosses so I'm going to use this Charlotte Tilbury lip gloss in seduction just in the center and that is literally it for my makeup I don't think I was too much to it I don't think it was too hard I hope that you guys learn something from it I think it looks like natural this is as natural as I would go so this is just my take on natural ish makeup also if I was going back to school I would wear my hair like this I think it looks really good it I'm gonna put cake in my hair up and increase slow for my chunky if you haven't subscribe subscribe already like share favorite do it everyone comment

more feet I actually was their first affiliate I don't know if you guys remember I'm sure some of you do um the video like over a year ago last August I believe and I held up all their eyeshadows and I was like I found these eyeshadows in there two dollars and they even know who I was they reached out to me and they thanked me for that video and a shout-out and then they told me that they wanted to build an affiliate program and they made me their first affiliate actually um because I was just so know what their products so I stand behind morphe I love their products they are Bob I don't think there's anyone out there that doesn't they do and gives you the quality they give you with the inexpensive price point like it's incredible honest to god and you see so many people raving about morphe not because anyone is getting paid you guys you see it because the products are good especially for the price if these products were hundreds of dollars I think it's a ripoff but these are so inexpensive and the quality is so not inexpensive like it's just good stuff honest to god and really the owners of this company are so amazing it's a company it's honestly a company that I want to give my money to the owners are a true rags to riches story they are a brother and sister who have come from nothing and made everything on their own they're so incredible and every youtuber or blogger who has had the opportunity to meet them just falls in love with them as people it's just they're an amazing amazing brand with great values they give back their charitable they're kind they're humble they're just great people and so it's a company that I want to work with it's company that I want to give my money to because they're just an amazing company so I expect to inform you on that you never know there's a lot of shady people out there there's more shady people in business and there are honest people so when I come across honest people I'm like I'm right or die for them and one of those brands they're honest good hard-working people okay so now that you got that backstory on more feet let's jump into the video I know I can talk very quickly so because of that I am going to put every brush I talked about I'm going to put the number down here on the screen so you guys can see it somewhere because I know if I'm like this is the he thought before or you're gonna get wait what did you guys so I'm gonna put everything on the screen I've been talking about it so that you can see with your own eyes the name of the brush so there's no confusion hopefully that will help say no I can talk very quickly in start to ramble so let's get started it is very hard to narrow down my favorites but I did it and I feel like right here these are like my substantial brushes and I'm like yes I use these all the time I love them I'm right or die I'm gonna bring any brushes into this collection I was kind of like I kind of like it these are all brushes I'm like I love them so that is where we're at right now if you get the opportunity to go to the actual morphe store in Burbank California do not turn opportunity down it is literally brush heaven they have probably a hundred and fifty different brushes and they're just lined up all over the walls it is so overwhelming but in the most beautiful wedding possible so the first brush I'm going to talk about is the foundation brush and this is one of my favorite foundation brushes ever and you guys know that because for about what four or five months this is the only foundation brush that I use and I force myself to use other ones now because it's just so repetitive but this is the m43 nine I'm gonna have to look at the numbers because I'm not going to I don't have these memorized um this is the m43 9 brush what makes this brush so amazing to me is the fact that I can use less product and get more coverage if that makes sense as opposed to using like a damp Beauty Blender this takes like half of your product this does not steal your product because of its short synthetic density it takes a little bit of foundation and it really spreads it out on the face so one like this which is the tarte kabuki brush this one steals a lot of product because it has longer bristles so what applies a more sheer coverage which is really nice and i love it but i do use more foundation when i'm using this brush and i use less foundation just like a little bit when i'm using this one and it spreads it further around the face and doesn't steal as much product that's why i love this so much and i just feel like it's the perfect size not too tiny or too fat and just me everything so even and beautiful this is one of my all-time favorites right here I want to talk about four different brushes from the Ely collection and as you can tell by the name elite it's a more high-end luxurious collection by morphe but still extremely reasonably priced they say their price point is much higher because these brushes are more elite and more like luxurious but still they're like a quarter of the price of a mac brush so they're still very wallet friendly on the first I'm going to talk about is just my this is my baby and this is the e4 right here that's the way the Ely collection goes at E 1 2 3 4 because elite so e 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so on this is the blush brush it's technically a contour brush I personally like contouring with angled brushes like this this is what I use for blush and what I love and appreciate so much about this is everyone always wants to make their blush brushes and a natural goat hair and I do not like applying blush with a natural goat hair I think that it can make it go on kind of patchy to go back and get so much blush because it doesn't apply it properly this is like the most perfect blush brush in the world like I wish I made it myself it's so good like I just feel like it was meant for me like it is all my dreams come true in a blush brush I never think I'm gonna use another blush brush again I have no desire to try one someone could tell me you have to try this blush brush it's the best in the world I did mmm sorry you tell nothing but lies this is the best next one we have here is the e 34 and as you can see this one is just like a nice basic brush it's nice and round it's pretty short but it's not too short so it's not too dense what I like to use this for is blending out my bronzer I will show you the brushes that I initially fie bronzer with you can totally apply bronzer with this just right on the face perfect but I do things just a little bit different way in my routine and this is the blush brush that I will use once things are put on the face and maybe it's looking a little choppy maybe just a little unblended I will go over everything with this brush and just kind of blend everything out it's a really great just face blending brush if you need to blend out your contour your blush whatever it may be it's just one of those perfect sized round dome shape synthetic brushes that just blends everything out nice and smooth now we have the ìiî and this one is kind of a fat guy press out like this it gets nice and chubby but if you go like this it gets a little bit more thin and it goes up to this taper which I love and this is what I use where is my powder wait where's my powder seriously this one I use with the Laura Mercier translucent powder I use this to set my whole face is just nice and smooth and it applies powder very lightweight because we have this tapered miss right here you have bristles that are all different lengths and that will make things be applied very surely as opposed to a brush like this little pack things on it's all about the brush lengths that really like determine how your powder will be applied so that's why I use this brush for a nice loose powder because it will apply it really smoothly and softly and won't make it like patch up and then when you take flash photography all of a sudden you've got like white spots on your face this keeps everything nice and smooth so just great all over the face powder brush this bad boy oh my gosh I love is brush so much this one is actually a new one that I just grabbed from like my pile of like new brushes I actually have three of these though because I love this so much I'll tell you why this is the e one actually my face this is that you wanted as you can see it's really fat and it's really dense like it's really really chubby I'm gonna teddy - it feels very heavy weight and luxurious um believe it or not my favorite thing to use this brush for is actually applying tanner to my body um if you've seen my tanning routine I will leave it down below for you guys know has at the end of this video but I will um you see that like I edition I initially start off with this and I use this brush now I use this one actually the past three times I've applied tanner my body I've use this on my entire body and I haven't used a mint I literally just use this because it's so big in fat and it gets the job done so quick and so smooth because it's synthetic the honest-to-god this is my favorite way to apply some mascara now the other way that I will use this is if I do my foundation and I haven't tan in a while my foundation is too dark and I have like a line right here I will take some Ron's err on this brush and I will supply some of it and kind of bring it down to another thing I use this for so basically I use this as a body brush but if you are a powder girl if you like powder foundation and you want a full coverage this would be your go-to right here if you want sheer coverage I would do this if you want a full coverage this right here will get the job done an applier powder-like done so now for contour brush it I have to contour slash bronzer we're going to go through both of them and this one is the m5 two three oh my god I love those lines Oh much it is the most amazing contour brush I think I use it on camera for the first time maybe maybe I'm telling lies I'm not really quite sure so don't quote me on that I love this this is my go-to contour brush now because it's not too skinny um the NARS eita brush I'm not comparing anything but the NARS II to brush you guys know I've been ride or die for this for several years and I still absolutely love it but the one thing that I've heard other people complain about is that once they put the line on their face kind of difficult to blend that line out and I get it you have to really like be kind of careful with the way you apply it and you do that that this brush you don't have to worry about that because of the density again it's tapered we have shorter bristles down here and then it goes up to longer bristles that makes it so that when you put this on it doesn't create this harsh lines you can't blend out it makes it really easy to blend out your contour and it's not like a drag queen contour where it's like extremely cut off it makes it nice and soft in a more natural like can K contour I can't believe I this reference Kim K next one is basically a bigger fatter daddy version of this one like they pretty much have the same shape almost but this one is just like King Kong and this one 20 so this is the five to seven brush I love this for bronzing I would not consider this a contour brush though but it's an amazing bronzing brush I love it it gets on so quick and so beautifully I have been loving the where where am I I'm Norris here we go I have been loving it this luminous bronze light um bronzer from hourglass recently and I use this brush to apply I just go in like this tap it off and I just apply it all over the face like that I love it it just makes it so smooth because like I said I love applying bronzer with natural hairs for some reason blush and other areas of face I like a synthetic brush but bronzer I really really like the more natural hairs to apply it because it just makes it so natural looking and so smooth and bronze are something that I do not want to apply too generously otherwise it can go real quick and that's what the go hair will prevent it'll apply less products and make it less more smooth and more blendable so that's why I love this brush ok this brush I cannot live without I will make a bronzer slash contour blush highlight baking video I see the request to that so I will do that soon I'm just trying to get through like all the holiday videos but this brush you'll see me use it in that video this is the end four five nine brush you see me use this whenever I bake in my videos and I just like go like this you can see this powder on it right now and I stamp out the area that I really want to chisel that's what I love for this so much I've never actually used this for contour you can see off my Laura Mercier powder in there but I've never actually just a contour because it's too harsh I would not like the way this contours I can just tell but it is like perfection for carving out your contour so if you're sloppy is good to go yesterday my friend mica was here and her bronzer was kind of all over the place at the end of the day and not looking sharp not looking clean so I literally just grabbed this brush it went boo boo boo boo Boop and then just wiped it off and it looked nice and tight and clean again that's what I love about this brush such a great method and it's such a great brush to do that method with you guys see me use this brush in every video oh my goodness gracious this is the for 3/8 and I use this one to set my under eye area no matter what I'm setting it with no matter what powder this is the brush I use and I also use it to clean up down here any of the powder that I'm applying until I set the chin area I use set a forehead with highlight like whatever I am doing is like a lighter powder this is what I use to do that it's a great brush it applies things nice and gently again because you have the tapered area the shorter brushes that go to the longer ones and it's just such a great brush Sigma has one that's like the exact same pretty much right here this is their like gold collection it's like the exact same brush but the morphe ones just cheaper ah this is my baby this is the Evan 501 brush that's the only brush that I actually have to look in the numbers I just know I've talked to my head um this is the brush that I use for highlighting it's not technically a highlight brush I don't remember what they technically marketed as but soon as I got it I was this is perfection for highlighting and it's what I have used ever since I use a lot of other brushes for highlight and like I test them out like if people send me a brush in the mail or send me things to try on my first year I tried I'm like this is just it I always go and end up grabbing this one and applying my highlight with this brush because I just feel like it applies it nice and gentle gentle nice and gently and smooth and I just get the outcome that I desire I don't get too much and I go don't get too little so the m500 one my favorite highlight brush I get asked this all the time this is it right here buy more feet now we're going to move on to rushes and the first one I want to talk about is actually the first brush that I would go in with when doing any I look like the one I did today this is what I use or smokey eye this is the first brush that I'll recommend going in with and this is the morphe and obviously you buy morphe Jaqueline get it together this is the m4 for one rush so you would take up your lightest transition shade and then just go ahead and apply it right here in that transition area and if you're wondering what the transition area is it's the space between your eyelid and your brow bone right there you would put a really light color and that's going to be the transition to when you're doing any I look that's going to kind of fade out the transition from like heavy eye to nothing so that's the brush that I would use for that area is a natural hair so it applies it really nice and soft and smooth it doesn't like put on like a dense amount because you don't want that when you're working high up in this area this brush was created for this high up area and keeping it nice and smooth so I'm four for one this one is a ride-or-die can't live without this brush this is my absolute favorite I rush all-time and this is the M 4-3-3 brush I talk about this in a favorites video a few months back I have a couple of these because I just I'm constantly using this brush for everything this is the most like multi functional brush that I own because you can pack stuff on all of the live with this you can blend it out you can go hide in the low and go under the eye you can do anything with this so the M 4-3-3 has is my favorite eye shadow brush by morphe but what I use this one for typically and as you see in all my tutorials I use this brush every single time is packing on a color and the outer crease because of the shape again you have shorter bristles out here and then barely longer ones in the center ever so slightly so it's not too intense but it just makes it so that applies it so smoothly and it's so easy to blend out it's just such a good brush it's such a freakin good brush and then if you don't have products on it yes I'm using my leggings no judgement if you get the product off of your brush it makes a great brush to also apply up higher and the transition area as well it's just shorter and a little bit more denser than the original one that I talked about so you can see the difference sorry we're out of focus you can see the difference right there this one would supply a little less product and this one applies a little more which is why I initially like to go in with this one the m4 for one and then go in with the m4 3 3 next we have the e 22 this is a part of the elite collection since it has the e in front of it and is synthetic this one is really different and I love that about it so this one goes up to a nice taper as you can see very short bristles on the side to get longer and longer longer to a nice pointed taper which is great for when you're doing something right in this crease so if you want to add depth and you want to keep it low and you want to make sure that it doesn't go up too high into that transition area one like this might not be your best friend if you're working in that area and you want to keep it precise because it is so fluffy which is what I love about it because it blends everything out so nicely but this one on the other hand it doesn't blend it out as much but it keeps it nice and low and tight so now I have four smaller brushes more like precision brushes which I absolutely cannot live without precision brushes I feel like are something that can be really overlooked in the brush community but for me personally they're just as important as the blending brushes to get nice and precise on an eye look and the first one is the M 3 2 1 I love this for packing on it dark colors so sometimes like if you want to get something really nice and tight like low in this area the outer corner sometimes when you're using brushes like this they're a little too big and you feel like you can't get it right you can't get it like as dark as you want it to be because they're they're big and they're more for like the crease area this brush that's where this comes in and is the star of the show it picks up so much products and gets it so tight and dense on that eye and makes it so dark it's so amazing and because of the fact that it is synthetic and it's not a natural hair it puts so much product on your actual lid and makes it nice and dark which I actually love this brush for that this is not a pencil brush though don't get it confused it's nice and rounded but I would not use this really for blending out the lower lash line unless you have no products on this and you already put products on there and you're just blending it out with this being completely bare then you could use it but I really wouldn't use this as a pencil brush don't use it more for packing on hoping that make sense but speaking of pencil brushes this is the e 18 and this is a great pencil brush you guys have seen use this many times you guys see me use all these many times let's get real this one is really really nice for blending things out it is a little bit of a longer pencil brush so when you're packing like the color on the brush what I do is I make sure not to let let my brush go side to side otherwise you're going to get all the products on the side when using a pencil brush just make sure you go do poop like that to get the products on just up and down and maybe a little swirl and then tap off the excess you don't want to go like this otherwise if you get on the side and now it's going to be sloppy so when you're blending out your lower lash line just boop-boop into the product and then go in and begin just to blend using just the tip of it and that's how you'll get that really nice smooth smoked out lash line and for smoking out that lash line this is the most important brush I physically could not do my makeup without this brush I use it every day and this is the m43 to and it's just a flat definer brush it's completely and totally flat as you can see on the top nice and tight this is the brush that I go in with my blacks my dark brown my dark purples whatever it may be and get nice and tight what is on my face and get nice and tight on that lower lash line to make it get right in there and then I will go in and blend it out with a pencil brush such as this one right here this one is also amazing for like smoking out your top liner you guys have seen me do that a million times or if you're doing a more neutral natural look you can take that the dark brown this brush and just use that strictly for your eyeliner and put it right on your lash line you can also put this underneath of your lashes right here kind of darken up the lash area and kind of tight line these little definer brushes are just so amazing and I just love them so much I can't do my makeup without definer brushes and this one believe it or not is my favorite definer brush I think of all time um this is the e36 again it's from their elite collection it's the last brush so I have to talk about and when I start using this I was like how have I ever gone through my life without this little brush right here this is what I use to highlight my inner corner and it is so perfect once you have a brush like this to highlight the inner corner of your eyes you're just like what am I ever supposed to use ever again like this is the inner corner Queen right here it's just so perfect to get in there and highlight and not make it too messy because with an inner corner highlight if you're using Frost like I do like Mac nylon eyeshadow if you get that down here too far like in this area now it looks like you have bags and if you get it too close to the nose and now it's too much you want that inner corner highlight to be nice and precise and that's what I love about this brush so much so that's it you guys gonna get power to that video like I really hope that you guys enjoy this these are my all-time absolute favorite morphe brush loveable absolute very morphe brushes um at the moment I of course have other ones right here that I really enjoy as well but these are like my ride-or-die homeys for life so if you guys need a June updated one down the road you know like five or six months from now I will totally do another one I'm sure um but at the moment these are like my bitches that I can't live without so I hope you guys enjoy this video

including their eyeshadow palettes and their eyeshadow palettes are bomb their eyeshadow palettes are better than their singles in my opinion like your two dollar singles I think the palettes are better the palettes keep getting higher and better quality and they are so good so impressive so that's it you guys I love you I hope that you guys enjoy this video and I will see you in the next couple of days within a mega tutorial that I'm so excited so yeah that's it I love you guys and I'll talk to you soon bye thank you so much this is a page what is so that I like it so sweet so sugar that you can your eyes you take a sit your crunching on sugar that's disgusting haired go oh now I'm gonna go ahead and talk about the I Russians that I picked out I have to sneeze uh nevermind alright I get that confuse at the sneeze when you have lipstick on does anyone else drink like this next we have the e 22 and this is a part of the elite collection since I had to be in front of it that's how you know that's how you know he loves you oh my gosh you see Georgie he just sat down and stuff scooted his ass across the floor George what's wrong you got a problem with the Moody I know the e1 makes a bomb-ass microphone just saying every time in front of the mirror and I'm getting I Christina Aguilera on my you don't even know send a little oval round don't you better get this bar two and a half weeks because I'm not with those youtubers who has my act together like let's get real I can hear you always I've been ninja you always forget thishey guys today's makeup look is a very simple look that I personally like to wear whenever I'm wearing a very bold lip because it really makes the lip color stand out and today I'm going to show you with brown lips which I personally have been loving lately so if you guys want to know how to get this really simple look then please keep watching after the awkward posing brought to you by yours truly thank you I hate posing so freakin much so I'm starting off with nothing on my skin I am using my L'Oreal infallible Pro matte foundation and I'm in thick coloured caramel beige I like to apply this with either a brush or my fingers and then I take my damp sponge with two drops of my purse all eight rolls elixir and I really belong this out onto my skin as you guys know who've been watching my past few videos you guys probably sick of this routine but I love it I really suggest you guys try it out it is amazing for my concealer today I'm using this one from Marc Jacobs to be honest I don't really recommend this concealer please don't waste your money on it like I did because it will crease on you and it will crease bad I had to learn the hard way I wore this concealer a couple times and then by the end of the night I was like why do I look like a melted candle what is going on under my eye and then I realized that it was this concealer which made me really sad because I love everything else in the Marc Jacobs Beauty line all the products are such high-quality I talk about them all the time but this one just really missed the mark for my contour today I'm using the Tom Ford shade and illuminate which is a life holy grail for me I love this I will continue the purchases for the rest of my life and I'm just using the same brush that I applied my concealer with because I'm lazy like that I just wiped it off on a paper towel and then went through with the contour oh hey creepy contoured face so now I'm just going to blend out my contour first I'm using this brush from zoeva which is my favorite contour blending brush ever it blends it out so seamlessly and I feel like it's like the perfect thickness the perfect density the perfect everything so I just blending out the contour first I personally probably would not contour and highlight at the same time again I just wanted to try something different and it's not a method that I enjoy I like to do one thing at a time I my food like that too like I eat one thing at a time and I don't know why that's relevant to this tutorial but yeah the more you know about me I guess so now I'm just blending out the highlighter with my damp sponge and by highlighter I mean my concealer now I'm just going to go through and set that concealer in place I'm using my Marc Jacobs insta mark light filtering powder and I'm using the yellowish shade just to set the centers of my face and my under eye and I'm going pretty heavy with setting this concealer in place because like I said earlier it does crease on you heart break emoji here so now I'm just going to go through and bronze my face I'm using the chocolate Soleil bronzer from Too Faced and this is indie color milk chocolate I think I'll have it in the description box below I got this as a point part from so forums been lasting forever and then for my blush today I'm using this one from Mac I think it's called sweet as cocoa but again I'll have the name in the description box below for my highlighter today I'm using one of my favorites ever and this is by Becca and this is called opal and this is a really nice pinky it's not only pink it's like a champagne color but it has less golden and in which I personally like whenever I'm wearing a really deep lip color and I just like this with brown lips in general so really going ham on the globe because I love me some glow now I'm moving on to the eyebrows look at that highlighter MA - my favorite filling in my eyebrows with my own associate Brahmas indeed color evany and I'm just filling in my brows how I normally fill in my eyebrows I was not having a good bra day this day as you can tell huh kept messing them up and then I'm going to set them in place with by anastasiya clear brow gel for my eyes today I'm just going to blend out whatever concealer may be on my lid and I'm taking this color from my Kat Von D shade and light palette love this palette it's a definite must-have and I'm just applying a wash of this all over my entire lid this is just going to neutralize the lid it has the slightest shimmer it's not really a shimmer it's a satin finish I shadow I love the way this eye shadow looks I wear this eye shadow all the time and I said eyeshadow like eight million times now I'm grabbing the matte black on my favorite angled brush ever this is the 263 from Mac and I'm lining my lash line with this and flicking it up and smoking it out and I'm creating a very elongated wing with this this is my favorite eyeliner look to where I feel like it's so flattering for everybody and it's it's foolproof you cannot mess this eyeliner up and if you do it's okay because it's just shadow and you can just wipe it right away as opposed to like a gel liner a liquid liner so try this out and love it and I love the Kat Von D eye shadow because it's so black and so pigmented so I just like to build up that color and smoke it out now I'm taking my NARS via veneto eyeliner this is just a black and I'm applying this to my tight line this is just to thicken up the lash line and make my lashes look thicker and darker and who doesn't like nice dark lashes for my mascara today I'm using a new favorite which is the Marc Jacobs velvet noir mascara I've been using a lot of Marc Jacobs in this video Marc Jacobs I've just been loving the last little while all of the makeup from their line this mascara is beautiful but it does flake a little which I don't like for the price but I mean I love the way it makes my lashes look so I'm okay with a little bit of flaking I'm also applying this on my lower lashes to open up the eyes and I'm not putting anything on my lower lash line because I really want the focus of this look to be that beautiful cat winged the glowing skin and that chocolate brown lip for my lip color today I'm using the Kylie lip kit in the color true Brown Kay I'm using the liquid lipstick first and then I'm going through with the lip liner that comes in the kit to fix my lip shape so just a little side note these lip kits were not sent to me I paid for them with my very own money and they sold out so quick I'm surprised I was even able to get them but my honest review of these I was not expecting them to be as good as they are I was so pleasantly surprised when I tried them on i was like whoa this is probably the most comfortable high quality liquid lipstick i have

cream and this is from the body shop and I love this stuff it's so good it gives your skin such a dewy finish if you have dry skin you will love the stuff if you have more of a oily skin you're not going to like it because it gives really good you look very shiny the buffing brush because you have to buffing into your skin and you cannot use this with a Beauty Blender I learned the hard way because there's little beads inside of it that color match your skin tone and if you use a big burner then it won't break why mate why am i smiling I don't know I'm just so happy so happy but yeah you gotta use a buffing brush for this and just buff into your skin I love this stuff it just makes my skin look so healthy and it's very very light coverage next I'm going to be going in with my mac pro long concealer and NC 42 and just applying this in the dark areas of my face like under my eyes and around the corners of my milk next I'm going to be using this useless brush that I thought would work well but it didn't so I kind of just threw that aside and use my Beauty Blender to just blend it all in this is a new camera by the way I'm just still trying to figure out how it works but yeah next I'm going to be taking the Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer it's my favorite and it's in rich bronze it's just so beautiful and it gives your skin the glow that you've always wanted it's just perfect I love the stuff I just came back from Colorado and we went to a target there and they had it so I picked up a few I love it I love it so much and I just I love looking bronze so I kind of just drag that down my neck and just warm up my cheeks I love this stuff so much did I say I love this stuff I love the stuff next I'm going to be using the tray under the bronzer and I'm just going to be blending out my concealer before I set it because it started to crease I'm just going to be going in with banana powder very lightly and just pushing it under my eyes to prevent creasing I'm not really baking at this point I'm just kind of setting my makeup next I'm going to be going in with corduroy and wedge eyeshadow by Mac and I'm going to be contouring my nose now this is the fave my favorite part of of putting on my makeup again I don't wear all this makeup every single day but it's my everyday go-to routine if I have some time on my hands like if I were to wear makeup that day this is what I would usually do so it's my yeah it's my everyday makeup when I have time for makeup you know what I mean next I'm going to be mixing Blount and Peach twists and just warming up my cheeks as well and my go-to blush is a more of a corner I don't know my go-to blush is a more of a coral colored bronzy colored blush that's what I love wearing so I love to warm up my cheeks with that and I'm now I'm just applying a highlighter it's just a regular eyeshadow from Mac I think it's in all that glitters next I'm going to be applying my voluminous mascara and I love this mascara so much but to be honest it's I think it's causing my lashes to fall out and that's not so good so I need to stop using it but I love it what how did that even happen I love it so much so I need to find a really good mascara so if you guys know a really good drugstore mascara list that down below now I'm taking my Ardell 120 lashes now again I don't wear lashes every single day but when I do have time for makeup I love putting these on just by itself with no eye shadow it's very very natural and I kind of just mesh that in with my natural lashes if you want I can do how to wear lashes that wasn't a good example but how to wear lashes video if you guys are interested now I can just cover up the glue with some liquid liner and I'm just applying a very thin layer very very thin layer just to cover the glue of the lashes and to make it look more natural like I'm not weighing this out or anything like that just very lightly putting this on the lash line of my lash line and then dragging that in the corner of my eye yeah you know what time it is it's stripped downtown it's not it's not focusing see I'm still gonna use this camera but um I'd strip down the lip liner nothing else ladies

all the details of what I use and discount codes in the description box thanks for watching ladies byehi guys so I put up this look on Instagram yesterday and a load of you want to see a makeup tutorial I also tweeted if you guys want to see this look and those of you said yes so I'm I've just realized my stalkers and so I don't yes it is okay in fact what I was saying so many of you wanted makeup tutorials so I'm here doing a makeup story for you guys it's really like dole I can it's just just a look that I would totally go for a lot of it so I hope you guys enjoy the mini pop tutorial if you want to see this book thank you for watching okay so I've already moisturized my skin I used a clean dramatically different moisturizing cream for very dry to dry skin I'm gonna start off with my brows I could normally do I'm just gonna brush through them I'm gonna use my Mac eye brow pencil in spiked so I follow the natural shape I already have and then it's sort of just build from that shape so I don't really have an arch here but I just create one with what I do have and I always keep brushing through I'm gonna do an update your brow routine like a proper in-depth how I do my brows we okay and then I'm going to use my Alice's your Beverly Hills brow powder in Ebony I'm going to use the Anastasia Beverly Hills it's like a brow brush like suppose because it's quite fully and then it's got this angle fit and this is number 12 and I'm just gonna shade in where there's random gaps I prefer to do this with a powder because it makes it look more natural rub than like coloring it in with pencil I just find it just looks far better when I do this rather than doing it with a bull pencil okay and then I'm going to conceal my brows I conceal with the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer my shade is it's come up so I can't say what my shade is I think it was medium dark something like that and I normally use this but I'm a little bit more tan for this now so I mix it with the Make Up For Ever full cover concealer just for the color and actually you don't really try this on its own I probably should but I just mix these two together on the back of my hand this is just to clean up any areas it's a really good trick to do if you're like in the middle of I grow in your brows then doesn't look so ridiculous unless someone goes really close to your face but like then you could like be it why you so close I mean I feel good notice the hairs and you to close well the rest of the concealer that's on the back of my hand I like to go in these bits in my eyes just because I always do my eyes before I do my foundation and then when I do my foundation I could get to put em product here and then when I go to take like flash photos and stuff I can like see where I've missed it and it just gets ridiculous I'm going to prime eyelid with Emma decay primer potion as per usual I'm actually looking for a new primer and not fair not for any particular reason I like that prime um but I like to try new products and stuff apparently the NARS primer is really good but they can really get there I'm also going to prime my face with my Jacobs primer now I did a snapchat rant about this and saying how much I didn't really really like it I didn't see the high value and I did try for quite a few times and I just didn't like it but I ended up trying it again just because I just I like to give products a try I tried it again and like ah I really really liked it I personally think it has something to do with the weather change I didn't really particularly in summer and then while it was cooling down they were still good weather I didn't really like it now that it's winter my skin is a lot drier and I feel like this is like perfect for dry skin because before it made my skin really oily but it is working like a dream right now that is autumn or fall and you wanna call and see I kind of take back what I said I like to pry my face while I'm doing my eyes just to put it good and absorb and stuff and I like on to the eyes so I'm mainly going to be you I'm going to be using this palette and it's just a customized palette from Mac and I saw I just put these four in this particular about it um I'm gonna be using Omega and I'm gonna be using on a Mac - to avoid any one of these because it's just crusty right now this is going to be like a transition show so there's really not much color to it at all but it's just something that the other colors can blend into so this is just going to go in the crease there's really not much color to it at all and that's going to take my Mac 217 and I'm going to mix it mix these two colors together oh this one is blackberry and this one is expresso my brush is kind of dirty I used it in this color yesterday they're still gonna come out the same so blackberry an expresso mix them - to get on a 217 and go right in the crease with this I mix the blackberry color because this look is quite pinkish and so you don't want it to be like a solid round in the color you want going to be a theme tone some sort of purple or some sort of pink I feel like it complements the pink in the lids way for the lid I'm going to be using this Joey the brush it's just a flat brush you wanna have it as a flat brush because you want to Pat color on and I'm going to be using this color this is yogurt by Mac it is a matte pink color and then it blend the crease out again I thought only thing that the leaves were pink enough yesterday so I'm going to use my toothpaste acknowledge the age of line leave my Too Faced and chocolate bar palette I'm not sure what the color on bit about use is called but then use this pink here this pallets mind it's a little white as I'm going to call my eyelashes ask our amusement of what's your type mascara buy the farm this is the tall dark and handsome one I love this mascara a lot okay so I'm going to use some eyelashes I know she's I'm using are the Lily lashes mine are not in there because I use them yesterday but they look like yes they are fabulous these are in Monaco and I'm saying that right okay so you want to do this as close to the lash line as you possibly can do it because there's not going to be eyeliner so as close as possible I actually this makes me nervous because it just does okay here we go I always put them in the middle first and then I arranged the outer edge you leave them to dry no your foundation now I'm going to use any foundation that I have not used before let's start off by using my favorite foundation brush which is the joy everyone mentioned a couple times now and I'm going to be using the Born This Way two-faced foundation my shade is honey add notes about this foundation so I'm just going to - I don't know Modi why normally do and just do it around with face seems like a good color match so that's okay I kind of matched it myself sayo risky risky time okay I get I am the most nervous person when you come to try foundations new ones because I just hadn't got you home foundation brush to step up and listen you guys are the first to see me try this foundation it's quite exciting yeah just one there and it sounds quite good and I can break down my neck it's a good kind of match but I always do this anyway time for concealer I'm gonna use my Bobbi Brown corrector first in darky I'm gonna go on do my eyes with this one of my eyes I'm going to be using the amazing concealer then I'm using the amazing concealer in tan golden and blend it out a to set that way the reviews in my Laura Mercier translucent powder and another and on G thingy and let tap that underneath my own I like to do this as soon as I put concealer on because it avoids the crease iam and I get a lot of grease in do while that is baking I'm going to use my mac mineralize foundation in nw15 this is to contour arm using my body shop brush and this is a blusher brush and notice going around my forehead first I'm going to ask the rest of this power rock because I just look mental and I'm gonna use my contour brush by Real Techniques and I'm not pressing down hard so it's really like that really live streams if fly-in is driving me insane like the jet inside actually I'm going to go crazy finish off my eyes real quick before I finish up some phase I'm going to go back into these two colors that vary in expresso and go underneath my eyes losing the to seven teams codifies which is like my favorite brush and then did underneath the eyes I'm going to take my Mac my Mac to 198 don't hold me on that it's just a micro pencil brush ok so I'm going to use my L matte eyeshadow in it so just a white color but I don't know if this is still available but just get a white and that white I've never used a map in a quarter before but I think I don't know it's really good and then mascara on the bottom lashes I'm going to use the same mascara by the bar on the tall dark and handsome one also going to use a nude eyeliner this is a mister right now eyeliner pencil by the balm this colours quick dry and I believe he's just going to grow more on this creates that dough like I finished off the face I'm going to take my labelled um brush I
