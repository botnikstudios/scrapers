hi everyone so this tutorial is going to be how to recreate the look that Samina Gomez wore for her performance at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show you guys are always asking me if I will create some Selena Gomez makeup looks for you and I absolutely love the votes it the look that she wore for the fashion show it was a really warm bronzy smoky eye with glitter on it at least when the camera like pinned and on her it definitely looked like she had some chunky glitter going on so I definitely wanted to put that on the look too and she was wearing blue contacts which I think just kind of made her look a little bit different I'm wearing green contacts but because the both of us have really dark dark brown eyes I feel like the effect is still pretty similar even though hers were technically blue and wintergreen I think it still looks really similar and yeah so if you guys are interested in seeing how I recreated this look then please keep watching so I am starting off with eye primer I'm using lorac behind the scenes eyeshadow primer we're going to be priming our eyelids first because they're going to be working with glitter and you don't want that to fall onto your base taking this midtone pink called soulful from the egg cosmetics naturally pretty palette I'm working this into the crease of my eye with a fluffy blending brush this is going to be our transition shade it just gives a look a lot of overall warmth taking this gel liner from colour-pop in the shade sweet tooth I am taking my finger I'm just patting this onto my eyelids it is going to be a base for the next shadow that we use taking pokerface from makeup geek this is a pigment I picked this up on a flat shadow brush and patted this directly on top of sweet tooth and as you guys can see it just helps that pigment really stick and look even more metallic and Selena's shape of her shadow was a little bit catty so I am bringing this into the outer corner and it's not perfect but I'm giving it a little bit of sharpness on the edge like you guys can see I'm definitely giving it a caddy shape now for the glitter this is gorgeous Cosmetics glitter in the shade Oscar I picked this up directly on my fingertip with a little bit of duo eyelash glue and I just patted this directly onto my lid naina definitely had a little bit of chunky glitter going on and it looked so beautiful when it would flash in the lights and the camera was panned in closely to her eyes it just made her eyes sparkle it was so amazing to clean up fall out I took a Neutrogena makeup wipe and it picked up the glitter fine if you're having an extra hard time with the glitter that you are using then you can use some tape and that will just pick that up right off your face I'm priming my face with angel veil from NYX for my base I mix visa for illuminating drops in morning light with Dr Starr Foundation while I said that really good your star foundation and I applied this to my face with a flat top kabuki from hair and makeup addiction you taking Maybelline instant age rewind in the shades medium and newtralizer I am using my fingertips and I'm just applying this right under the eye to conceal and highlight and I put a little bit on the nose and keep it slow but I wanted to keep it overall true to the Victoria's Secret look because selena was definitely looking really natural and dewy so I wanted to keep the highlighting and contouring a little bit more light handed I set everything with the Kogan doe uh translucent light reflecting powder my fast she is I believe how you say it and I set the concealer foundation everything with this because like I said I didn't want the concealer to be too stark and highlighted and then I contoured my face just lightly with macchiato from Anastasia Beverly Hills contour where I typically do around the hairline under the cheekbones sides of the nose jawline you know the drill and to bronze my skin I'm taking the Lancome bronzer and just on a big fluffy brush this one is from Sedona lace I'm just lightly giving my face and overall more bronze appearance to fit the victoria secret super bronze look and then I took the poker face pigment from makeup geek once again on a luxe petit crease brush this one's from zoeva and I just smudge this into the lower lash line all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner and then I highlighted the face with champagne pop this is from Becca I picked this up on this tulip bulbs shaped brush from Sedona lace and like I said so you know wasn't super highlighted and contoured so I wanted this to just be really glowing from within eliminated looking so rather than really concentrating the highlight anywhere I worked it all over the whole face and then I was having a hard time my eyes were watering from the contacts but then I took this brown liner from Sigma in the shade balance and I work back into my waterline I'm going behind myself cool then I took the ICO fat liquid liner and I did thick dramatic wings because Selena had a very dramatic liquid cat eye going on I used Smashbox x-rated mascara on my top and bottom lashes I did do one coat of waterproof mascara but I'm doing the bulk of mascara with Smashbox x-rated this is sesame blush from gorgeous cosmetics I think this looks just like whatever saline I was wearing it's a very orange II terracotta warm blush so for lashes I used s kiddo desire I have one used so many times and I don't have the box anymore but I will link them down below if you guys they're very dramatic and she definitely had lots of lashes going on and then I just wiped my lip balm off with a makeup like to get started with a nice dry base and I am applying sore this is a Mac lip pencil and then just lightly outlining my lips for a little bit of definition or the color I am using hobbies like math for me I was running a light fleshie of kinky nude and I think this looks pretty similar to whatever she had going on her lips were very glossy and I used my favorite lip gloss of all time wedge Russian by buxom and then I finished everything off with a spray of Taco doing luminous skin miss my new absolute favorite that I've been
