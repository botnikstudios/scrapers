hi guys so I put up this look on Instagram yesterday and a load of you want to see a makeup tutorial I also tweeted if you guys want to see this look and those of you said yes so I'm I've just realized my stalkers and so I don't yes it is okay in fact what I was saying so many of you wanted makeup tutorials so I'm here doing a makeup story for you guys it's really like dole I can it's just just a look that I would totally go for a lot of it so I hope you guys enjoy the mini pop tutorial if you want to see this book thank you for watching okay so I've already moisturized my skin I used a clean dramatically different moisturizing cream for very dry to dry skin I'm gonna start off with my brows I could normally do I'm just gonna brush through them I'm gonna use my Mac eye brow pencil in spiked so I follow the natural shape I already have and then it's sort of just build from that shape so I don't really have an arch here but I just create one with what I do have and I always keep brushing through I'm gonna do an update your brow routine like a proper in-depth how I do my brows we okay and then I'm going to use my Alice's your Beverly Hills brow powder in Ebony I'm going to use the Anastasia Beverly Hills it's like a brow brush like suppose because it's quite fully and then it's got this angle fit and this is number 12 and I'm just gonna shade in where there's random gaps I prefer to do this with a powder because it makes it look more natural rub than like coloring it in with pencil I just find it just looks far better when I do this rather than doing it with a bull pencil okay and then I'm going to conceal my brows I conceal with the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer my shade is it's come up so I can't say what my shade is I think it was medium dark something like that and I normally use this but I'm a little bit more tan for this now so I mix it with the Make Up For Ever full cover concealer just for the color and actually you don't really try this on its own I probably should but I just mix these two together on the back of my hand this is just to clean up any areas it's a really good trick to do if you're like in the middle of I grow in your brows then doesn't look so ridiculous unless someone goes really close to your face but like then you could like be it why you so close I mean I feel good notice the hairs and you to close well the rest of the concealer that's on the back of my hand I like to go in these bits in my eyes just because I always do my eyes before I do my foundation and then when I do my foundation I could get to put em product here and then when I go to take like flash photos and stuff I can like see where I've missed it and it just gets ridiculous I'm going to prime eyelid with Emma decay primer potion as per usual I'm actually looking for a new primer and not fair not for any particular reason I like that prime um but I like to try new products and stuff apparently the NARS primer is really good but they can really get there I'm also going to prime my face with my Jacobs primer now I did a snapchat rant about this and saying how much I didn't really really like it I didn't see the high value and I did try for quite a few times and I just didn't like it but I ended up trying it again just because I just I like to give products a try I tried it again and like ah I really really liked it I personally think it has something to do with the weather change I didn't really particularly in summer and then while it was cooling down they were still good weather I didn't really like it now that it's winter my skin is a lot drier and I feel like this is like perfect for dry skin because before it made my skin really oily but it is working like a dream right now that is autumn or fall and you wanna call and see I kind of take back what I said I like to pry my face while I'm doing my eyes just to put it good and absorb and stuff and I like on to the eyes so I'm mainly going to be you I'm going to be using this palette and it's just a customized palette from Mac and I saw I just put these four in this particular about it um I'm gonna be using Omega and I'm gonna be using on a Mac - to avoid any one of these because it's just crusty right now this is going to be like a transition show so there's really not much color to it at all but it's just something that the other colors can blend into so this is just going to go in the crease there's really not much color to it at all and that's going to take my Mac 217 and I'm going to mix it mix these two colors together oh this one is blackberry and this one is expresso my brush is kind of dirty I used it in this color yesterday they're still gonna come out the same so blackberry an expresso mix them - to get on a 217 and go right in the crease with this I mix the blackberry color because this look is quite pinkish and so you don't want it to be like a solid round in the color you want going to be a theme tone some sort of purple or some sort of pink I feel like it complements the pink in the lids way for the lid I'm going to be using this Joey the brush it's just a flat brush you wanna have it as a flat brush because you want to Pat color on and I'm going to be using this color this is yogurt by Mac it is a matte pink color and then it blend the crease out again I thought only thing that the leaves were pink enough yesterday so I'm going to use my toothpaste acknowledge the age of line leave my Too Faced and chocolate bar palette I'm not sure what the color on bit about use is called but then use this pink here this pallets mind it's a little white as I'm going to call my eyelashes ask our amusement of what's your type mascara buy the farm this is the tall dark and handsome one I love this mascara a lot okay so I'm going to use some eyelashes I know she's I'm using are the Lily lashes mine are not in there because I use them yesterday but they look like yes they are fabulous these are in Monaco and I'm saying that right okay so you want to do this as close to the lash line as you possibly can do it because there's not going to be eyeliner so as close as possible I actually this makes me nervous because it just does okay here we go I always put them in the middle first and then I arranged the outer edge you leave them to dry no your foundation now I'm going to use any foundation that I have not used before let's start off by using my favorite foundation brush which is the joy everyone mentioned a couple times now and I'm going to be using the Born This Way two-faced foundation my shade is honey add notes about this foundation so I'm just going to -
