hi everyone so I'm back with a best school makeup tutorial I know it's only like the mentor of August but everyone goes back to school the beginning of September so I just get this video up and get it ready so you guys can pay yourself or going back to school see you home think in the head si si so I said I blabbering on I'm just gonna get them with a tutorial and yeah I hope you guys like it it's already boys drive must commence cleaning dramatically different moisturizing cream this particular one is for very dryer to dry combination skin I love this moisturizer is amazing for moisturizing and I will continue to purchase this forever I've also used this body shop bitter mini ice cream underneath my eyes I find that when I use this and I put concealer on my casino comes out better and I've got a lot of priests in going on under my eyes for a 20 year old I think is ridiculous I have a lot of crease underneath my eyes so I need i green definitely I've also sprayed my face with the Mac prep and prime it fix plus because it's just needed before after during makeup always ever and I've used this a forever ello lips lip balm okay so I'm going to start with brows as per usual I'm going to be using my normal Mac eyebrow pencil in that spiked I'm looking over here because of my mirrors over here obviously its school we don't want to go too harsh with eyebrows because I know what I think of school makeup I just think of it being a fairly light and not much to it but you still made a bit of effort so I'm basically just following my natural eyebrow shape and might create an art whether it is meant to be an arch for my eyebrow justice or it's not to grow you want when you're doing your eyebrows you want to keep brushing it with one of these brushes because then it makes the eyebrow much softer when I get to the front I like to go in the direction of the hairs that are going up so I like to use my eyebrow and so and go up if they're fairly natural I think I think the special that I've ended up so with my eyebrows I like to use concealer under my eyebrows because I just think it looks a lot neater the Urban Decay concealer this is a bit lighter than my skin tone right now but what's woodlands doing this stuff will be fine use my concealer brush by sheer cover I've never fired better a concealer brush then this one I could use in a few years and I blend it with my Real Techniques deluxe crease brush mainly going to be putting it towards the end and then just blending it out I asked you to do my eyebrows there's a few hairs so that you guys can see and buy again and just make neater this is an amazing trick if you're trying to grow your eyebrows out then cause you know the knee because it looks like dry rather than you when they've got you also we can see that I like to go in this area because I just always want up at foundational I always seem to forget to put it there and then it way I take pictures it's just like this like just actual where foundations drop so I like to put it there and then dab it with my view blender so normally I would then move on to eyes but for school I just thought as shouldn't really be much going on with the eyes I would just use a bit of a scale wrap maybe I line up but right now I've got eyelash extensions in and my friend Regina says them I will put her Instagram somewhere somewhere so we're here and I also encouraged to band below so I'm loving these right now like I can literally wake up in the morning and just like I really need makeup right out I'm going to move on to foundation I'm going to be using the NARS sheer glow this isn't a sudra cause there's probably is going to be a bit too light for me but I'll darken up I white to use Narsha glow because it's it's buildable but it can be as sheer as you want a nice the school it's like no makeup makeup so you want to look done but you don't want look overly done so I think Nasia Belle is a really good foundation for that because it's like perfect they're looking quite natural but also having that bit of coverage I also am a fan of the do I look so I like this foundation on line I've got put primer on but usually I would use a primer especially for days like school because especially if I was going to school just because like you're at school for like eight hours and you won't really have time to like touch up and stuff so I would use the benefit Porefessional futile day - I'll use the Porefessional primer but I've forgotten about that so I'm just going to carry on just going to get my Beauty Blender and go over the just make yourself Linda bindi and then I'm going to use concealer I'm just going to use the same urban decay concealer put it underneath my eyes to avoid the creasing that I was on about I'm going to say it with my Laura Mercier translucent powder I'm not going to bake or anything like that I'm just going to dust it want to do that as soon as you cut your if you're prone to crease in you want to do that as soon as you put the concealer on I'm using the RO Techniques contour brush to put underneath my eyes I'm just going to write just fit revaruraa minutes remaining okay I'm going to quickly dust this Mac bronzing powder this is matte bronze I'm going to use the cheat brush by Real Techniques and just just dust it about anywhere really there's no particular place there's no like real contouring it's just one tool of the face a little bit it I think that highlining highlighting is a fairly important in this look because I think highlight in looks natural ish I can make a huge difference to what your makeup looks like so I'm going to use this all over blow by Topshop this is a liquid illuminator I'm going to use this on my cheekbones I'm just going to put on a cheap eyes but now I'm going to use this buffing brush by Real Techniques and I'm gonna start blending and then as I'm blending I sort of just like randomly whatever was there put it in other places I don't know if the camera picks this up but it does work lovely forehead I'm just gonna get my Uganda and we'll just blend it out a bit cuz it my forehead so dehydrated it just is so rubbish with makeup products it just doesn't seem to blend of stuff so I've used that and then I'm going to use a fan brush and use my mary-lou manizer by the balm go fi fan brush and put on my cheekbones just got my nose I'm also gonna take this is what I don't know what this is it's just a random that little brush put it in the inner corners of my eyes brow bone thank you good bye once I've put that on I like to spray on my face with but Mac prep and prime fix plus again because because that highlighter powder once you spray this it tends to turn into I don't know how to explain it it just doesn't look like powder anymore it doesn't look dusty it just looks glowing so maybe that's set and then it starts to start eternal glowing is that a powdery you can if you want use a bit of blush are I'm going to use this color pop blush up this is called prenup and this is a satin blusher I'm going to use my duo fiber brush by Real Techniques and just just a little bit this gizmo cheese little bit of color a director's pick it up is this okay to finish the lips I'm going to use this color pop lippy stick this is in the color brick this is a matte color and then just for the sim and they're like to spread it around my finger just so it looks more natural and if you want I love lip glosses so I'm going to use this Charlotte Tilbury lip gloss in seduction just in the center and that is literally it for my makeup I don't think I was too much to it I don't think it was too hard I hope that you guys learn something from it I think it looks like natural this is as natural as I would go so this is just my take on natural ish makeup also if I was going back to school I would wear my hair like this I think it looks really good it I'm gonna put cake in my hair up and increase slow for my chunky if you haven't subscribe subscribe already like share favorite do it everyone comment just be nice so I'll see you guys in my next video love you
