take your phone Alicia hiding in your package until you get home hey guys it's like that so today I'm doing a Kalani inspiring tutorial and I saw this picture that just blew my mind and she looks amazing I'm just gonna show you this right here she looks amazing and I've been wanting to do this since last year and I'm finally getting around to it because I was always so scared because of this lip it is a dark blue super pretty color also I got a new ring light if you guys can't tell and I also got a backdrop and just let me know how you're liking all of this and I'm also going to be getting a new lens and everything is just going to be focused on me and everything's going to be blurred out in the back and just gonna look so so pretty and I don't know I'm just very excited about this as you guys can tell enough about my new setup I just wanted to show you guys how to do this makeup look and I know this isn't my usual look like I never wear jeans stuff I never put my hair up in a bun I never wear hoops and I don't usually have a nose ring but I just thought if I'm gonna be doing Kolani look I might as well try to look like her a little bit I hope you guys enjoy and let's get into the video first and I start off with a primer and I'm going to be using the Porefessional by benefit I'm just taking a dime size like this and I'm putting it on the places where I would usually be able to see lots of my pores and for my foundation I'm going to be taking the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless foundation this one is in the shade 120 classic ivory so if you guys have stick around before and seen my previous video so you guys would know that I love using the Beauty Blender but I decided hey it's scene I gotta expand my brush use so today I'm actually using a brush which is like surprising Wow but I'm just lightly dabbing my foundation all over my face and then on my forehead nose and sighs my face of course and especially on these blemishes and I'm just saying some on my neck too because my neck is always a different shade and then with the X's on my hand just going to be dabbing it on my brush it was really this pale this doesn't even match me okay this is seriously the lightest foundation I have and we're just gonna have to work with it I know it's not very even but it's gonna work so I'm just going to be dabbing my master conceal by Maybelline New York concealer on my under eyes and on all my problem areas blemishes runny nose and on my chin a little bit like a rubber mouth because I've been getting pimples around there and not to set all I'm going to be using my la girl pro powder for today's eyebrows I'm going to be using my eight cosmetics brow power Universal brow pencil but Kalani's eyebrows were a little bit darker and I feel like I can get away with darker brows today because I have my roots growing in so you can't it shouldn't really matter so first I'm to be taking the other side with the spoolie and just combing them out to prep them for the collar and now I'm going back in with my spoolie side and just fading out the front and just blending out the rest so not to clean up the brow so I'll be taking my billion dollar brows pencil and I'm going to be taking the highlighted shade and just line my rows and then to blend this out I'm going to be taking my two-in-one brow brush by billion dollar brows and I'm going to be taking this orange side here and then just going to be feathering it away okay so now moving on to the eyes I'm going to be using my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion first I'm going to be taking a fluffy brush like this and I'm going to be taking this palette that you can find on Amazon transition shade I'm going to be taking this light brown here and I'm just going to be making sure that my crease is nice and warmed up and I'm going to be taking this a little bit above the crease but also inside the crease so it's going to be kind of like a two-in-one I would say more of the product and then I would kind of like feather it onto the outside so I get a little bit more smoky and darker so it just looks like there's a lot more dimension into that and just so that I doesn't look too naked I'm going to be taking that same brown shade and I'm just going to be running it on my lower lash lines till the two colors I'm going to be using this palette is the two lightest shades here and I'm going to be using this one and this one is kind of like a peachy nude II type of eyelid so I'm going to be taking it on a eyes shadow brush and just basically packing it on to my eyelid and I'm just going to tone down the peach enos with this white shade here and it's not very pigmented so if you do have a white that's very primitive then just take one tap and that's it because we just want a slight type of film to cover the peach enos of the eye shadow and then we're going to go back in with the same fluffy brush and I'm just going to be taking the brown right next to the brown that we use in the beginning and this is more of like an ashy type of brown coat with the ashy shade I'm going to be taking it into my crease and making a little bit more definition just so it looks like we actually have a crease and then with the excess I'm going to be feathering it out onto the outside and just to even out the bottom color on the lower lash line I'm going to be taking that same ashy Brown and also running it on the lower lash line and after the brow bone I'm going to taking that same white that we used earlier just dipping it into my brush and doing some highlighting under the brow bone she also has a little bit of a highlight into her inner corner so I'm going to be taking that same white and just dabbing it into the inner corner so I just think that the highlighting on the brow bone and in the inner corner just made everything come together and it's much nicer also in the picture she had a simple line of eyeliner so I'm going to be using my the balm Schwing liquid liner and I think this is amazing because it dries matte and it's very easy to apply so basically this is just a straightforward line and she has kind like a look at the end but I'm really scared to try that because the flicks never turn out the same and now for falsies I'm going to be taking my red cherry number 82 - mascara I'm going to be using my it cosmetics hello lashes mascara this is amazing I use it in so many my make its tutorial sometimes blending my falsies and my real eyelashes together so first I'm going to bronze my face with a hula benefit bronzer so in the picture she was super super bronze stuff like here into her cheekbone area and also like here on her temples and in the picture she really didn't wear any blush so what I'm gonna be doing is while I'm bronzing my face I'm also going to be using this bronzer as my cheek color put a little fluffy brush I'm gonna be dipping it into my cool bronzer and just slimming out sides of my nose look at that nose contour oh my god so now I'm going to be doing a little bit of more contouring because what I was doing before was bronzing so I'm going to be taking this little brush here and I'm just going to be dipping it into this thank you this brush is really going to help me get a nice like clean very deepening type of contour so now my most favorite part I'm getting like chills just thinking about highlighting using the famous famous Becca champagne pop can we just take a moment to talk about that guys champagne pop so I'm going to be taking a small little brush like this dipping it into my beautiful Highland I'm going to be placing it right here this seriously changed the highlight game so now I'm going to be taking some on the tip of my nose of course you guys know I'm overdoing that then also I feel like she had a little bit of highlight on the very very points of her brow bone that that is highlight guys hold on gun season in Aspen what she was wearing this really beautiful blue lip color that really made me want to create this look I didn't have any blue lip liners so of course I'm going to be using a dark purple lip liner and I'm just going to be laying my lips with it and I'm filling in my lips with the Le girl matte flat velvet lipstick and this is in the shade Blue Valentine so now I'm going to be taking my la girl lip stick and just filling in the rest so that is all for this makeup look I love how it turned out like it is just so glowy so bronzy and then here you are with like this bold dark blue lip I've never done this before so I hope that you guys actually enjoy that I'm using a little bit more color and just kind of stepping out of my comfort zone but I forgot one thing she was actually wearing a nose ring so let's just let's just do it for the look in
