in there two dollars and they even know who I was they reached out to me and they thanked me for that video and a shout-out and then they told me that they wanted to build an affiliate program and they made me their first affiliate actually um because I was just so know what their products so I stand behind morphe I love their products they are Bob I don't think there's anyone out there that doesn't they do and gives you the quality they give you with the inexpensive price point like it's incredible honest to god and you see so many people raving about morphe not because anyone is getting paid you guys you see it because the products are good especially for the price if these products were hundreds of dollars I think it's a ripoff but these are so inexpensive and the quality is so not inexpensive like it's just good stuff honest to god and really the owners of this company are so amazing it's a company it's honestly a company that I want to give my money to the owners are a true rags to riches story they are a brother and sister who have come from nothing and made everything on their own they're so incredible and every youtuber or blogger who has had the opportunity to meet

it's a company that I want to work with it's company that I want to give my money to because they're just an amazing company so I expect to inform you on that you never know there's a lot of shady people out there there's more shady people in business and there are honest people so when I come across honest people I'm like I'm right or die for them and one of those brands they're honest good hard-working people okay so now that you got that backstory on more feet let's jump into the video I know I can talk very quickly so because of that I am going to put every brush I talked about I'm going to put the number down here on the screen so you guys can see it somewhere because I know if I'm like this is the he thought before or you're gonna get wait what did you guys so I'm gonna put everything on the screen I've been talking about it so that you can see with your own eyes the name of the brush so there's no confusion hopefully that will help say no I can talk very quickly in start to ramble so let's get started it is very hard to narrow down my favorites but I did it and I feel like right here these are like my substantial brushes and I'm like yes I use these all the time I love them I'm right or die I'm gonna bring any brushes into this collection I was kind of like I kind of like it these are all brushes I'm like I love them so that is where we're at right now if you get the opportunity to go to the actual morphe store in Burbank California do not turn opportunity down it is literally brush heaven they have probably a hundred and fifty different brushes and they're just lined up all over the walls it is so overwhelming but in the most beautiful wedding possible so the first brush I'm going to talk about is the foundation brush and this is one of my favorite foundation brushes ever and you guys know that because for about what four or five months this is the only foundation brush that I use and I force myself to use other ones now because it's just so repetitive but this is the m43 nine I'm gonna have to look at the numbers because I'm not going to I don't have these memorized um this is the m43 9 brush what makes this brush so amazing to me is the fact that I can use less product and get more coverage if that makes sense as opposed to using like a damp Beauty Blender this takes like half of your product this does not steal your product because of its short synthetic density it takes a little bit of foundation and it really spreads it out on the face so one like this which is the tarte kabuki brush this one steals a lot of product because it has longer bristles so what applies a more sheer coverage which is really nice and i love it but i do use more foundation when i'm using this brush and i use less foundation just like a little bit when i'm using this one and it spreads it further around the face and doesn't steal as much product that's why i love this so much and i just feel like it's the perfect size not too tiny or too fat and just me everything so even and beautiful this is one of my all-time favorites right here I want to talk about four different brushes from the Ely collection and as you can tell by the name elite it's a more high-end luxurious collection by morphe but still extremely reasonably priced they say their price point is much higher because these brushes are more elite and more like luxurious but still they're like a quarter of the price of a mac brush so they're still very wallet friendly on the first I'm going to talk about is just my this is my baby and this is the e4 right here that's the way the Ely collection goes at E 1 2 3 4 because elite so e 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so on this is the blush brush it's technically a contour brush I personally like contouring with angled brushes like this this is what I use for blush and what I love and appreciate so much about this is everyone always wants to make their blush brushes and a natural goat hair and I do not like applying blush with a natural goat hair I think that it can make it go on kind of patchy to go back and get so much blush because it doesn't apply it properly this is like the most perfect blush brush in the world like I wish I made it myself it's so good like I just feel like it was meant for me like it is all my dreams come true in a blush brush I never think I'm gonna use another blush brush again I have no desire to try one someone could tell me you have to try this blush brush it's the best in the world I did mmm sorry you tell nothing but lies this is the best next one we have here is the e 34 and as you can see this one is just like a nice basic brush it's nice and round it's pretty short but it's not too short so it's not too dense what I like to use this for is blending out my bronzer I will show you the brushes that I initially fie bronzer with you can totally apply bronzer with this just right on the face perfect but I do things just a little bit different way in my routine and this is the blush brush that I will use once things are put on the face and maybe it's looking a little choppy maybe just a little unblended I will go over everything with this brush and just kind of blend everything out it's a really great just face blending brush if you need to blend out your contour your blush whatever it may be it's just one of those perfect sized round dome shape synthetic brushes that just blends everything out nice and smooth now we have the ìiî and this one is kind of a fat guy press out like this it gets nice and chubby but if you go like this it gets a little bit more thin and it goes up to this taper which I love and this is what I use where is my powder wait where's my powder seriously this one I use with the Laura Mercier translucent powder I use this to set my whole face is just nice and smooth and it applies powder very lightweight because we have this tapered miss right here you have bristles that are all different lengths and that will make things be applied very surely as opposed to a brush like this little pack things on it's all about the brush lengths that really like determine how your powder will be applied so that's why I use this brush for a nice loose powder because it will apply it really smoothly and softly and won't make it like patch up and then when you take flash photography all of a sudden you've got like white spots on your face this keeps everything nice and smooth so just great all over the face powder brush this bad boy oh my gosh I love is brush so much this one is actually a new one that I just grabbed from like my pile of like new brushes I actually have three of these though because I love this so much I'll tell you why this is the e one actually my face this is that you wanted as you can see it's really fat and it's really dense like it's really really chubby I'm gonna teddy - it feels very heavy weight and luxurious um believe it or not my favorite thing to use this brush for is actually applying tanner to my body um if you've seen my tanning routine I will leave it down below for you guys know has at the end of this video but I will um you see that like I edition I initially start off with this and I use this brush now I use this one actually the past three times I've applied tanner my body I've use this on my entire body and I haven't used a mint I literally just use this because it's so big in fat and it gets the job done so quick and so smooth because it's synthetic the honest-to-god this is my favorite way to apply some mascara now the other way that I will use this is if I do my foundation and I haven't tan in a while my foundation is too dark and I have like a line right here I will take some Ron's err on this brush and I will supply some of it and kind of bring it down to another thing I use this for so basically I use this as a body brush but if you are a powder girl if you like powder foundation and you want a full coverage this would be your go-to right here if you want sheer coverage I would do this if you want a full coverage this right here will get the job done an applier powder-like done so now for contour brush it I have to contour slash bronzer we're going to go through both of them and this one is the m5 two three oh my god I love those lines Oh much it is the most amazing contour brush I think I use it on camera for the first time maybe maybe I'm telling lies I'm not really quite sure so don't quote me on that I love this this is my go-to contour brush now because it's not too skinny um the NARS eita brush I'm not comparing anything but the NARS II to brush you guys know I've been ride or die for this for several years and I still absolutely love it but the one thing that I've heard other people complain about is that once they put the line on their face kind of difficult to blend that line out and I get it you have to really like be kind of careful with the way you apply it and you do that that this brush you don't have to worry about that because of the density again it's tapered we have shorter bristles down here and then it goes up to longer bristles that makes it so that when you put this on it doesn't create this harsh lines you can't blend out it makes it really easy to blend out your contour and it's not like a drag queen contour where it's like extremely cut off it makes it nice and soft in a more natural like can K contour I can't believe I this reference Kim K next one is basically a bigger fatter daddy version of this one like they pretty much have the same shape almost but this one is just like King Kong and this one 20 so this is the five to seven brush I love this for bronzing I would not consider this a contour brush though but it's an amazing bronzing brush I love it it gets on so quick and so beautifully I have been loving the where where am I I'm Norris here we go I have been loving it this luminous bronze light um bronzer from hourglass recently and I use this brush to apply I just go in like this tap it off and I just apply it all over the face like that I love it it just makes it so smooth because like I said I love applying bronzer with natural hairs for some reason blush and other areas of face I like a synthetic brush but bronzer I really really like the more natural hairs to apply it because it just makes it so natural looking and so smooth and bronze are something that I do not want to apply too generously otherwise it can go real quick and that's what the go hair will prevent it'll apply less products and make it less more smooth and more blendable so that's why I love this brush ok this brush I cannot live without I will make a bronzer slash contour blush highlight baking video I see the request to that so I will do that soon I'm just trying to get through like all the holiday videos but this brush you'll see me use it in that video this is the end four five nine brush you see me use this whenever I bake in my videos and I just like go like this you can see this powder on it right now and I stamp out the area that I really want to chisel that's what I love for this so much I've never actually used this for contour you can see off my Laura Mercier powder in there but I've never actually just a contour because it's too harsh I would not like the way this contours I can just tell but it is like perfection for carving out your contour so if you're sloppy is good to go yesterday my friend mica was here and her bronzer was kind of all over the place at the end of the day and not looking sharp not looking clean so I literally just grabbed this brush it went boo boo boo boo Boop and then just wiped it off and it looked nice and tight and clean again that's what I love about this brush such a great method and it's such a great brush to do that method with you guys see me use this brush in every video oh my goodness gracious this is the for 3/8 and I use this one to set my under eye area no matter what I'm setting it with no matter what powder this is the brush I use and I also use it to clean up down here any of the powder that I'm applying until I set the chin area I use set a forehead with highlight like whatever I am doing is like a lighter powder this is what I use to do that it's a great brush it applies things nice and gently again because you have the tapered area the shorter brushes that go to the longer ones and it's just such a great brush Sigma has one that's like the exact same pretty much right here this is their like gold collection it's like the exact same brush but the morphe ones just cheaper ah this is my baby this is the Evan 501 brush that's the only brush that I actually have to look in the numbers I just know I've talked to my head um this is the brush that I use for highlighting it's not technically a highlight brush I don't remember what they technically marketed as but soon as I got it I was this is perfection for highlighting and it's what I have used ever since I use a lot of other brushes for highlight and like I test them out like if people send me a brush in the mail or send me things to try on my first year I tried I'm like this is just it I always go and end up grabbing this one and applying my highlight with this brush because I just feel like it applies it nice and gentle gentle nice and gently and smooth and I just get the outcome that I desire I don't get too much and I go don't get too little so the m500 one my favorite highlight brush I get asked this all the time this is it right here buy more feet now we're going to move on to rushes and the first one I want to talk about is actually the first brush that I would go in with when doing any I look like the one I did today this is what I use or smokey eye this is the first brush that I'll recommend going in with and this is the morphe and obviously you buy morphe Jaqueline get it together this is the m4 for one rush so you would take up your lightest transition shade and then just go ahead and apply it right here in that transition area and if you're wondering what the transition area is it's the space between your eyelid and your brow bone right there you would put a really light color and that's going to be the transition to when you're doing any I look that's going to kind of fade out the transition from like heavy eye to nothing so that's the brush that I would use for that area is a natural hair so it applies it really nice and soft and smooth it doesn't like put on like a dense amount because you don't want that when you're working high up in this area this brush was created for this high up area and keeping it nice and smooth so I'm four for one this one is a ride-or-die can't live without this brush this is my absolute favorite I rush all-time and this is the M 4-3-3 brush I talk about this in a favorites video a few months back I have a couple of these because I just I'm constantly using this brush for everything this is the most like multi functional brush that I own because you can pack stuff on all of the live with this you can blend it out you can go hide in the low and go under the eye you can do anything with this so the M 4-3-3 has is my favorite eye shadow brush by morphe but what I use this one for typically and as you see in all my tutorials I use this brush every single time is packing on a color and the outer crease because of the shape again you have shorter bristles out here and then barely longer ones in the center ever so slightly so it's not too intense but it just makes it so that applies it so smoothly and it's so easy to blend out it's just such a good brush it's such a freakin good brush and then if you don't have products on it yes I'm using my leggings no judgement if you get the product off of your brush it makes a great brush to also apply up higher and the transition area as well it's just shorter and a little bit more denser than the original one that I talked about so you can see the difference sorry we're out of focus you can see the difference right there this one would supply a little less product and this one applies a little more which is why I initially like to go in with this one the m4 for one and then go in with the m4 3 3 next we have the e 22 this is a part of the elite collection since it has the e in front of it and is synthetic this one is really different and I love that about it so this one goes up to a nice taper as you can see very short bristles on the side to get longer and longer longer to a nice pointed taper which is great for when you're doing something right in this crease so if you want to add depth and you want to keep it low and you want to make sure that it doesn't go up too high into that transition area one like this might not be your best friend if you're working in that area and you want to keep it precise because it is so fluffy which is what I love about it because it blends everything out so nicely but this one on the other hand it doesn't blend it out as much but it keeps it nice and low and tight so now I have four smaller brushes more like precision brushes which I absolutely cannot live without precision brushes I feel like are something that can be really overlooked in the brush community but for me personally they're just as important as the blending brushes to get nice and precise on an eye look and the first one is the M 3 2 1 I love this for packing on it dark colors so sometimes like if you want to get something really nice and tight like low in this area the outer corner sometimes when you're using brushes like this they're a little too big and you feel like you can't get it right you can't get it like as dark as you want it to be because they're they're big and they're more for like the crease area this brush that's where this comes in and is the star of the show it picks up so much products and gets it so tight and dense on that eye and makes it so dark it's so amazing and because of the fact that it is synthetic and it's not a natural hair it puts so much product on your actual lid and makes it nice and dark which I actually love this brush for that this is not a pencil brush though don't get it confused it's nice and rounded but I would not use this really for blending out the lower lash line unless you have no products on this and you already put products on there and you're just blending it out with this being completely bare then you could use it but I really wouldn't use this as a pencil brush don't use it more for packing on hoping that make sense but speaking of pencil brushes this is the e 18 and this is a great pencil brush you guys have seen use this many times you guys see me use all these many times let's get real this one is really really nice for blending things out it is a little bit of a longer pencil brush so when you're packing like the color on the brush what I do is I make sure not to let let my brush go side to side otherwise you're going to get all the products on the side when using a pencil brush just make sure you go do poop like that to get the products on just up and down and maybe a little swirl and then tap off the excess you don't want to go like this otherwise if you get on the side and now it's going to be sloppy so when you're blending out your lower lash line just boop-boop into the product and then go in and begin just to blend using just the tip of it and that's how you'll get that really nice smooth smoked out lash line and for smoking out that lash line this is the most important brush I physically could not do my makeup without this brush I use it every day and this is the m43 to and it's just a flat definer brush it's completely and totally flat as you can see on the top nice and tight this is the brush that I go in with my blacks my dark brown my dark purples whatever it may be and get nice and tight what is on my face and get nice and tight on that lower lash line to make it get right in there and then I will go in and blend it out with a pencil brush such as this one right here this one is also amazing for like smoking out your top liner you guys have seen me do that a million times or if you're doing a more neutral natural look you can take that the dark brown this brush and just use that strictly for your eyeliner and put it right on your lash line you can also put this underneath of your lashes right here kind of darken up the lash area and kind of tight line these little definer brushes are just so amazing and I just love them so much I can't do my makeup without definer brushes and this one believe it or not is my favorite definer brush I think of all time um this is the e36 again it's from their elite collection it's the last brush so I have to talk about and when I start using this I was like how have I ever gone through my life without this little brush right here this is what I use to highlight my inner corner and it is so perfect once you have a brush like this to highlight the inner corner of your eyes you're just like what am I ever supposed to use ever again like this is the inner corner Queen right here it's just so perfect to get in there and highlight and not make it too messy because with an inner corner highlight if you're using Frost like I do like Mac nylon eyeshadow if you get that down here too far like in this area now it looks like you have bags and if you get it too close to the nose and now it's too much you want that inner corner highlight to be nice and precise and that's what I love about this brush so much so that's it you guys gonna get power to that video like I really hope that you guys enjoy this these are my all-time absolute favorite morphe brush loveable absolute very morphe brushes um at the moment I of course have other ones right here that I really enjoy as well but these are like my ride-or-die homeys for life so if you guys need a June updated one down the road you know like
