hey guys it's Amanda I'm you Samuel make a by Samuel on Instagram so he did this whole glam look on me and it looks amazing so he's gonna show you how you can do this so we're putting on moisturizer and this moisturizer is by benefit and we're just gonna apply it with a brush all over her face wait for it to soak in yes how long does it take um I usually wait like 10 20 seconds I'll soak in real quick since I use a lot of powders I like to use a lot of moisturizer cuz at the end it ends up looking like skin and not like so much makes sense when I try to use powders underneath my eyes and like wherever I highlight yeah it's like really dry yeah so the foundation we're gonna be using is by Makeup Forever HD in 1:20 and I chose a color that's a little less lighter because I kind of want to give her a little tan and then later we're gonna blend it in with a Beauty Blender so Amanda actually has really great skin tan Hey has that anybody else for you to set I think in the first video that I've done like this oh also I mean I'm like done fun videos in the video okay so it's like yeah I'm gonna start blending blending is key so now we're just gonna close you a screw brush a little foundation your eyelids so how long does it take you to edit a video it depends on what kind of video if it's like one where I'm just sitting down talking that's it's like 30 minutes oh wow but if it's something like this will probably take a while yeah so the concealer I'm going to be using is by Dior and this is the Dior nude concealer and we're gonna start highlighting her face let's make sure you apply it really good and then a little on her lip on her chin Amanda honestly doesn't need this much makeup but this is glam so a while and then we're gonna go with our Beauty Blender and just blend now I like my Beauty Blender to be damn it helps with the blending to use your Beauty Blender wet or dry yeah I mean I use it wet when I'm blending but then I also use it dry for like powder and see I like it when it's wet for powder under the eyes yeah so just make sure you really blend everything I usually cream contour but on Amanda we're going to use a powder contour what's the difference with the effective well powder is going to give you more of a softer look versus cream that's going to give you more of a really contoured look so the powder I'm gonna be using is Laura Mercier and I'm just gonna set the under-eye area this is going to prevent it from creasing and also it's gonna act as a shield for when we do your eye shadow so I'm gonna take some of that powder and I'm just gonna lightly set it under her eyes we're just gonna softly blend it down what's your favorite sushi place no boom I love Nobu so now I'm gonna start studying her face and for that I'm gonna be using Laura Mercier translucent powder and then I powder I'm gonna get a little spun sugar this circle right and we're just gonna set under her cheekbone and what this is going to do it's going to help when we contour it's going to give her more of a defined cheek row I don't know lip highlight and then the rest of the face I'm going to set it with laura mercier so I'm going to take a studio
