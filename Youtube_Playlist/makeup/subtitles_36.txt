hey guys and welcome back to my channel so today what we're gonna be doing as a makeup tutorial yeah eyes notice the lighting is a little bit different my ring light finally came in and I gotta say I'm loving it I don't know how I've been doing YouTube and beauty stuff for as long as I have without one are a little bit privacy but like I'm upset you guys can already tell the quality of this video is so much better I'm just really excited for today's makeup tutorial I decided to use the morphe 35o palette it came back in stock two weeks ago I thought that people would start getting their palettes in so why not film a tutorial using one so maybe you guys can come up with some looks or if you don't have the 3500 or so many brands that sell single shadows like this and also morphe also sells these in single shadows I'm pretty sure so this is what the palette looks like as you guys see it's like literally my heaven warm tones I mean some cool talents but mostly warm tones and it's gorgeous you guys did not get your hands on it I don't know if it's still in stock if it is I will link it in my description bar down below that's all that I have to say I love you guys and if you guys want to see how to achieve this makeup look and then just keep watching do you guys thought this video was gonna be a little bit different but it's not we're gonna be taking Peach Smoothie from makeup geek and we're gonna be using a 224 from Mac and we're just gonna be using this as our transition shade like I said before it doesn't matter what palette I'm using what shadows I'm using this shadow is always going to be in my crease as a transition color it's just closest to my skin tone I love warm colors even if I'm doing a cool toned look I will always go in with this first starting with a transition shade makes it super easy to blend out shadows later on especially if you're doing dark colors even if you're doing light colors you want like that seamless blend so always transition colors alright so now we're taking the morphe brushes 35o palette and I'm taking this cranberry warm shade and we're gonna be using a Mac 217 and applying this first in our outer corner and then we're gonna be bringing that all the way through so I'm building up the pigmentation of this I love morphe brushes shadows I think that they're a great quality for the price that they're at they're like two dollars a single shadow I think it was 20 something for this whole entire pallet there's like five rows of multiple colors and I'm obsessed with this so now we're just taking this warm shade it kind of looks like Peach Smoothie and we're just gonna blend out the edges of this orange shade because it was getting a little too like harsh for me so I just wanted to blend that out to make sure that it's like a nice gradient from dark to light so this is really similar to Peach Smoothie except I think it's a little bit darker than that and like I have a thing about this palette guys it is so good I don't think that they're as good as makeupgeek but they're good for two dollars and now we're taking this same shade but it's a little bit darker so the first shade we used is really similar to this one except this one is darker and I'm taking out a pencil brush and just deepening up the crease I really really really want some depth in this outer corner since we're gonna have a really highlighted inner corner I want there to be that luck light in the inner corner to darken the outer corner super contrast I just love the way that that looks and I like myself a really defined crease I don't think I've ever done a look that doesn't have a defining to crease I mean to be totally honest with you guys and now we're just taking a little bit more of that transition shade and we're blending out the warm shades so I'm just kind of going in and blending as we go and now we're taking Americano from makeup geek I know I had to use some makeup geek shades there wasn't a really dark color that I liked that was warm in this palette cuz I want to keep this a pretty warm look and I'm taking the same pencil brush and then focusing this just on that outer corner for some more depth you're gonna have to layer colors that's how you're gonna get some depth in your eyes lighter and darker um the more colors you use the more depth you're going to see and now we're just taking this 217 with nothing on it and we're gonna be blending out the edges I really go back and forth so many times to blend and now we're taking that inner corner color which reminds me so much of in the spotlight from makeup geek so this is a great dupe for that if you guys didn't want to spend $6 on that or $9 however much that is this palette has that shade in and I'm pretty sure morphe sells all of these shades singly I'm not 100% sure but you guys can definitely check but I'm pretty sure they do and now we're just taking the 217 and blending where the inner corner shadow meets the outer corner because it really does leave us such a stark line and I don't like that at all so now we're gonna be taking their real mascara and just applying some mascara before lashes like I said before you have to apply mascara before or you're gonna cut down the life of your lashes and then we're gonna be applying some duo lash glue on the lashes you guys know best lash glue smells like fish all right so I didn't apply my lashes on camera again whoops sorry guys and now we're gonna be taking my two favorite primers makeup forever step1 equalizer and smoothing and I use this one first to fill in my pores I don't you guys just want to keep me matte cuz it doesn't so I use it just to fill in my pores and smooth out my skin and then I take that Becca ever matte primer which keeps me so mad and I'll just apply that in my t-zone area and it really absorbs my oil and now we're taking the Sephora infusion foundation and the number 20 and I'm just taking my finger and dotting it all over my skin first like I said before I feel like this is the best way to apply foundation so you're not ending with so much on your skin and you're not gonna be packing it into your brush and your wasting product so now I'm just adding all over my face and starting to blend it in with a sigma f80 flat top kabuki I want you guys to watch how this just makes my skin look so airbrush this is my favorite brush I don't know if you guys own it it's literally on everyone's like list of favorites every youtuber I swear to god has always mentioned this brush but I mean look at what it's doing to my skin obviously it's so worth it so I just kind of like swirl my brush in circular motions and buff this into my skin because I wanted to mesh with it I want my skin to start absorbing the product and I want it to just look like a second layer of skin I don't want it to look like there's like this whole layer of product and it feels like a mask and looks like a mask you guys don't want that either because that just looks too obvious that you're wearing foundation and this one isn't that heavy coverage I mean this isn't definitely a solid medium but as you guys see that little pimple on my forehead it still shows through so it doesn't it just kind of takes away the redness and I like that I don't want like a full caked face that's just not what I prefer I mean if you guys do that is perfectly okay so now we're taking the bare skin bare minerals concealer uh and this is my favorite part of any makeup look concealing my undereyes because as you see you go from hot or not too hot I do I love concealing my under eyes I just feel like it makes the look I love highlighting I like the contrast between the contouring and the highlighting oh I'll always contour and highlight so now we're just gonna take a clean Beauty Blender which I haven't cleaned my nan ages but this is freshly clean thank God and we're just gonna be blending it and lightly the lightest amount of pressure you don't need to beat your face with the Beauty Blender I mean you can if you want I have many times but light pressure will blend it in just fine so as you guys see it just covers all of that darkness and it cancels out it all without having to like cancel it out first so now we're just blending all the rest of the highlight in you want to make sure your highlight is even everywhere or it's just gonna look kind of stark white under your eyes now we're just gonna set it with me balloons translucent powder which is my favorite guys yeah and it doesn't leave that stark white so it's got like a little tint to it it's not like a white powder which I love because when you take flash photography which I noticed this weekend it does not give you that foundation flash back your skin looks like it does in person which I love because I've tried many translucent powders that when you take flash photography I literally look like Casper the Friendly Ghost and I'm not even kidding like white so I'm glad this one doesn't do it and now I have to set the rest of my face if I don't set my foundation it literally will peel off like a mask and now we're going to be taking the UH Nastasia contour kit and the shades fawn and Java and mixing them together on the brush and contouring my face so I'm contouring and bronzing kind of at the same time I'm using the fawn shade as the contour the more cool tone and then I'm using Java is that warm shade kind of bronze up I feel like it's so easy to kind of just do it in one step instead of contouring and then bronzing I think that this just does it really nicely it's not too orange and it's not too cool it's just a nice mixture on my cheeks and it warms me up and I don't look one dimensional anymore and now we're gonna contour my forehead just keep going over that pimple I mean make it more obvious and you guys know I love contouring my forehead I say it in literally every video because bitch needs that and then my other favorite part I love cutting my contour so I'm just taking the translucent powder and I'm making a sharp line if you guys want to see a full highlight contour baking routine let me know in the comments down below and I can definitely film one of those for you I just love cutting my contour and baking underneath I think it just makes everything look so clean and so precise and it's my favorite so now we're taking six Sigma's blush in heavenly and this is just a warm blush I don't even mean to make this a full warm tutorial but I just love a subtle blush and this one is probably one of my favorite and now we're gonna be taking a champagne pop by Jacqueline Hill and Becca cosmetics I have not used this in so long and it's my absolute favorite highlight do you guys see how it just gives you that subtle glow but I mean you can take it top notch which you guys will see that I do but I like that it's subtle and it just makes you look like you're glowing from within and not like you just have like glitter all over your cheeks which I can't stand I feel like I like it to be like just a glow from within like you're just beaming and now we're gonna be wiping away that translucent powder after we let it set and then I'm just gonna be blending that in because I hate having a harsh line I feel like it's so unflattering so make sure to blend and now we're gonna be taking Sigma e21 brush and we're just using the same shades that we used in the top portion of our eye in completing the eye by blending out the bottom I feel like if you do this it really completes it and it really makes the eye look just come together so we're just taking all the shades in this pencil brush to blend everything out as you guys see compared to the other eye it just doesn't look complete so make sure to always apply something if anything on your lower lash line and just taking this big fluffy brush and a little bit of that shade from the morphe 35o and blending it out and guys sorry for all these crazy faces they make but we all make these makeup faces sometimes when I'm watching my tutorials I'm like oh my god like am I the only one who makes these faces and I'm like no there's no way so now we're gonna be applying some mascara on the lower lash line and this is the voluminous carbon black from L'Oreal you guys know I've been I raved about this in my favorites video it's just beautiful do you see what it does for my lower lashes it just makes them thick and fluffy and not like long and spidery which I don't have time for long in spite of her lashes I think that's super unflattering so we're just taking this and going from the root and wiggling out to extend my lashes and now we're taking this liquid lipstick from Kat Von D in bow-and-arrow and it's really similar to Lime Crime cashmere but I mean we all know Lime Crime so I mean I'm not gonna bring anything up but I will not be purchasing from them so this is the closest shade I have found it's really similar to sepia also but i swatched these two next to each other and sepia is a lot darker so this one is more of like a brownish gray and sepia is more of like a grey grey so I think this is something you can wear every day it does not look crazy on the lips I think it's more of like a pinky nude with I mean like a brownie nude then anything and I really loved how this looked with this entire look it just pulled it all together it was something neutral on the lips which was definitely needed so that is all that I have for this video guys I hope you guys enjoyed I love you guys and don't forget to subscribe
