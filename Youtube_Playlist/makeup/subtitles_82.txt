hey guys and welcome back to my channel today's makeup tutorial is going to be on how to achieve this soft full neutral makeup look to get started I'm gonna be applying my matte natural radiance primer all over my skin before we apply foundation this will just hydrate my face and also just prep it so my foundation goes on smoothly and then I'm taking my ax1 invisi wear foundation and just applying it all over my skin and just kind of dotting it everywhere and then I'm going to be blending that into my complexion with the Real Techniques sculpting brush and I'm just kind of going in circular motions and Cyborg motions just to kind of buff this into the skin and I want to kind of get the most even layer as possible because we are going to be applying concealer so we don't really need to apply a second layer of this so one layer will be just fine and just making sure that the whole of my face is covered because this is a darker color than my face because it matches my neck so just make sure that it's all blended in I have gone ahead and filled in my brows off-camera if you do want to see how I do fill in my brows I will pop a link in the description box for you so you can see how I do it next I'm just going to be taking my soft ochre Paint Pot and just applying this all over my eyelids to make sure that the eyeshadow I apply sticks and appears more vibrant then I'm taking the Too Faced chocolate bar palette and I'm gonna be starting off with this peachy brown shade and I'm going to use this as my first transition color I'm going to be taking this on a big fluffy blending brush and I'm just going to go side to side and make sure this is really well blended into the crease as always because this is my first transition shade you want to make sure this blends in really well to the rest of your eye that way all the other colors you apply will just blend it really really seamlessly so just blend it as much as you can then taking this milk chocolate shade I'm going to be applying this into the crease also I want to very seamlessly create a smokey effect I want it to be very soft so graduating into a darker color slowly that's the best way to create that effect so I'm just going to be applying this into the outer V increase area and then going back into that previous brush to make sure that it's really well blended into each other that way again there's no harsh lines and that smokiness is going to look really really effortless and just really well blended then I'm taking this warm brown shade and I'm going to be applying this into the outer corner also this will just prepare it for the darkest Brown we're going to apply and it just makes that dark brown blend a lot easier and it just gives that really nice airbrushed effect which is what we're going for with this look so just blend that as well as you can also and then we're going to go into the dark fudge color that's just right here and we're going to be applying that into the outer corner with a separate brush we want to keep this color as close to the crease as possible we're gonna take out too far because we are going to blend it out a little looks really seamless as you can see I'm just kind of going back and forth between brushes then I'm just taking a q-tip and just cleaning up the sides this will just make everything look a ton neater next I'm just going to be taking this cool brown shade and I'm just going to be applying it onto the center of my lid this will just kind of create that really nice shimmery effect I'm just taking this really nice peachy light shimmery shade and I'm just going to be applying that on the inner part that Brown we just applied will make it transition a lot nicer and it'll just make it look like it's just blending into the rest of the eye next I'm just going to apply some lashes these are the Vegas nail Iowa grand glamour lashes I absolutely love these these are so gorgeous and you just don't need to do anything and it just transforms the look into such a glamorous look so I'm just applying them with some tweezers and just making sure they're really well stuck on because I'm not applying any eyeliner you want to make sure they're stuck as close to the lash line as possible then I'm just taking some mascara and applying them to my natural lashes that way they blend into the false ones a lot better and you can't tell where your natural lashes start or finish next I'm going to start on my concealer I'm applying my Maybelline age rewind concealer underneath my eyes and I'm kind of taking in an upwards motion to give myself that really nice lifted effect I'm also applying some of this on my forehead down the bridge of my nose and also on my chin as always this will just highlight these areas and really bring them forward and this will just kind of stroke to your face really really well and to blend it into the rest of my complexion I'm going to be using it the Real Techniques sculpting brush again this is the same brush I used to apply my foundation and it just blends everything so flawlessly then I'm going in with my Sigma 3d HD precision brush you guys know I love this brush just to get into all the little areas that a larger brush cannot reach is the perfect shape my base always looks so flawless when I use this because it just gets into all those little areas then I'm going to be setting my under eyes with the soap &amp; Glory instant retouch powder and I'm taking it on a sigma f-35 brush and I'm just making sure to set all the areas where I applied my concealer that way it won't budge and it also will prevent shine also and then I'm just taking a larger brush and just applying it on the rest of the areas also just to make sure that everything is nice and set next taking a large shader brush I'm going to take some of that warm brown color onto the bottom lash line this is just going to create a really nice balanced effect from the top and the bottom lash line and to make it look a little bit smoky er I'm going to take that darkest Brown we applied and I'm going to apply that as close to the lash line as possible so as you can see I'm just kind of pressing it against the lash line and this will just kind of create a really subtle smoky effect without it being too much and then I'm taking this champagne color and I'm going to apply this on my inner corner as the highlight before that inner area and this will just make the eyes look so much brighter and it will just kind of finish off the look as well next I'm playing some nude eyeliner into the waterline this will again just make the eyes look larger more brighter and it just kind of makes it look a little bit softer then applying black if you were to apply a black it would look a lot heavier so this will just kind of give it that softer effect and then I'm just applying some mascara to my bottom lashes to balance the top and the bottom and that way the whole eye look is complete and then we are ready to move on to the bronzer to Brunn's my skin I'm gonna be using this shade from the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit in lights and I'm just going to use this on that big zueva brush I always love to use I simply love this brush and I'm just going to be bronzing all of my face because I just kind of feel like this look is quite neutral and I just want to make my face look nice and warm and because I'm gonna be applying blusher I like to wear bronzer and blush together because I just feel like it looks better on my complexion so I'm just kind of bronzing the perimeter of my face and then I'm gonna be going in with the form color from that contour kit also and I'm going to slightly contour the cheeks also and this will just kind of give my face a little bit more shape without it looking too harsh I love using this phone shade on the nose as well because it's cool and after contour but it is warm enough to look normal at the same time without looking too gray I'm just using a small blending brush to just go around the corners of my nose to make it look slimmer and then I'm taking this blusher from the balm and just applying it onto my cheeks you guys know I rarely wear blusher but I wanted to apply some because this is a full look and then I'm taking my Becca opal highlighter and just using this on the tops of my cheekbones to give us that glow I didn't want to apply too much of this and this just kind of gives us that champagne glow without being too gold or summer so you can still look glowing but you're not going to look as golden so also applying some of that on the tip of my nose and then I'm going to be moving on to my lips and firstly starting off with stone lip liner from Mac I'm just going to be running this along the outside of my lip bone and I'm just going to be using this to cool down the lips before I apply the next shade and then going to be applying a Rimmel lip liner I'm not actually sure the shade of this liner but as always everything will be down in the description box I just wanted to combine the two colors to create a really nice deep mode I didn't have a lipliner that would sort of match it so I just kind of created my own I love customizing lip liners I feel like you can create such a nice touch with that I don't even know how to explain this color but it's basically like a brownie pink mauve color this is one nine nine five from gerard cosmetics and i'm just going to be applying this all over the top just to warm it up a little bit i feel like this limp is perfect for the autumn but i did want it to be a little bit more matte so i did set my lips with some translucent powder this is the same pad i used to set my under eyes so guys this is the finished look I hope you guys enjoyed my first full
