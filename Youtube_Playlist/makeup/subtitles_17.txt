your skin such a dewy finish if you have dry skin you will love the stuff if you have more of a oily skin you're not going to like it because it gives really good you look very shiny the buffing brush because you have to buffing into your skin and you cannot use this with a Beauty Blender I learned the hard way because there's little beads inside of it that color match your skin tone and if you use a big burner then it won't break why mate why am i smiling I don't know I'm just so happy so happy but yeah you gotta use a buffing brush for this and just buff into your skin I love this stuff it just makes my skin look so healthy and it's very very light coverage next I'm going to be going in with my mac pro long concealer and NC 42 and just applying this in the dark areas of my face like under my eyes and around the corners of my milk next I'm going to be using this useless brush that I thought would work well but it didn't so I kind of just threw that aside and use my Beauty Blender to just blend it all in this is a new camera by the way I'm just still trying to figure out how it works but yeah next I'm going to be taking the Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer it's my favorite and it's in rich bronze it's just so beautiful and it gives your skin the glow that you've always wanted it's just perfect I love the stuff I just came back from Colorado and we went to a target there and they had it so I picked up a few I love it I love it so much and I just I love looking bronze so I kind of just drag that down my neck and just warm up my cheeks I love this stuff so much did I say I love this stuff I love the stuff next I'm going to be using the tray under the bronzer and I'm just going to be blending out my concealer before I set it because it started to crease I'm just going to be going in with banana powder very lightly and just pushing it under my eyes to prevent creasing I'm not really baking at this point I'm just kind of setting my makeup next I'm going to be going in with corduroy and wedge eyeshadow by Mac and I'm going to be contouring my nose now this is the fave my favorite part of of putting on my makeup again I don't wear all this makeup every single day but it's

know what I mean next I'm going to be mixing Blount and Peach twists and just warming up my cheeks as well and my go-to blush is a more of a corner I don't know my go-to blush is a more of a coral colored bronzy colored blush that's what I love wearing so I love to warm up my cheeks with that and I'm now I'm just applying a highlighter it's just a regular eyeshadow from Mac I think it's in all that glitters next I'm going to be applying my voluminous mascara and I love this mascara so much but to be honest it's I think it's causing my lashes to fall out and that's not so good so I need to stop using it but I love it what how did that even happen I love it so much so I need to find a really good mascara so if you guys know a really good drugstore mascara list that down below now I'm

glue with some liquid liner and I'm just applying a very thin layer very very thin layer just to cover the glue of the lashes and to make it look more natural like I'm not weighing this out or anything like that just very lightly putting this on the lash line of my lash line and then dragging that in the corner of my eye yeah you know what time it is it's stripped downtown it's not it's not
