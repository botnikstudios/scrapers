for long today I'm gonna be showing you some new products that I have been using and I'm just really excited about um that have been helping with my makeup application I've been noticing that like my past foundation routine ish has been good like my makeup looks good but for me from like in person I can just see through my makeup I just wasn't liking that you can see my pores you could see you know some of my scarring so I kind of had to like rego I had to go out again and find something that works for me so I have a couple products I'll be showing you guys in this video that have helped me so much with just covering my acne scars my acne just helping my pores look more minimize and Lotso like you know right in your face and just some other products I haven't really worked for me and I just like the way my makeup looks now does it still clean fresh nice so yeah it would help you guys out in that little area there plus I found some products that are good for like combination skin or oily skin so I kind of wanna give this video for you guys too as well um and yeah so my birthday is tomorrow well today is June on June 11th one thing today is January 11th my birthday is tomorrow I'm gonna be going to prices right hopefully I actually get called a vertical don't forget to subscribe to my channel and don't forget to give this video a like and I will see you guys right now we're gonna get to this tutorial like right over here like just yeah okay so to start off with my bare mineral skin longevity sir I'm going to take two pumps of that and just put it all over my face and this is supposed to enhance skin longevity and just give you some moisture this is my favorite right now the Becca poreless matte foundation or not foundation excuse me primer when I tell you it just sucks up all the oil in your face it is so amazing I just I'm so glad that I got a chance to use this then I'm going to be going in with the Mac strobe cream just to give those high points of my face a little bit more of enhancement you know just to give it a little more glow I'm going to go in with my Tarte foundation and I'm gonna use my L'Oreal true match foundation and mix those two together to give me that flawless finish but going back to the Becca poreless matte found on my foundation but the met Rebecca excuse me primer it is so good I it I just have to tell you guys get a sample of it Sephora try it out I'm telling you if you have combination skin like me or oily skin like me it just modifies skin so well and I really really suggest you use it it minimizes pores and yeah it's probably the best primers I've used and I don't even use primer like I don't like primer like that but it has to be one of the best ones I've tried if you've watched my other tutorials you know that these two concealers are my favorite the Maybelline age rewind dark circle eraser and the la girl pro conceal in the color yellow mixed together I love just the way that it covers up my dark circles and highlights my face and I'm just going to take my Beauty Blender and blend out the fine lines and things like that so my good friend ELISA Ashley put me on to the 3d face creator from Ruby kisses and I got this from my local Beauty Supply but I was using the cover FX highlight and contour kit and I have to say that this is just as good as that one as well I love the consistency of it it's very creamy and blendable and I like the color as well so it's almost like kind of the same color that I was using in the cover FX highlight contour kit so if you guys haven't tried this yet I suggest you do it's a great great contour for your face I'm just going to blend out those edges and then move on to setting my highlight with my shiny powder and Lauria Mercier mixed together I like to mix these two together because I like the yellow undertone of the shiny powder and I like the way the Laura Mercier sets the makeup it just she's just so great so moving on to my eye makeup I've been doing this I look a lot lately I'm using the pure minerals blurring concealer brush I love to use this to actually blend out my eyeshadow primer if you guys can see how great it just blends in that product onto your skin these these brushes are amazing I just love them so much I definitely suggest that if you haven't tried pure minerals brushes to give them a try they're really really great I'm going to set that with the leftover shiny powder and Laura Mercier powder and then move on to my Too Faced chocolate bar palette and I'm using my favorite color in this palette it's the salted caramel color and I love this color so much I love the flesh tone color of it and it just such a great color I just can't stop using it I use it every single day I've been using it so much since I've been here in LA and I just been using it so it's actually also using before I even came here but yeah I've just been using it everyday so I'm going to go into my crease and create a nice transition shade and then move on to the color milk chocolate to give my eye a little bit more depth and make it look a little bit bigger and the brush I'm using is the twenty-eighth crease brush from Kanna - it just blend in those colors together after I'm done shading the outer corner of my eye with the milk chocolate I'm going to take this bowl ATM brush in the 772 and take the color semi-sweet and this color is a little bit of a darker Brown and I'm just going to create even more depth and create even more of a shadow bringing it into the almost to the mid crease of my eye if that makes sense and just continue to shade that in now that we're done with the eye shadow we're going to move on to my eyebrows and I'm going to be using the Anasazi eye brow Wiz in the color dark brown comb through them a little bit and then give them some shape and I like to use this to just like create the shape versus using my dip brow because I like to use my dip brow I wish I am gonna be using my dipper on this as well but I like to create the shape first with my brows and then go in with my dip brow and kind of fill in those spaces this dip brow is also in the color dark brown as well and like I said before I'm just going to shade in the sparse areas that I have make my eyebrows appear a little bit thicker than they are I'd really like that thick eyebrow look it's like really popular I just I just love it what it looks on my face as well so yeah I'm just going to do that and then clean up my brows with the Maybelline dark circle eraser and my shiny concealer brush next yes I'm kind of moving ahead so like I said I'm going to be using my shady concealer brush and Maybelline dark circle eraser and the color fair I love this brush she used to clean up my brows that work so well and it just she's so awesome I love it if you guys haven't checked checked out these shiny brushes you should definitely check them out they're really great and they're inexpensive now I'm just going to be taking my powder brush and get reading up getting getting rid of all of the laura mercier and shiny powder on my face and then after I'm done with that I'm going to warm up my face with Ofra and it is their bronzer in the color bronze and gold and going to go around my face with it my forehead my cheeks and then on the lower parts of my chin and on my neck as well then blend all those in together to make sure I don't have any harsh lines then I'm going to move on to my highlight and I'm using offers you do you and I will post that in the link down below they sent this to me and I am an absolute love with it it's such a great highlighter and it's very inexpensive then I'm going to also be using Mac's soft and gentle to go over that I like to use two highlighters guys I just love to be super glowy moving on to my blush I'm going to be using B matte blush in the color Sienna and as you guys can see I have already put on my eyelashes and mascara and eyeliner I'll be posting that down below in the description as well but I'm moving on to my lips and I'm using the NYX liquid suede in the color sandstorm and I've gotten so many compliments about this lipstick everybody loves it it looks so good in person and it's just a perfect nude color I'm going to top that with Ruby kisses brown sugar they're matte lipstick and then I'm going to move on to my hair and I've this is the wig that I made a while ago it was actually a different color you guys can kind of see the different the color that was in there previously I just like dark I just want to go back dark I feel like dark looks so much better on my skin tone and so yeah I went ahead and colored it if you follow me on snapchat you saw that already yes I'm just going to fly down my hair and then I'm going to be using this edge wax by who is bye-bye memories and it is so so good it doesn't flake it's perfect like it's so so good and it really lays those edges down so if you guys can try that if you guys want to try that out you could find
