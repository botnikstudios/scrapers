hey guys it's a that since the day I filmed a very glam Valentine's Day makeup tutorial and I think this look is so so perfect for Valentine's Day it is very pink and sparkly and glowy so your dead will think you're a complete angel if you guys want to see how I achieve this look please make sure to keep on watching so for today's primer I'm gonna be using this la girl pro setting spray so I'm shouldn't be springing this all over my face and for foundation I'm taking my pure minerals a hydro fluid or water steel my foundation and then I'm gonna be taking some of this and just dyeing it all the my base and to buff this all into my face I'll be taking my Sigma flat kabuki brush and this is the f80 amber concealer I'm gonna be taking my Rebecca Stella free touch concealers I'm gonna be placing some on my under eyes and I'm going to be doing this in a triangle shape just because I really want the under eye space super super highlighted and I don't usually like to take it onto my forehead because I always feel like that's a little too much and to blend this and I'm going to be taking a damp Beauty Blender and just tapping it into my skin and I'm also going to be going in a cream contour so I'm gonna be taking my la girl Pro concealer and this is in the shade fun we see some here but here's a tip for you guys if you guys are going to be using this la girl concealer make sure that you only place product onto the places where you're going to be working on first because if you put it on all over your face if this does tend to set in really fast so I always recommend that you do the one area that you're gonna be doing first now taking some on my forehead but that said I'm going to be cleaning up this contour here and then just making lines with a concealer that we used earlier just to clean it all up and then the same thing for that bridge of my nose I'm just going go ahead and bake so for that I'm going to be using my it cosmetics powder don't they dry Beauty sponge I'm just going to be dipping it in here and just applying it to where I highlighted my face the excess power that I have in my sponge I'm going to be taking it right here in the center of my forehead because because of how I said earlier I don't litter like for it to be too intense though that will do it and then we will just wait to bake and while that is happening we are going to be applying some bronzer onto the places where we place the darker shade I'll be taking my cool a benefit bronzer and there's no surprise I love it so so much I'm going to be packing my brush with my bronzer and making sure that I get it on to every little place that's brown okay so we've been making for about 10 minutes and now I'll be taking my Sigma spotlight duster at 37 brush and I'm just going to be dusting away all the powder that we used to bake and for blush i'll be using this sigma chord the Rossa are a powder so I'll just be taking the same brush that we used to bronze up her face and just happen in there not to prime my eyes I'll be using my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion in the shade eaten so many be using this palette by Sigma it's called a smokescreen and it has a lot of nice warm brown shades and I think today I'll be going with this one here my brush I'll be using my Sigma tapered blending brush is just like 8:35 so I'll just be dipping my brush into this color here listen it go right above my crease and with the excess on my brush I will just be taking it on to my outer part of my eye and just make it a little bit more intense and opaque I'm just taking a little bit more just dabbing it in there and just really defining the outer part of my eye and now for the actual crease I'll be taking this Mahdi topi purplish grayish color here and I'll be packing my brush on with that color and taking it inside my crease and this is really just gonna help the transition shade and of the crease color just really blends together and that's going to help build a a color look a lot more flawless and see once and I'm going to be using this Sigma blending brush this is the e25 but it's flat so I'm going to be using it for my actual eyelid I'm going to be going in with this baby pink color and it has a little bit of shimmer into it but it's not too much don't the same brush I just cleaned it off a little and now I'm going to be taking this little brown color here has a little bit more shimmer onto it and I'm going to be running that on my lower lash line I kind of want to intensify the outer corner of my eye and also my lower lash line so I'll be taking this dark brown chocolate shade over here with my blending brush I'll be taking that same color and just dabbing it in there tapping off the excess and just pressing it onto the very outer part of my eye I kind of want some more dimension and sparkle into this look so in the very centers I'm going to be using this very pretty champagne pinky color and it's from the new tube the bomb palette standoffish I'll be taking some of that with my finger and just placing it in the very center of my eyelid so for today's eyeliner I'm going to be using this gel liner by cinema this is the wicked send out eyes and I'll be taking in their highly under brush this is the winged liner eo6 I never used gel liner so this is gonna be a really really intense for me so let's just hope that I don't fail so I finished Berliner and it also applied some falsies and these are the red cherry number AV twos and I love these because they're so full and plush and to blend it both my lashes together I'll be taking my Maybelline lash sensational mascara and when I apply mascara on to my lashes I always make sure that I only apply it onto the root just to blend both lashes together because I don't want to fully gunk up my lashes so I can reuse them more often so I just go from the root and blink a little now for lips I'm going to be lighting them with this colour-pop lippie pencil and this is in the shade oh snap announcer filling my lips I'll be taking this take my lipstick in the shade in spades power stick and how good to be highlighting which is my favorite part and this is my Mac oh darling woman edition highlighter and so it looks like this and I really want an intense highlight so what I'm going to be using is the spray that I used earlier as a primer and my brush just going to spritz it on the brush here and then I'm going to go ahead and dip it into my highlighter and then I'm just going to be highlighting the tops of my cheekbones this is my completed Valentine's Day makeup look
