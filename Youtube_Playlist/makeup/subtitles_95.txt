smoothing primer and i'm just going to tape with this on my hands and apply it all over my face next thing I'm going to do is go in with my foundation and when I originally did this makeup look I just using makeup forever Ultra HD foundation but I kind of want more of a matte makeup look so I went to mix the Maybelline Dream velvet foundation with my makeup forever foundation so next I'm going to be going in and color correcting I always color back to my face and I'm going to be using the NYX color correcting concealer palette a morph age 20 CO and palate I like the orange concealer shade and this one and then I'm going to be highlighting my under eyes and certain areas with my urban decay naked skin concealer and next I wish you go in and cream contour today because I want my face to be more you know structured and contoured today so I'm going to be using the NYX wonder stick in the universal shade and I'm going to contour my cheeks and other areas of my face and next I'm going to be setting my under eye concealer or baking as everyone refers to it and I'm going to be using the hoodie ariston powder that I picked up at the drugstore I have to use this once already and I do like it it has kind of an old ladyish smell to it but if you can get past that actual powder is really good man I smell like an eight year old woman but I don't care maybe they'll actually you know keep men from hitting on me tonight the reason why I'm going out tonight is my friend Pia if you're watching this Pia I'm gonna miss you she is actually moving so we're having a little like going away party kind of thing for her so yeah that's why I'm going out tonight so next I'm going to go in and set my cream contour with a powder contour and I'm going to be using benefit hoola bronzer I really like this because it's very natural looking it's not too dark and I'm already starting I'm already starting to hit pan on it I don't think I've ever like really hit pan on anything yet so this is kind of stop and I am still looking pale as hell so i am going to warm up my face a little bit with my makeup forever bronzer okay so i went ahead and did my brows and i've used the anastasia beverly hills

with this palette but it's really wearable and it's the one that I use to fill this tutorial in the picture so I'm going to use it and we try to remember the colors that I've used cuz it's been a few days I'm going to go in with this kind of quad of eyeshadows right here and I'm first going to start with the transition shade which is going to be this color right here and I'm just going to apply those of my crease next I'm going to be applying this kind of shimmery topi bronze shadow and I'm going to apply this all over my lid so next I'm going to be going in with this shade above the first transition tree that we use and I'm going to kind of darken up the crease a little bit and next I'm going to be going in with a color pop super shop shadows I love these shadows because they're not really like glitter but they just get the I like an extra something and I'm going to be using the shade millionaire and I love this color it's like a bronzy color and I really really like it so I'm just going to apply this over the shadow i already have applied on my lid and i'm going to do that with my finger because these shadows just work a little bit better with your finger I kind of like to use these shadows and more like a patting motion because I feel like if I'm swiping that I'm kind of like wiping it off you're just a very interesting texture so if you guys want you can have end that
