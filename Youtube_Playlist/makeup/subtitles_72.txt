Hey ladies welcome to my channel so today I'm gonna be doing a highly requested video decided to do a winged eyeliner tutorial then highly requested so I'm super excited to do this for you guys I hope it works out and I hope you guys enjoy and understand what's coming out of my mouth now I didn't realize how difficult this would be to film and talk through while I was filming so I decided to just do it a taco vert so if you see my mouth move in change of plans Hey ladies okay so I kind of started off with something very cat I like I kind of wanted to play around my makeup and do something that would accentuate this tutorial so I chose this really pretty cut crease and if you're interested in how I did this cut crease I could do a tutorial on that no problem it's very pretty it's all matte yeah I just thought I'd clear out my makeup and do something fun this okay so like my brow technique technique I'm going to be using two different products that people can use now you could use a gel product or liquid product I'm going to be doing these two different techniques because I don't know what you have so instead of going out and buying whatever technique I do use it will work for both so if you have a liquid liner you can do this tutorial if you have a gel you could do that as well now my favorite liquid liner is from Sephora this is jet jet black it has a brush applicator and it's really really good um has the applicator looks like this and it's just a brush tip so in this really blog the one downfall I would say for this is that if you plan on crying this will run and it will run heavy so I would not recommend you get this if you're going to be going to a wedding and you plan on crying your eyes out so don't don't use this but it's essentially it's a really really good product and it's it's pretty affordable compared to all the other products sold at Sephora and this one's called high precision liquid liner the next product I'm going to be using for my gel technique is my Inglot black gel in 77 now apparently this is the blackest gel liner on the market I really enjoy it's waterproof so if you wanted waterproof alternative if you plan on crying your eyes out at a wedding like me because I get so emotional when I see the bride yeah this is definitely a good alternative to that now currently I'm not wearing any liquid liner or mascara so let's just get on with it the first technique I'm going to show you is the gel technique now you're going to need a really thin brush applicator this is like the thinnest I could find it's from Mac and it's the 210 they have another one that's a little bit thicker but this is the most this is a very thin one and it works very well with gel liners now you can use this brush down but I don't really care to solve it the first thing you do is take some product onto the brush and kind of twist it in the product making sure the brush is properly quoted up quoted coated and kind of a movie access on a brush by twisting it on the side of the gel and you could also use the lid but yeah alright so the first thing you want to start off with is if you have a smoky eye or what not you want to make sure that the smokey eye ends where the eyeliner ends so if you're going to do a winged liner you don't want to do a winged liner and have the eye shadow smudging under the winged liner it could be your cut off to your eye shadow a really good way to to measure exactly what angle you should be applying your eyeliner on is following the end of your brows now creating that way liner you want to go ahead and go straight upwards essentially where your brow ends if you want you can go a bit lower you can go a bit higher but kind of at that angle is 45 degree angle just draw a line perfect okay so we created a line there the next thing I do is go ahead and line as closely as I can to my lash line and basically starting off in the inner middle corner and just kind of covering my lashes and if you have a really unsetting hand you can hold the brush closer to the tip and make smaller strokes this will help apply the product better on to your eye now that I've lined the eye closest to the lash line from the inner corner to the mid end of my eye there's a little gap right here and you want to make sure that it matches up perfectly now the trick is to create a straight line from the edge of the wink all the way to the to the people of your eye so I don't know if that makes sense does that make sense I make sure the end of the wing goes straight down into the middle of the liner I'm just going to bring the product in and go straight down you you Heys and for this last step I'm going to use my pinkie to kind of stretch out my inner tear duct area and drag the product sharply down the inner tear duct area okay so for this next technique I'm going to be using my liquid liner and this technique is my go-to technique I like this technique much better than the first one because it takes less time and I'm just very Swift with it but then again you do need product I mean so you do need practice what you're going to do is take the brush and kind of dab off the extra extra product off the brush making sure that the there's not it's not like goofing off of the brush now you're going to go ahead and create that straight line like we mentioned in the first technique going upwards and then I'm going to feather out words lightly so it gives me a sharper edge and once I do that I'm just going to take it and drag it back down to the inner section of my eye in a straight line and if you mess this up it's okay you could you could clean it up by just creating a little bit of a thicker wing but it does take practice now once you've filled in the intersection of the eye you want to take that same brush and make sure that you just straighten that line like I'm doing you by using smaller strokes and just covering the lashline of your entire eye as you do this you also want to make sure that it's matching up with the way and again for the inner corner you're going to want to drag your tear duct area stretch it out with your opposite thumb and bring the product down in to your tear duct area I like doing this because my eyes are kind of far apart so it brings them closer together so this is the finished tutorial I hope you enjoyed it and I hope it was easy to follow so this video has
