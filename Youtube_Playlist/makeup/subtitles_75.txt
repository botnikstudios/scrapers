hey guys so welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be one of my most requested videos actually it is my top favorite best morphe brushes that I think are totally worth the money and which ones I think that you need to go out and buy just to have a good like set of morphe brushes not necessarily set but having your own like good amount of morphe brushes you know I'm saying this is the thing about working brushes they are all so cost-efficient amazing quality like frickin like Mac and Sigma status like quality and they're so so so so so cheap like they're so good dry brushes range from like 3 to like 7 bucks like they're just amazing and I've been getting so many requests because I use them all the time another great thing about working is I have a code with them it is the Commission code so I do make a small Commission if you guys use my code but you guys don't have to use my code if that's not your thing you guys don't like to do like no Commission thing or like buying things using codes and stuff like that then it's all good you don't have to do that I'm just saying you get 10% off if you use my code mani anyway in all caps 10% off the entire site so I think that's pretty good lying you guys it if you want I'm you don't have to if I can do it oh by the way if you don't like it we know we know the drill so we're going to put this up into two categories we're gonna do face ones I'm ready to I ones I'll leave both face I you want to get to them let's do face ones first cuz you're gonna take the longest are you fuckin first we're gonna talk about is my face foundation brush I use all the time if you guys see me doing a face tutorial with besides using like a Beauty Blender I'm using this brush this is the m43 9 basically what I love about this brush is that it's extremely extremely thick and dense and the applies foundation so beautifully it gives you a flawless finish and gives you more of like an airbrushed finish because it's so dense as you can see it's a very very dense foundation never gets down to here like ever ever we're just gonna do the bitch to clean it's a nice big brush it's great for my man face for me too like a brush that's a foundation brush with a kabuki brush I think this one is absolutely amazing obviously you have a smaller face than me you're gonna love it too but I'm just saying it works great with my big aunt thing it's perfect so for concealer I love this brush this is the m33 5 which is basically the small baby version of the last one I just talked about it is so adorable besides okay obviously what is it besides being adorable how you love to use this for concealer for the under-eye concealer to really blend out the excess product I don't need there honestly like I need to do is put a little bit by the eye doesn't it under that buff it out and this one does an amazing amazing job with it it's also a very dense brush and it's just it's small its tightening it's perfect it fits under the eye I think it's absolutely amazing it's a steal if you guys are into more like cream contouring and stuff it's fantastic at getting into the contours and the holes of the face and buffing out as well this is just a great buffing brush just like the other one is but a much smaller baby version of it so I know me okay let's talk about another one that I think is amazing for the under eye area this one is the morphe g2 which is basically like this tapered foundation brush is another very dense brush as you can tell I'm very much into buffing brushes as you can see what I like about the g2 so much is that it also takes away concealer beautifully you can apply concealer and you can take out we can see there so well with this brush but it's also great at highlighting I use this in my cream contour like review of the new Anastasio cream contour kits pretend this is the palette and I like that I applied I can use it from foundation you can use it for contouring I love that its taper at the end too so you can technically go in and contour with this or you can just use it for the under-eye concealing or highlighting or anything like that it's big enough where you get a good nice variety and you can get a larger conference at one time but it's not like two big words like like m4 3/9 definitely so on that so I think it's just a great brush you get a lot of control of this brush and it reminds me a lot of the Sigma tapered one which is a lot cheaper and a lot more just cost-efficient and I think it's great next one is gonna be the morphe g3 which is basically this doing so funny I was cracking up because like all my brushes that I'm like showing you guys are basically like dirty cuz I use them today to do my makeup and I was thinking oh my gosh I'd wash the brushes for them like I want anything about dirty bitch and I don't wash my brushes and stuff yeah but then I thought you know what like obviously I'm got tougher brushes that I use all the time why not just show them dirty like so you guys to know that I do use them all the time I do some today so okay sorry if you're not into that dirty shit but I am basically this brush is meant for cream contouring or powder contouring basically which every um I love about it is that it's such a dense also type of kabuki brush but the paddle is flat as you can see it's a completely flat brush and it's so amazing at getting into the hall the face and buffing in cream or liquid or powder anything like that it's so good at buffing out like a contour highlight or anything like that this one is one of my top favorite brushes I use one nearly every day every single time I use my makeup I use this one because I love it for contouring it's so good it just it's right amount of denseness it picks up product and beautifully it buffs up product beautifully it is so worth the money I love the the gunmetal series is one my favorite for more for you the good metals are just so good they're so good I love love love it now we're gonna talk about the m4 38 this brush I use literally in like I think every single tutorial I've done like a face thing I've used this brush this brush is my life so what I love about this one is that I use it for the under eye setting this brush is so pretty because it's so long it's perfect I getting underneath the eye my gosh it okay like this is the perfect under eye setting brush it's so soft it's dense enough where it picks up product beautifully and a lay style product really nicely as well and it doesn't put down too much I love to like go in with a powder get it with the powder and just kind of run it in there and dust off the excess off using my ring and then just kind of go in and set my under eye with it this brush is absolutely amazing this is just like it's one of my favorite brushes I've ever gotten from more feet ever ever I use it all the time beautiful at setting under eye makeup concealer anything like a nice one to my face once the next special mint aqua is the g8 brush this one I love love-love-love because it's also a flat brush very similar to the other one though talking about the contouring one but it's like a flat and it's tapered at the end I personally use those from blush all the time it gets tapered off on the sides out if you guys can tell but the way that bristles are cut it gives you a nice paper but they're extremely soft so if you want to go in would stick a little bit of blush you can just go on the tip and blend in and if you want to go in with a lot you can just press the whole brush into the blush and just go ham go ahead with that blush dude it's amazing it's amazing it's amazing amazing it's amazing it's all me scene and the last face we're gonna talk about is the morphe g7 basically just your everyday powder brush the reason I love this powder brush is that it's so thick I use this for bronzer I use this for powder raises for anything to do with powdering like my neck powdering my face and you can do with it I use this it's dense enough but it's not too dense where you lay down a shit out of powder and you look cakey so that's why I love this one so so so much it just gives you such a wide circumference like okay how it looks on my face it covers a good amount you know I mean so I go in with the bronzer on here not really just kind of dust in the bronzer into my face if I just want to go with Mormon bronzy look and same with powder I'll just kind of go down my neck just to kind of match it with my face a little bit I think that this brush is amazing if you're looking for a good powder brush that is high-quality that's not gonna pick up too much powder but it's gonna lay a good amount down try the g-seven it's amazing it's so amazing forgive that it's dirty I used it today obviously so now we're gonna go ahead move on to the eye brushes this is the eyebrows portion I have five brushes in the eye brush section as to me having seven in the face ones but I think a good couple high brushes will take you so so so so so far so far so damn far so we're going to start from the smallest to the biggest this one they just launched I just got it literally yesterday and it's the morphe M 508 which is this tiny um I'd use it today it's seriously like this brush is like revolutionary for me this one is so amazing at getting underneath your under eye area because it's so so so freaking tiny goanna getting underneath the lash line that's what I use it for I think this is amazing if you're into putting shadow underneath your eye and underneath your lashes this brush is so crucial it's not too stiff where you pick up so much product and you deposit so much product but it since it's so tiny it's amazing and getting underneath the lashes and really kind of buffing out the product thing it's literally like four bucks I honestly I don't know how morphe you guys I don't know how they forget survive I don't know how they do it I really don't amazing brush it's amazing let's go ahead and move on to the next one we're gonna go ahead and talk about the morphe 320 brush which is this this flat brush this brush is crucial for people and the reason I think it's cause I have three of Emily and I'm getting a three this brush is an amazing flat dense packing brush I use this with loose pigment uses with eyeshadow I use this with glitter ie you can use this brush with anything because it's so dense picks up product amazingly ended posits amazingly since and synthetic it doesn't like Harbert and your product in the brush I use this today to apply like my lid color that's why it's dirty fact that is pointed you have so much control and you can like really get up to that crease like where you want it to stop already wanting to keep going everyone needs a good packing brush especially one that's really dense I think the 320 is amazing for that okay cool next brushes let's go ahead and do the next one this one is the M for three three you guys know I use this in literally every single tutorial since I've got it it is basically the equivalent of a Mac 217 or Sigma e25 I think this one is just as good and it's literally like $5.99 I think or six bucks it's a white go hairbrush do you guys are interested in like did Mac 217 or Sigma e25 try this one out first if you guys like it I think the m4 33 is a main zing so worth the price likes okay two more I remember them the morphe M 505 which they just launched this one is I love this one so much I just got yesterday till I just until time this one is basically a tapered blending brush it reminds me very much of the Sigma e-40 but a tapered version of it what I love on spur so much is that it's so amazed at literally getting in to like the crevice of your eye depositing color and blending it out right then in there I was waiting for more food creative brush that's very very very very soft pointed and it's great at getting in the crease of your eye amazing a buffing amazing at blending amazing at depositing color this special is just mom it's so bomb look how cute it is I'm getting me fucking adorable last but not least darling last not least the morphe m4 for one with basically a large fluffy version of the m4 three three this is a great fluffy brush just applying any kind of shadow into the crease or if you want to do like a whole lid color this is just a great fluffy brush that I think is just one of those crucial fluffy brushes it's like the Sigma e-40 just the white go here version of it very soft bomb.com so yes that was it for my favorite morphe brushes
