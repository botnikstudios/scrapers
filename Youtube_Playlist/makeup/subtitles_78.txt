hey everyone I missed you guys so so so much because I have not sat down and from the video in the longest time and wow this past month so much has happened and I this month was so crazy to me and I don't know what like I don't even know where to begin to explain myself where I have been about firstly I just want to mention two things thank you so much for the 100,000 subscribers on my channel oh my gosh I just cannot believe it because I never in a million years have thought I would reach 100,000 subscribers like this fad I just feel so incredibly lucky to just reach such a big milestone because I don't know like I started off filming with my iPhone I started this channel the reason I've been gone for so long is because the beginning of December I went to Hawaii for ten days and I didn't vlog a little bit so I'll probably put up a mini video and just like post it on youtube if you guys want to see it I don't know but that was honestly one of the best experiences of my life the main reason why I did not upload a video is because my camera broke my camera broke the beginning of December and I tried to return it and the whole like Canon thing it was just such a hassle so I just send it over to Canon for them to fix it so that took a long time and I just got my camera back today I want to mention something really fast I have eyelash extensions on this is my second time getting them done the first time I went to all so long it was just like super last-minute I would trust a lot of they literally put like ten eyelashes on each eye oh yeah so then I went to professional lady and she got them she she did them for me so I had these for like a week already one week already and I still love them so much so I don't even wear makeup look I have been put a makeup in a long time falafels I want to do a baking tutorial because I just kind of want to put on makeup I'm just going to show you guys today how I do my foundation how I highlight and contour and I'm going to zoom you guys in so you guys can see a better view so I'm going to be starting out with clean skin and I'm one to use this facial spray with aloe and herbs and rosewater and is just gonna really help moisturize my skin and yeah it feels really refreshing so I'm just gonna spray that all over my face and then for the primer I'm gonna take the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer and that's the consistency of it and basically makes my face look very glowy and dewy and that's what I like to have since my skin is very dry especially in the winter time so I just used one pump of this and apply it all over my face anyways for my favorite part I'm taking Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick foundation and this is in the shade 118 and I absolutely love this foundation because it's a cream consistency but it gives me a dewy effect and if you are oily you can just set it with the translucent powder and you're good to go so I absolutely love this foundation so what I do is I just take this foundation and glide across my cheeks and the center of my face as well as the perimeters of my face and then I take this furless cosmetics brush and this is called see me - and what I do with this foundation is I just kind of buffed the makeup away in circular motions and I also press the product into my skin and push outwards I don't know if that makes sense but anyways this foundation has a medium to full coverage is definitely buildable and it's definitely dewy so if you have oily skin I'm not sure if you guys are going to like this product but definitely give it a try and set it with a mattifying powder if you guys do try it I love how this foundation comes and you stick form because it just makes it really easy to touch up throughout the day if you do need any touch-ups and the fact that it's a cream it just blends in with the rest of your makeup really flawlessly now this is a new product I've been testing out but this is the Becca under-eye corrector and basically apply this before your concealer and it's supposed to correct the darkness under your eyes and since I have a lot of darkness and pigmentation under my eyes I like to use this before my concealer so what I do is I just take a small amount on my ring finger and just Pat it right underneath where I have that blue grayish dark circles and as you guys can see it just really brightens up the under eye area and when I apply concealer we'll just you'll just have a lot more coverage and it just looks really nice so I just take a small amount and just pop that right underneath you don't want to apply too much because this product can increase so you just want to use a small amount and then let your concealer do the rest of the work so I'm basically going to be using the UH Nastasia cream contour kit in light today and this is my sister's but I've never used on myself before but I'm taking these two highlighting shades and I'm just applying it underneath my eyes in a triangle shape and I'm using a found any foundation brush this is synthetic so you just want to use very light strokes and you just want to spread this product evenly and try not to take up too much because this is a Korean product and it can look very heavy okay so now you wanna do the same exact thing to the other side okay because that would just look really weird if you didn't so okay I'm sorry for the moment I just had with my cousin but anyways I'm just applying the rest of the highlighter on my chin and my Cupid's bow just to help balance everything out and this will also help my upper lip look fuller and my chin look a little bit brighter as well and then just kind of cover up the darkness around my mouth that we all tend to have and then I'm taking the highlighter on my forehead as well because my Florida is a lot smaller and I like to brighten it up a bit and just add a little bit more highlight on the corners of my mouth okay now I'm going to mix these two darker shades to bronze slash contra with and I don't know why I just tapped off the excess because it is a cream product but anyways I'm just so lightly dabbing from the product the temples by the way sorry my cousin we're gonna stop I am just placing this darker cream the perimeter of my face and then I'm also taking it through the hollow of my cheekbones and if you guys don't know where your cheekbone is it's the top of your ears to the corner of your mouth and you want to stop halfway so the line doesn't go all the way to the corner of your mouth because then that way you can look rain buddy and natural so you just kind of want to stop halfway and then I take this contour as you guys can see just bring it up a little because then it creates a much more slimming effect and decimal point of contouring was is to create illusions and it helps make your face appear a lot slimmer and that's exactly what I need because my face is a lot more of an oval shape and I like to have a lot of dimension and all that stuff going on and then you also want to apply some on the tip of your nose and the bottom of your lip and it's just really creates illusion of a fuller bottom lip and I'm taking my foundation brush and just kind of busting away the harsh edges I don't like a strong contour on my face shape so I just like to blend it out blend up edges a bit more just so it looks a little bit more natural so you want to grab your Beautyblender or any kind of sponge that you may have and I'm just pressing that onto my skin and just to help the makeup blend and the beauty blender also picks up any excess makeup that may be sitting on top of your skin so we prevents the cakey look so as you can see I'm just kind of going over my face and just making sure everything is nicely blended and I'm also making sure that the concealer did not crease so you wanted you just want to do that a couple times before you set your makeup so now I'm taking one of my favorite concealer this is the Maybelline age rewind concealer and light and what I'm gonna do with this concealer is just place place it right underneath my eyes where I need a bit more coverage and I'm not gonna use a lot of this because I did correct earlier and used honest thoughts with cream contour kit and I'm taking that same sponge and I'm just gonna Pat this underneath my eyes because I did not want to disturb the highlighting shades and the corrector so you just want to Pat this just to get the most coverage and so just everything stays in place and then I just go over everything one last time before I set it and then I'm using the banana luxury powder and cameo and this is one of I actually like this a lot better than the Laura Mercier powder and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bake my concealer and I'm just pressing that Beauty Blender into the powder and then I'm just gonna dab the powder right underneath my eyes and I'm just gonna let this powder sit like for two to three minutes actually and what its gonna do is it's just gonna really set that concealer and that makeup and it's gonna help the makeup lasts a lot longer throughout the day so you just want to apply this through the areas where you highlighted so I'm taking the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills contour kit and I'm taking that flan shade and the reason why I'm contouring after I'm baking is because I want my contour to look a lot more softer and I don't want it to be a harsh line so as I am contouring I'm also buffing away the product that I used to set my makeup so you guys are gonna see it right here really quick so as you can see I'm just dusting away the powder as I go I find it a lot more natural-looking if you do it this way but it's definitely up to you guys how you like your contract you like it to be more natural or stronger so I'm taking the Real Techniques setting brush and I'm just dusting away the powder that is underneath wise the reason why I'm using a new powder brush is because I don't want the contouring shades like the fawn that we used earlier to really mix it with the powder that we used underneath our eyes and I don't want the color to change so you just want to make sure you use a clean a brush for this step then I'm taking benefit hoola bronzer this is my second box already and this is honestly one of my favorite bronzers ever and I'm just gonna contour with this now so what I'm doing is I'm just using your brush in circular motions and blending and the product up as I go and then you also want to get your jawline and the temples just so everything ties in nicely together now I'm just taking the foundation brush we used earlier and I'm just patting over the edges of my bronzer just to help minimize any harsh lines streakiness and also helps the bronzer blend in with my skin a lot easier now for my blush I'm taking NARS orgasm and a small duo fiber brush and I'm just gonna use circular motions and blunt upwards just to get a nice wash of color so basically I'm just doing the kissy face and where you see your cheekbones pop out that's where you want to apply your blush and now I'm just casually gonna open my mouth and just apply my girls no you cannot have your mouth closed and apply your lower lash mascara now I'm just taking mag soft and gentle highlighter and makeup addiction cosmetics precision highlighting brush and we're just going to highlight our cheekbones our brow bone our nose and our Cupid's bow and you want to pack this highlight on I usually always switch out my highlighters but recently I've just really been loving back soft and gentle I don't because since ever since I've got a tan I just feel like it's been showing up on my skin tone a lot more so I like to use it while I can so you can obviously use any kind of highlighter you guys prefer and then to finish off this look I'm just taking a pistachio Beverly Hills liquid lipstick and pure Hollywood this is just my favorite go-to nude lipstick and I just like to use it when I do not know what to wear on my lips and I just go for this one cuz it lasts long all day and after I'm done with my makeup I'm just gonna spray my skin one last time and that is the completed look thank you guys so much for watching bye guys
