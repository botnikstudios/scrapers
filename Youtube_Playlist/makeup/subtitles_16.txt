so before I start doing my makeup I want to share with you guys the products that I've been using for my skincare not that it has changed but you guys keep requesting it so I'm going to show it to you guys so I start off by washing my face with my daily face wash I would list it down description box below there's no specific name for it after I towel dry my face I like to go in with this daily serum that I've been using for over a month I saw it in my friends Channel and I really wanted to try it out and it's made up of things that are specifically needed for my face so that's what I like about it it also has microbeads in it so it makes it really nice and easy for you to exfoliate your face while you're putting it on your face so afterwards I just washed it off and then apply my favorite moisturizer which I've been using for a really long time now and if I see a pimple coming out the first thing that I do is apply this lotion that my dermatologist actually gave me ELISA Danton scription box below I like to put it either 20 minutes before stores with my makeup or before I go to bed Mikey boy wanted to say hi today so I brought him on camera for you guys so that is pretty much today let's go ahead and get started with the fun part our makeup go ahead and do my eyebrows I'm using a bra with by Anastasia Beverly Hills in the shape dark brown and I'm also going to apply her brow gel which is amazing for taming your hair to prime my eyelids I'm gonna go in with my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion in the shade Eden and I'm just going to apply this all over the lid you guys know the deal I absolutely love this then I'm just going to set it with a neutral shade from the Tarte pad that I've been talking about for over a month here on my channel and on snapchat and I'm just going to apply this all over the lid afterwards I'm going to take this camel shade and ie 38 brush by Sigma and I'm just going to apply this on my crease taking this dark brown shade and the same brush that we use on our crease I'm going to apply this on my outer crease just to intensify the look a little bit more and I do want the look to be warm so that's why I'm taking a dark brown shade to smoke out the look I'm going to take an e25 brush by Sigma and a black shade from the Tarte palette and I'm just going to apply this only on the outer parts of my V to warm up the look a little bit more I'm going to take this beautiful warm shade and a sigma e40 brush and I'm just going to apply this in my crease and just make sure that everything is blended in really nice to highlight my brow bone I'm going to apply this beautiful neutral shade on my lid today I want to use a really nice neutral shade so I'm going to go on up with this vanilla colored eyeshadow from the Tarte palette and I'm going to apply this all over my lid four eyelashes today I'm gonna go in with my Koko lashes and goddess this is the first time I think I'm applying my eyelashes such dramatic eyelashes with my hands and I did an amazing job you guys I am so proud of myself because apply your eyelashes with your fingers sometimes can be a little bit difficult that's why I use a tweezer a tweezer is best for beginners now going into my face I'm going to go in with a my makeup forever a mattifying primer and I'm just going to Pat this on the center of my face for foundation today I'm gonna go in with my Becca cosmetics ever matte foundation and I'm going to apply this with a Beauty Blender to highlight my face today I went in with my mac prolongwear concealer which I've just got yesterday and it's my favorite this is like the fifth one I purchased and I have it in the shade NC 25 and I'm just blending that in with my Beauty Blender to contour my face today I'm going to be using my NARS Itoh brush and I'm using my Kat Von D shade + light contour kit I didn't realize that I grabbed the wrong foundation because I have this foundation in three different shades and my shade right now is nude and I actually grabbed no ice set which is much lighter so that's why I had to really go in and bronze up my skin a ton so before you guys are saying that the foundation is a little bit too light for me I know it was my mistake I grabbed the wrong foundation so please be nice and I went in with my Too Faced bronzer which is the darkest one and I absolutely love it especially to warm up your face this is a great bronzer going in with my favorite blush I'm going to just apply this on the apples of my cheeks for highlight today I wanted to use my so hollywood by anastasia beverly hills illuminator i've really been loving this highlight it is absolutely stunning it's a straight up gold highlight and it shows up beautifully on tanned and medium skin tones and then for my lips i went in it with a new lip liner that i just got em mac yesterday actually went to the store and picked up a few things that i was missing and this was one of it this is a new lip liner from their new line I believe the vamper fight line and I love it it's a deep ruby color and it's perfect for the fall time it's absolutely gorgeous you can wear by itself or you can top it off with a liquid lipstick to make sure that it stays in place for the rest of the day I went in with a colour-pop liquid lipstick in the colour LAX and I just applied it in the center because I didn't like the fact that you can see the inside of my lid and then I'm going to apply some eyeliner in my waterline as well to my tight line and then I'm going to apply some mascara to my lower lashes and that is pretty much it this is a final look I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching don't forget to give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and if you want to see more kit ready with
