I'm not trying to show you love and affection I'm trying to live the life a kid always expect is a big is a visit music hey guys welcome back to my channel so today is going to be a Netflix and chill makeup tutorial and I know what you're thinking not the nasty Netflix and chill like none of that just actually chilling like a more chill makeup look whether you want to watch Netflix with your bottle of wine with your friends or like me me and Molly my dog just hanging out or you know something just more casual I've been wearing this look a lot recently because I still look put together but it's not the crazy wink liner or smokey eye it's a lot more low-key for me and you can even make it more minimal than what I did but this is my more chill makeup look that I usually gravitate towards and every time I wear on snapchat or Instagram I always get tons of requests for a tutorial so I wanted to do it today because I know I've been doing a lot more glam look so I wanted to keep it a little bit more low-key today and I loved how much you can switch up this makeup look if you wanted to pair this look with a dark red lip automatically it's gonna look more glam or if you want to keep it more low-key you can add just a lip balm or not do lashes there's so many options you can do with this look and I think that's why I love it so much because I have so much freedom with colors and things I want to switch out with this tutorial so I really really hope you guys enjoy it if you do recreate it don't forget to tag me so if you want to see how I get this Netflix and chill makeup look then just keep watching so first I'm going to take some of this Eddy in facial spray all over it feels so good it just like refreshes your skin and preps it and it just feels amazing and especially during winter time when my skin gets a little bit drier I like to use this so I'm going to take a little bit of Mac soft over Paint Pot just some on my finger to prime my eyelids I'm not using really any eyeshadow today but it does even up my eyelids and makes everything look 1 tone because my eyelids like you can see they're a little bit darker so I'm going to go ahead and curl my lashes because this look is really just about highlight lashes color and then I'm taking the L'Oreal telescopic mascara and I'm going to apply this this is my favorite drugstore mascara makes your lashes so so long so while that dries we're going to move on to the face first I'm going to prime my face with these Smashbox primer water for my foundation I'm using the Maybelline matte and poreless with my Beauty Blender I told you guys is my current favorite foundation I have not been able to put it down I just like to start on the outside of my face and work inwards and a little bit of this foundation goes a long way it blends so easily I like tons of redness around my nose and it just covers everything up it's 64 degrees today that's insane it's December I always like to blend a little bit down my neck too just to make sure there's no demarcation line so now I'm going to fill in my brows I'm using the Anastasia brow Wiz in dark brown I'm going to kind of speed through this because it's just how I always do but I like to start on the bottom part of the brow make my little arch kind of feather the front up a little bit you use really light strokes you don't want to put a lot of pressure towards the front you don't want it to look really harsh and then I take the brush and I brush the hair downwards just so I can kind of see the shape I want on the top I've been doing a straighter brow recently and I really like it so for my lashes I'm using lashes in the city from the lower these are the lashes I've been wearing and all of my pictures on a dream where I've done this look and I wear them all the time without any eyeshadow or anything and they just look so full and wispy and I love them one of the keys to wearing lashes is letting the glue dry you want the lash glue to get tacky before you try to apply them or else you just keep pushing it and it doesn't stick on the lashes so I let mine dry for 30 seconds before I apply I'll squeeze the false lashes and my natural lashes together while I'm like pushing it on the lash line just to get it as close as possible sometimes I'll take a felt tip eyeliner I have this one from eiko and I'll go over the band it just depends on how the lash glue dries so I'm going to let the lash glue dry and see if I need to so moving on to concealer I'm going to take the NYX HD concealer in the shade of beige to highlight and also cover up any dark circles I'm just going to blend it out with my Beauty Blender then I'm going to set my concealer with the mat shaping powder in the shade of the size and this brush from morphe this is the more feet m4 3/8 you just want to Pat it underneath the eye so you don't disrupt and move the concealer you just want to set it and this also brightens up the concealer a little bit more so I'm gonna take this nude eyeliner from NARS and that same brush just to hold down my lash line so I don't mess up my concealer I'm going to fill in my waterline with this color it just makes your eyes look a lot brighter a lot more awake and a little bit thicker so I'm going to be trying out the new chart contour chart tardies tart TARDIS TARDIS it comes with two contour shades to correcting highlight shades a blush shade and I believe this is a shimmer highlight color it smells so good smells like cocoa like the Too Faced chocolate stuff that's what smells like we're going to start with this contour color apply a little bit right here right there look good then I'm going to switch to this morphe fluffy brush and take the lighter contour color to blend it out and they set this I need two oranges so I'm going to take two colors for my blush they're both from Mac they're mineralized colors first I'm going to take out pine bronze on a duo fiber brush and I'm just going to apply that right over my contour then I'm going to mix some of a warm sole right on top so for my highlight I'm going to take champagne pop from Becca and I'm going to apply that right on the high points of my cheeks then to make it a little bit more fleeky i'm going to take some of mary lou manizer from the balm it's a lighter champagne color and apply it right on top if you can't see my highlight in the dark then there's something wrong with it and then I'm going to take some of that on the inner corners as well Loen all day I'm going to finish off the eyes with mascara I'm going to use the Rimmel lash accelerator on the lower lashes this is my favorite mascara for lower lashes it's the only one that I've used it doesn't like bleed have to be so careful when I'm doing my mascara on my lower lashes I feel like I always screw it up so now I'm going to set my face with the urban decay DEET slick setting spray so now I'm going to go to change and fix my hair and when I come back I will finish with the lip color so for my lip color I'm going to start off with makeup forever lipliner and a shade 3c so I'm going to be mixing a few different lip glosses today and I want them to show up true to color so I'm going to be taking this lippy stick from colour-pop in the shade skimpy it's a really pale nude and I'm going to apply this all over so that way my lips are a little bit more muted though it's kind of like mist from Mac is what it reminds me of so I'm going to start with a little bit of rose from dose of colors I think this has glitter in it because the texture is kind of gritty I don't really like the texture of this gloss but I love the color of it so you look like a bobby rose color and then I'm actually going to apply a little bit of Mack Flor abundance right on top this is more of like a peachy nude color so here's the finished look I really hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and to subscribe to my channel if you did now I'm
