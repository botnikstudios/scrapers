hey everyone and welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to achieve this really soft natural eye look with this bold brown chocolate lip [Music] [Music] to get started today I'm gonna be priming my skin with my Mac natural radiance primer I absolutely love this primer it gives off such a smooth finish and really hydrates any dry areas so I love this for the autumn and winter then I'm taking the L'Oreal infallible 24 hour foundation I absolutely love this foundation I'm just applying it all over the skin I really wanted a nice fullest coverage today and this definitely does do that I did want to apply it with a sponge though just because I feel that when I apply it with a brush it does give off quite a cakey finish so this just really helps to blend it in really seamlessly so I definitely say if you are gonna be wearing this foundation it works really well with a sponge [Music] next I'm just gonna be priming my eyes with some concealer this is the Maybelline age rewind concealer I've been loving to use this as an eye primer recently just because I feel like it's a lot lighter on my eyes my eyes can sometimes tend to get a little bit dry and I just feel like this can be a lot less harsh on my eyes rather than the Paint Pot sometimes and I'm also just making sure to set it so that it doesn't move for my eyes today I'm gonna be taking the Urban Decay Naked 1 palette and taking the color naked I'm gonna be taking this on a big fluffy blending brush and just taking this into the crease and making sure to blend this really well I wanted to create a really natural soft eye today just because the lip is so bold you can totally go for a darker eye if you want to but I did want to keep it as simple as possible so I'm just going for two Mac colors in the crease and one shimmery color on the lid and that's it and next I'm gonna be taking me color buck and I'm gonna apply that more towards the outer be area just to add a little bit of definition to the eyes and also just to lift them a little bit without adding too much darkness like it's not too dark it's still looks really soft and is appropriate for daytime and I am also going back into that previous brush just to make sure that color is really nice and well blended next I'm taking the color virgin and I'm gonna apply this all over the lid I'm using my finger just because I do feel like this does spread out the product evenly without it being too harsh I just wanted to swipe this color on really softly [Music] next I'm gonna apply some false lashes this is totally optional you can go for some natural false lashes or even your own lashes I just really wanted to apply some because we are going for such a bold lip and I do feel like it kind of balances out things really well and I just love these lashes these are the ILA 1 to 6 lashes I've been using these constantly I just feel like it's the perfect amount of volume and length and I just love the way this enhances my eyes so I'm just applying them with some glue and tweezers [Music] I did feel like it needed a little bit of liner so I'm taking my soap and glory super cat liner and I'm just drawing a line on the top of the lash band I'm not gonna be winging out the line or anything I'm just gonna be applying a line of eyeliner and that's it this is just gonna enhance my eyes a little bit more and just give it a little bit more depth [Music] next I'm just gonna apply some mascara to my top lashes just to make them blend into the false ones a little bit better next I'm just gonna be applying some concealer this is the Maybelline fit me concealer you guys know I love this concealer by now it's definitely my favorite I'm just applying it under the eyes on my forehead the bridge of my nose and also on my chin this is not only going to conceal but it's also going to highlight as well so it's just going to give us a really nice highlighted face and really bring those areas forward [Music] to blend that in I'm gonna be using the Beauty Blender again just to make sure that it blends really seamlessly into the rest of my complexion we don't see any harsh lines and the beauty blender does that absolutely flawlessly I absolutely love the finish that a beauty blender gives I don't use a sponge all the time but when I do I just always love the way that my foundation comes out [Music] and also just to blend out these smaller areas I'm gonna be using my finger just to help me out a little bit and also just to get into all those little areas that the sponge can't reach next I'm gonna be setting all the areas I applied the concealer I'm gonna be using my soap &amp; Glory instant retouch powder I know surprise surprise it's definitely my favorite powder so I'm sorry I'm using the same powder all the time but I just absolutely love this one and if you can get your hands on it I definitely recommend that everyone buys this because you will not regret it it's an amazing powder and then taking a larger brush I'm just gonna go on the rest of the face as well just so that my bronzer and everything will gone really seamlessly and everywhere is zapped next I'm just gonna do my eyebrows off camera just because you guys have seen me do it a million times but I will put my eyebrow tutorial down in the description box for you next I'm just gonna take a little bit of that buck color from that palette and just apply it onto the bottom lash line taking some more of that virgin shade that we applied on the lead and just take a small brush and apply it on the inner corner to open up our eyes and then I'm just taking a nude pencil and just applying it to our waterline this will just make our eyes appear a lot brighter and also open them up as well and then to finish off the eye look I'm just gonna be taking some mascara just to it really balance the top and the bottom lashes [Music] next I'm gonna start bronzing my skin I am using the Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light it's been a while since this bronzer has made an appearance but I definitely love this bronzer I stopped using it because I was running out and I didn't want to finish it so I blew it out again because I love using this kind of color for the winter time it's not totally yellow toned it does have a little bit more of that bez tone so it is nice up for the winter so I just prefer using this kind of color in the winter so just applied that all over the outer perimeter of my face and then taking hoola bronzer by benefit I'm just contouring the cheekbones just to give my face a little bit more definition I'm also using that same hoola to contour my nose a little bit as well [Music] for my blush today I'm gonna be taking Mac warm so and just applying a tiny little bit on my cheekbones just to give myself a little bit of color [Music] and then to highlight I'm gonna be using the laura geller gilded honey highlighter I absolutely love this and I'm just applying a fairly small amount nothing too much on the cheekbones and also on the tip of my nose and for the lips today for the star of the show this is definitely the main attraction of this look I'm gonna be using Matt chestnut pencil all over the lips now I wasn't sure what kind of brown I wanted to go if for this look but I definitely knew I wanted to go for a brown just because I have seen so many brown shades recently and I personally have never done this on my channel before and I've actually don't think I've ever worn this kind of color before so I just knew I had to do it at least once and I actually really loved it I think I'll be doing this color a lot more I just lined all of my lips with it and then also filled in although I did make sure to moisturize my lips before hands just because this can be very drying so guys that is the end of this makeup tutorial I hope that you enjoyed although it is something a little bit more simple it's definitely something I love you guys were requesting a more simple eyelet with a bold lip you can totally substitute the brown for any lip color you want I just really wanted to do something a little bit different I didn't want to do something typical like the dark purple I do sometimes and also red I wanted to change up a little bit and if you haven't tried brown I definitely recommend it because although I'm not a bold lip person I am loving this if you did enjoy this video then please give it a thumbs up because it does help me out a ton and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I put new videos up three times a week and follow me on all social media too i am on twitter facebook instagram and snapchat all under makeup by laila i hope you all have an amazing day i can't wait to see you guys in my next video and i will talk to you later bye guys [Music] [Music] poetry crazy world corners [Music] crazy reach down
