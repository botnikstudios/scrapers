hey Miu nice I don't know if you guys follow me on Instagram but I recently hold a new ATAR palette and I wanted to use that today and I put this look together and I really liked the way it came up so enjoy let's get started and I'm going to give you with my bare face but don't run away my dry desert face sneeze priming and moisturizing so I use these products and I'm using oil sell lip treatment and for my foundation today I'm going to use NARS sheer glow foundation in Punjab and applying that everywhere on my lids like dotting Dammam and I'm going to buff it out with Real Techniques expert face brush and for concealing and highlighting I'm using NARS radiant creamy concealer in vanilla 1 and I'm blending that out with a blending blender blending blender Beauty Blender this dish is real magic I am loving it and I'm using emphasize and banana powder from a nostalgia skit to set my under eye concealer I'm using hourglass diffuse light powder on the high points of my face and where I apply my concealer this is a perfect topper for the under eye area and avoids any fallouts from sticking on to your face next obviously I need to do my brows and I'm going to fill them in using brow Wiz from anistar just and this is the color in soft brown you used to use her dip brow or her brow powder but this has been my go-to way to do it it's easier faster and quicker okay and then I'm just going to fill them in also I'm using brow gel clear one from our line best brow gel ever keeps my hair in place all day long if you have long crazy brow hairs like me you need to get this you will thank me later okay I'm going to carve my brows and I'm using Smacks studio finish concealer in NC 20 this just makes my brows look more crisp and sharp after my brows I'm going to prime my eyes using Urban Decay's anti-aging primer and Mac's soft ochre Paint Pot and I obviously use too much I went cuckoo with that anyways let's start with the eyeshadows I'm using free spirit and I'm blending that all over my eyelids as a base and I'm going to apply the color supermom to my lids this is a beautiful beige matte highlight color I used luscious fresh cleanser to wash my face and I somehow always managed to leave the residue on my hairline so that's what you see there in case if you're wondering next I'm going to apply the color force of nature on my crease and blending it out what I like about this palette is that they have a lot of blending colors in transition colors and this color is perfect for that and I use Coastal Scents 250 brush to apply this and I'm pointing at best friends but I'm actually applying natural beauty right next to it it's a light purple Toby brown shade the names for the shadows are so cute that's another reason why I love this palette I highly recommend this palette it's beautiful love the packaging love the colors in this palette they're old mats pigmented creamy blendable so far I'm really enjoying this palette besides the Mac smiler I only use this palette today but back to a tutorial I'm using two blending brushes to apply the color and blending it out and then I'm taking best friend with next to a seventeen brush and I'm going to darken the crease up even more and I'm going to take it a little bit higher than my crease so I get the Graduate ombre look and I'm going back and forth with same brush not the same brush the Coastal Scents 250 brush and Max 217 brush and I'm going to go in with 441 brush from crown brush to buff everything out these brushes are my homies right now yeah I want to try Sigma brushes but they're kind of expensive so I'm holding off on them for now I'm going to take the darkest shade cold bombshell and that's the darkest purple I love this shade and I'm going to make a soft cut crease look I know I make the most unflattering facial pressures when I apply makeup but I can't help it I'm so weird anyways back to the makeup and I'm doing more blending using Coastal Scents 250 brush so I'm going back with free spirit and applying that to my eyelids and also applying that to my brow bones and there's a plane outside I actually apply a little bit of caregiver and supermom on my lids to make it more pinky hair is better with the purpley shades that I'm using next I'm using the color best friend from the palette and I'm going to apply that to the lower lash line and I'm not going to take the color all the way to my inner inner tear-duct I'm going to flick it downwards keeping the very inner part untouched if that makes sense and I'm going to blend it out and make sure you use a precise brush to do this so you have a clean application I think it's self-explanatory so I'm just going to let you watch the video and to blend out I'm using natural beauty with a bullet brush so it looks soft and smoky now going back with free spirit and I'm going to highlight to the inner part where I didn't touch and by doing this it defines the inner part where we wanted to make it look like it's flicked down and I wanted to make it look more darker on my lower two-thirds of my eyelids or lower lashline so I'm going to apply bombshell with the same brush and I'm going to smoke it out finally I'm going to blend everything out with the Coastal Scents 250 brush and I'm using still as waterproof smudge stick pencil and damsel to waterline my eyelids eyelids lash line waterline what what am I saying I meant waterline and I'm going to use this Japanese version of Kat Von D tattoo liner to make a nice long winged line and then I went over the line with the makeup forever ink liner to make the eyeliners look Matt I went kind of too thick on my other eyes so I used a concealer to correct that cuz I up my eyeshadow so it's all balanced with the long winged eyeliner that I just applied this final touch makes the look all come together I can film this part but I apply a few coats of mascara and I'm moving on to my favorite part lashes I'm using Lena by lashes today and I'm using the left side of the lashes it's called Bianca these were total splurge but they are 50% off they're usually $40 per pair these are my first mink lashes and I'm obsessed these just look so full and beautiful okay next I'm moving on to bronzing my face I'm using Bobbi Brown's brazley powder in natural one and I'm using blush brush by Real Techniques and applying that all over my face perfect bronzing powder loving it next I'm going to contour my face using Anastasia contour kit in color fawn and I'm using the EDA brush and you know the drill beast rub each eked can use some contouring so that's what I'm doing and I also used Havanna on my hollows on my cheeks and I'm going to use bond to contour my nose and this is my new Becca blush hold well honey and I love it it's a beautiful coral bronzy like blush next I'm using miler by Mac this is a like off-white color and I'm applying that to the inner part of the tear duct to just define and intensify the inner part of the eyelids where we kept it blank and let's make some goofy faces okay moving on to my lips I'm using Jordana's rock and Rose lip liner I use this so much Jim in my videos I will switch it up once in a while and do some bold colors and I used a velvet teddy from Mac and on top of that I mixed a myth from Neff to love these combination like I cannot get over how beautiful this myth look on top of anything so loving it and I'm almost out so I bought a new one okay so this is the final look hope you guys like it and I'm sorry I was going pretty fast but it's not a real tutorial it's more like I'll get ready
