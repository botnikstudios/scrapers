hi everyone welcome back to daily mix today we're going back to basics tons of you have requested to know how to use makeup brushes we are going to run you through the best ones and what they do okay guys so I'm going to kick us off with foundation brushes there are so many to choose from and people like which one do I need everyone does a little bit of a different job I'm going to start off with this one which is a buffing brush now a buffing brush is beautiful with most foundations pretty much all foundations and it will really buff a product into the skin so it will give you a very airbrushed finish it's not too much coverage as well but you can build with this brush next I'm going to introduce you to the stippling brush the stippling brush will give you a much lighter coverage it is great if you use a foundation that has light reflecting pigments in because the more you buff it into the skin the more it shows them it's also duo-fiber so it picks up the product here and then as you buff it into the skin the black hairs buff it in a little bit more so they make it more airbrushed onto the skin and these ones all cruelty free synthetic brushes lastly the foundation the one that first we first saw when the foundation brushes came on the market is the normal foundation brush a flat foundation brush they come in different sizes and this one will give you a little bit more coverage next let's talk about concealer I've got two here that I really like and I use them in different areas on the face this one is actually an eyeshadow brush it's called a deluxe crease brush and really you use it through the crease of your eye but because it goes into the orbital bone it also goes under so all the way around so I use this as a concealer brush just underneath the eyes and it fits perfectly this one is a Trish McEvoy brush and I use this when I need more coverage somewhere so say I have red cheeks and I want to put a bit of concealer there I'll use this or just on the forehead or on the chin little bit like a mini foundation exactly yeah I love that one then if you have a tiny blemish to cover then you might want something like this this one is a detailer brush it's a tiny little brush that you can also use in other places on the face I often use it as a lip brush I also use it for blending eyeshadow just along the lash line but it's brilliant for concealer because you can see it's just tapered there so if you have a little blemish you wanna cover that's the one to go for okay so here two of my favorite eyeshadow brushes this is the two one seven for Mac 239 from Mac I use them in every single video they're absolutely brilliant this one I use for packing on products so when I want a dark smoky eye I'm going to use this brush to push it on is short shorter than this one so it's going to pick up a lot more product it's also going to drop a less a lot less product than this one so put it on with this one blend with this one this one you can see it's more splayed out it's longer its fluffier it's gonna blend really well then you have eyeshadow brushes it's slightly more precise it's slightly smaller you've got this is a Mac two one nine and it's basically I love it for getting right under the eyes and buffing in eyeshadow also if you want a little bit of highlighter just in the corner of the eye also use this through my brow bone if I want to conceal really nice brush you have an angle brush now I use this for my eyebrows so I can get a really nice precise shape for my brows also use it for liner so those of you that aren't amazing at doing eyeliner this is a great brush for you because you can use it to guide where you want your eye liner to start so from the lower from your what's this called what did i from your waterline going crazy you can use it from your waterline to plot out where you want your eyeliner to start and then drag it and you can even do pushing motions if you not that comfortable with it I suppose for those that are a little bit more confident with their liner and you've got these kind of fine eyeliner brushes so these you would use in one sweeping motion across the lid next we have a powder brush now we want to powder our foundation into place to make sure that it's going to stay all day there's a few different types of powder brush you can choose from I've got a multitask brush it's not too big I don't want a powder brush that is massive so I'll just buff this all over the face and it'll give me a nice even coverage of powder loose or pressed you've then got an a duo fiber face brush this one's lovely as well because it picks up much less product so if you just want a minimal amount of powered-up just where you shine use this one just over those T's in areas work perfectly you can also use the brush that's slightly smaller this one is actually the contour brush and I like it for getting right into the areas that you just want to powder under the eyes even popping a coat of powder over your eyelids as well so that's perfect I think you have to think about the order that you do your makeup in some people like to put their foundation on and then they like to set their foundation there and then if you are one of those people then you're going to want quite a big powder brush if you're the kind of person like me that does your foundation then your entire makeup then finishes with powder then you're going to want a smaller brush that you can work around the areas so you're not messing up the work you've done okay guys so now you know how to use your brushes let us tell you how to clean them once you have used them because it's really important to clean them how often to clean your brushes have my personal brushes oh probably once a week yeah and the same well actually I clean them every time I change my makeup look so it depends what I'm doing but I think once a week is fine sometimes I don't even do it that often sometimes it I'll leave it like twelve days or something before doing it and really important when cleaning your brushes get yourself a good brush clean that there's loads available now some have oil in as well so this one doesn't actually some have oil in as well so it takes longer for your brushes to clean afterwards so do be careful which ones you get you go for but the oil is great if you want to rule that are a clean some people use just neat alcohol I'm not a massive fan of that because I actually think that over time it dries the bristles out and then the bristles on your brushes break so I wouldn't recommend that so the quickest easiest way to clean your brushes is to spot clean them that's when you take a little bit of your brush cleaner and you pour it on to a cloth then you're going to take your brush and you are just going to move it in circular motions around on the cloth now I actually really favored this method because it does mean that the ferrule never gets wet which means your brushes are going to last and last and last so once you have cleaned your brushes last thing you want to do is to stand it upright because all the brush cleaner that's in there is going to sink through and it's going to wear away the glue that holds all the brush together so make sure you lay it down and another thing that you can do especially if your makeup art is a great thing that we tend to do is once every few months because our brush is a massive massive clean maybe once a month actually and I tend to use a really soft baby shampoo and what do you use generally is very liquid you want something that's antibacterial that's the key ingredient there and give them a real deep clean and then leave them to stand as long as you don't need them for the next few days because they will stay wet for a while again make sure you're not wetting this bit okay people always do that don't they when they do a deep clean they put it in a big bowl of water and it goes you know water all the way up there you only really want to do the bristles yeah and that's really clean obviously makeup artist if you use your brushes on anyone they have to be clean straight afterwards before you use them on anyone else so I hope you found that interesting and maybe you've picked up some new ways of using your brushes if you have different ways that you use your brushes as well that we haven't mentioned pop them in the
