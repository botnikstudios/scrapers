hey guys today's makeup look is a very simple look that I personally like to wear whenever I'm wearing a very bold lip because it really makes the lip color stand out and today I'm going to show you with brown lips which I personally have been loving lately so if you guys want to know how to get this really simple look then please keep watching after the awkward posing brought to you by yours truly thank you I hate posing so freakin much so I'm starting off with nothing on my skin I am using my L'Oreal infallible Pro matte foundation and I'm in thick coloured caramel beige I like to apply this with either a brush or my fingers and then I take my damp sponge with two drops of my purse all eight rolls elixir and I really belong this out onto my skin as you guys know who've been watching my past few videos you guys probably sick of this routine but I love it I really suggest you guys try it out it is amazing for my concealer today I'm using this one from Marc Jacobs to be honest I don't really recommend this concealer please don't waste your money on it like I did because it will crease on you and it will crease bad I had to learn the hard way I wore this concealer a couple times and then by the end of the night I was like why do I look like a melted candle what is going on under my eye and then I realized that it was this concealer which made me really sad because I love everything else in the Marc Jacobs Beauty line all the products are such high-quality I talk about them all the time but this one just really missed the mark for my contour today I'm using the Tom Ford shade and illuminate which is a life holy grail for me I love this I will continue the purchases for the rest of my life and I'm just using the same brush that I applied my concealer with because I'm lazy like that I just wiped it off on a paper towel and then went through with the contour oh hey creepy contoured face so now I'm just going to blend out my contour first I'm using this brush from zoeva which is my favorite contour blending brush ever it blends it out so seamlessly and I feel like it's like the perfect thickness the perfect density the perfect everything so I just blending out the contour first I personally probably would not contour and highlight at the same time again I just wanted to try something different and it's not a method that I enjoy I like to do one thing at a time I my food like that too like I eat one thing at a time and I don't know why that's relevant to this tutorial but yeah the more you know about me I guess so now I'm just blending out the highlighter with my damp sponge and by highlighter I mean my concealer now I'm just going to go through and set that concealer in place I'm using my Marc Jacobs insta mark light filtering powder and I'm using the yellowish shade just to set the centers of my face and my under eye and I'm going pretty heavy with setting this concealer in place because like I said earlier it does crease on you heart break emoji here so now I'm just going to go through and bronze my face I'm using the chocolate Soleil bronzer from Too Faced and this is indie color milk chocolate I think I'll have it in the description box below I got this as a point part from so forums been lasting forever and then for my blush today I'm using this one from Mac I think it's called sweet as cocoa but again I'll have the name in the description box below for my highlighter today I'm using one of my favorites ever and this is by Becca and this is called opal and this is a really nice pinky it's not only pink it's like a champagne color but it has less golden and in which I personally like whenever I'm wearing a really deep lip color and I just like this with brown lips in general so really going ham on the globe because I love me some glow now I'm moving on to the eyebrows look at that highlighter MA - my favorite filling in my eyebrows with my own associate Brahmas indeed color evany and I'm just filling in my brows how I normally fill in my eyebrows I was not having a good bra day this day as you can tell huh kept messing them up and then I'm going to set them in place with by anastasiya clear brow gel for my eyes today I'm just going to blend out whatever concealer may be on my lid and I'm taking this color from my Kat Von D shade and light palette love this palette it's a definite must-have and I'm just applying a wash of this all over my entire lid this is just going to neutralize the lid it has the slightest shimmer it's not really a shimmer it's a satin finish I shadow I love the way this eye shadow looks I wear this eye shadow all the time and I said eyeshadow like eight million times now I'm grabbing the matte black on my favorite angled brush ever this is the 263 from Mac and I'm lining my lash line with this and flicking it up and smoking it out and I'm creating a very elongated wing with this this is my favorite eyeliner look to where I feel like it's so flattering for everybody and it's it's foolproof you cannot mess this eyeliner up and if you do it's okay because it's just shadow and you can just wipe it right away as opposed to like a gel liner a liquid liner so try this out and love it and I love the Kat Von D eye shadow because it's so black and so pigmented so I just like to build up that color and smoke it out now I'm taking my NARS via veneto eyeliner this is just a black and I'm applying this to my tight line this is just to thicken up the lash line and make my lashes look thicker and darker and who doesn't like nice dark lashes for my mascara today I'm using a new favorite which is the Marc Jacobs velvet noir mascara I've been using a lot of Marc Jacobs in this video Marc Jacobs I've just been loving the last little while all of the makeup from their line this mascara is beautiful but it does flake a little which I don't like for the price but I mean I love the way it makes my lashes look so I'm okay with a little bit of flaking I'm also applying this on my lower lashes to open up the eyes and I'm not putting anything on my lower lash line because I really want the focus of this look to be that beautiful cat winged the glowing skin and that chocolate brown lip for my lip color today I'm using the Kylie lip kit in the color true Brown Kay I'm using the liquid lipstick first and then I'm going through with the lip liner that comes in the kit to fix my lip shape so just a little side note these lip kits were not sent to me I paid for them with my very own money and they sold out so quick I'm surprised I was even able to get them but my honest review of these I was not expecting them to be as good as they are I was so pleasantly surprised when I tried them on i was like whoa this is probably the most comfortable high quality liquid lipstick i have ever worn it doesn't even feel drying or anything like that it is so comfortable i love them they are sold out so i will have similar colors for you in the description box below i got you covered so there is the entire lip done I really hope you guys enjoyed this video please don't forget to give it a great big thumbs up if you did subscribe if you want to see some more of me and some more of my awkward posing believe it or not I am so camera shy if somebody's taking a picture of me my lip will go from zero to twitch real quick I'm just the most Awkward human being of life you guys so much for watching and supporting the weirdness that is me I'll see you in my next one hi you
