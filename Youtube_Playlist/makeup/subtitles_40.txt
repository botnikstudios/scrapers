like I'm rude hey guys so in today's video I'm going to teach you all how to achieve this makeup look it's inspired by Instagram pages that post pictures of like baddies and I'm not calling myself a baddie in any way I mean I just copy their makeup a lot of you guys have requested this tutorial because I wear this makeup look in countless videos so if you want to see how I've created and slick and then continue watching so this tutorial I'm going to do like talk-through style I feel like it gives like a better description on how to actually do the makeup so I have nothing on my face right now I just like tea tree water which is like toner don't leave a comment about like what the heck she looks so different without makeup let's just go on with the look because that's what you guys came here to see I always start out with my eyebrows just because I like to clean them up with concealer and it doesn't like get in the way of the rest of my makeup I'm going to zoom you guys in you just want to comb out your brows and you want to do so with a spoolie and you want to take your pomade which is by anastacio and your angled eyebrow brush and I always start to like the middle to tailor my brows it's gonna look super harsh if you start out at the beginning and we do not want that we've filled in pretty much the whole entire brow and now you just want to kind of sparsely feel in the front not a ton and now that your eyebrows like fill in you just want to take your favorite concealer at once the Mac one and you just want to clean it up a bit around your eyebrows so one like the bottom and then kind of how long you guys are always asking for like an everyday eyebrow tutorial this is pretty much what I do this eyebrow it's like just basic eyebrow and then this one I feel like the meme of like Raven Symone right now which is like a bald eagle if I finish this eyebrow I just send you guys out because next we're going to be working on our face I'm using a Mac Foundation and it's almost out so I'm using this to apply it and then I'm just going to blend it out with a Beauty Blender either your new foundation like you guys need to recommend me some I don't really invest in it often because I don't wear on an everyday basis drag the foundation down your neck you want to blend it you know going in with concealer you just want to pile it all underneath your eye okay this will do for now because I am going to go in with a second layer of concealer after I do my eye makeup because I like to fix up my bottom lash line a little bit with the concealer and kind of brighten everything up but yeah this is like a basic base makeup so yeah what you're going to apply a p-- and we are going to go in with the Too Faced chocolate bar palette because it does have a lot of brown matte shades and that's basically what you're going to use in with the shade mocha you can use bronzer like I said nothing is holding you back here this is going to be one of your main crease colors but it's also a transition so make sure you blend this out a time I just want the edges to be really blended out and kind of seamless and I'm using a Mac 224 brush I use pretty much all Mac and Sigma brushes because they're so soft and they blend really well next I'm going in with the shade Bordeaux and applying this in my crease this is going to be my main crease shade you have to lid options you can either use a gold because I finally use that a lot or you can stick to a matte Brown which is what I'm going to use and this is just mocha once again which is my transition shade I didn't like to go in with a watt Tyler like right here then all of the times I will plot Watts my inner corner but I go back in with my hot water oh that's your finish shadow look other than the lower lash line will go in with a felt tip eyeliner right now and it just make a winged want to do a really long wing so and it's pretty easy for me right now I'm talking about doing my wing this is probably not the best you can take off the tape and it will look like this a really clean and I'm going to line my waterline right here for the picture say a lot of the girls line their waterline and I think it looks good compared with the rest of it I look it kind of balances it out on the lower lash line to match the top so I'm going to go in with a Maybelline Joe honor you then want to go in with your transition shade and use that on your lower lash line this is important because you want to even out the top and the bottom for the sake of this look falsies are a must so I'm going to go off-camera and apply the falsies and I'll see you guys after I do so so I applied falsies I blended in with mine when I lashes mascara and applied mascara on my lower lash line and I did the same thing to the side now it is time to go in with powders and kind of highlight and contour work your magic taking a pretty dense powder brush I'm just going to apply a highlight shade I'm using the Anastasio contour kit I love this I don't really set my foundation with any powder I just use like highlight and contour it once you have that you're going to go in with bronzer I'm going to use like the middle shade from the Anastasia contour kit and just really define my cheekbones because that's important to me especially where I'm so pale I go in and I blend all this out and then I go in again and make the line so this is me just applying it so I can blend it out a ton and get kind of a bronzey effect and also closets to my temples don't want forehead brows really small foreheads I don't really need it also make sure you get your jawline and done your neck with the bronzer my hair looks so weird now that how all this makeup on you want to blend this out heavy like you do not want lon and as you can tell like these areas in my face just stand out a lot more in my cheeks look a lot more defined and that's just basically the goal of contouring and highlighting is to make areas of your face stand out and others look smaller I'm going to go in with that same angled brush and I'm just going to go in with hoola bronzer and apply this as an actual contour and I'm not going to blend this out of ten I'm gonna blend it out a little bit but it's not ten because I do want that kind of define sharp contour line and I'm also going to go underneath my mouth I'm taking a Mac blush brush a one-dollar blush I'm literally it's like a coral shade to make my face have a more angular shape so I'm not applying it to the apples just kind of in an upward motion with the stippling brush okay the next step is the best it's the biggest step of the whole entire look it is hot lighting I'm getting a little bit close here because I want to show you guys a whole lot but first I'm using a cream highlighter and normally I won't do this unless it's very special so not applying a ton of it just seem to kind of use as a base you can blend this out using your hands or Beauty Blender I'm just going to use the opposite into the beauty blender that I don't tend to use a ton yes Queen oh my god taking a small dense powder brush and my Becca highlighter this is my Holy Grail highlighter if it's any representation of how much a whole lot I get paid on this in less than a month highlighting is my everything at the moment so I'm just going to enjoy this trend on my ring finger I'm just going to go in and haul out my nose and you don't want to make your nose look oily it's just gonna look like a lot you don't really have to pour your nose if you do this step check this hollowed out you're finished with everything except for the lips so let's move on to that I'm going in with the Kylie lip kit liner and just over lining my lips a little bit not too much though next I'm going in with the actual Dolce K and I'm just using this feeling all the areas that I get into with the lip liner and yeah it's really beautiful after this goes mad I'm going to go over it with a brave up my Mac this is the longest makeup tutorial ever I feel like my pores are about to scream like free us because this is so much makeup but it looks good though it looks good okay so no but it looked like a different person than before I have to do something with this hair and I recommend if you're going for like the bad you look to just straighten it and wait like naki hat or something or just leave it down like you can part in the middle put it behind your ears let's go do something with this hair and I will come back and show you guys the finished look peace and some games but you already in this like a horse on the carousel Oh
