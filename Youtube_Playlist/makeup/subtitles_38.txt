of a little glam you guys can take some things and take away some things I just wanted to give you guys a couple of options and things that you guys can do to just look you know awake and ready for school so I just want to get into this video I hope that you guys like this video please tell me if you guys want to see some more things I'm gonna be actually posting some videos of you know how to's and some people that are very very new to makeup I know I haven't done any videos like that so I definitely want to put out some videos for people that were just getting beginning on makeup and some people that are you know kind of a little bit more skilled so yes let's just get right into this video yeah so I am starting out with my Pierre minerals primer and it's our foreign one illuminating primer and just getting priming my face with that and then I'm going to take my infallible and cover effects foundations and mix them together to cover up my skin right now I am breaking out like crazy I don't know why I think it's my hormones when I get my period TMI but when I got a period it just goes crazy my face just wants to have like a party of zits on it so annoying but anyway I'm gonna take that and blend it all together then use my cover FX concealer palette and I'm using the lightest shade in that palette to highlight under my eyes I am also doing a collab with one of my good friends Nicole Marie Lyon and I will put her YouTube channel down in the description box below she is also doing a back to school makeup look as well so definitely check her out she has great great tutorials great YouTube videos and I think you guys would really like her so definitely check her out in the description below so I'm going to take my NYX high definition setting powder I mean finishing powder sorry and set my highlight with that and I'm using a Beauty Blender to set that as well and I finally got a Beauty Blender I love it so much it just works amazing I'm using the NYX control-freak clear brow gel and just going over my brows to get them in shape I need to then go over them with my Beauty bakery dip brownie dip I can't even remember oh my gosh yeah and go ahead and shape my brows with that highlighting contour palette from cover FX using that lightest color and just pulling under my brows to just give them a little bit more shape and look at them make them look more clean and nice and neat so I'm gonna take my NYX highlight and contour palette meets a brown color to contour my face and just add a little bit more definition and not using too much just a little bit just to bring some more this step is totally optional you don't have to do it I know some people don't wanna look too made-up but I like this step it just brings more like to the face I'm gonna use this cover FX illuminating powder and just go over my highlight and contour all over my face I know some of these products are a little bit more pricey you can definitely use low end products to still get the same look it's not very hard but yeah I just wanted to bring more warmth to my face because I got a little tan and it just will match all over my body reaching back into my NYX palette I'm taking the same color that I use my contour with and I'm going to put that in my crease and creating a little bit of a cat eye but not really so much and then I'm going to use my gosh forgetting words forgetting things uh I'm using my forever 21 palette that color I just showed you and I'm putting it on my lid so I'll be taking my Ultra pearl mania from NYX as well and using that as my highlight and as you guys can see it just oh my gosh it just makes the whole look come together and just brings more life to your face girl just makes you glow yes I love it so much and I'm taking a blush from firm 21 it is a peach color I think it looks like 4 bucks and just put it on my cheeks and then going ahead and blending those about blending that together with my fan brush so now I'm just going to set all of that with my mac's fix+ I'm not finished yet though I'm going to use this mascara from wet and wild and put it on my lower lashes and my top lashes you guys can stop some of you if you want you can stop at this step and not add lashes or you can add lashes which I will be doing at the end of this video adding some lashes because I have small lashes I don't have long lashes and I like the way it looks with the long lashes but you can keep it like this if you'd like to so like I said before I was going to be adding lashes these letters are from kiss and I will put that down in the description below I'm taking this Ruby kisses lip liner and this is my go-to lip I pretty much wear this all the time I just love the way it looks on my skin and it looks more you know natural but I'm gonna line my lips with this and then take my can't think right now I'm going to take my NYX cream lip cream matte lip stain and the color Stockham and go over my lip liner with that and that is the final step to this look I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to leave me a like or a comment if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them and I will be back
