okay so to start off with I'm going to be moisturizing my face and then the one that I have been loving it's kind of expensive for this little jar but this is the Clinique Moisture Surge intense and then this stuff is so bomb I've been using this for like I don't know like I got a little tester from Sephora and I fell in love and I was like dude this is so bomb so even if you're oily I always suggest to moisturize your face because it just it makes your foundation look that much more nice and unlike not so much a dewy but just so much more fresh and healthy looking all right so now that you're all moisturized you kind of want to let that sit in what I do and then I go ahead and put on my primer the one that I keep using it's really inexpensive and it's so so balm is the Rimmel stay matte primer and it looks like this and this one is um I think it's like less than ten dollars and you can get this at Ulta so also if you buy like over ten dollars out Ulta you can use like a 350 coupon and then you save three dollars and fifty cents so then now I'm just putting on the primer and this is really really good I feel like I do stay pretty mad but it's not like super matte or like I start to like look dry and flaky I don't know if you guys can hear it this song has been my shit it's on it's called Kanye by the chainsmokers so bomb and for my pores because I feel like my pores are like super visible I like to use the Porefessional primer from benefit and I got this one this is like a little travel size I think and it's actually really really really good and it lasts for like a really long time this one I usually just put on my t-zone on my nose and rub it in and I also really like this one because it doesn't feel as drying because I have the Smashbox one the purple one this one is for your pores as well to just minimize them and I feel like that one's a little drying so I really like this one because this one I feel like it gives me a bit of moisture as well you guys already know my favorite foundation this one a lot of people ask me what color I'm in I put that shit in the description box guys like no pens but check that shit and I am in the shade 106 Sun beige and I think this is like my second tube I've gone through so I like to put this one on as well as um the Maybelline fit me foundation and then this one looks like that this is the dewy one I think yeah because the other one's a matte and poreless this one is in the shade 230 just in case anyone's wondering because I feel like this one is really really mad and I don't want to look so mad anymore I kind of got over that I kind of want to have like a luminous look to my skin there was this person who made me laugh so bad they commented on that one makeup video I think says something about my ears how like I like the video was cool or whatever but like when they looked at my ears like they cringed and I was I don't know it's just funny I think that word is hella funny I already damped dampen my um Beauty blender or makeup sponge whatever the fuck is called oh my god I need to stop cussing - I really don't like it anymore like I've been obsessed with saying like bad words lately I think it's like really fun it like really brings out my emotion and I can be like fuck or like dig but yeah this is the real techniques like everyone knows what this one looks like and I actually really like this one it does when you let it dry um it does kind of like start crumbling off little pieces I don't know why it does that and um oh I like this song and then um I noticed that when I want to like wash it - use it again the next day it's just that's the only con that I have about it but it's really really bomb and I people what am i work like I suggest it and like I'm just like sorry like I really like to tell people like very like really really bomb makeup products that are inexpensive and I feel a little bad because like the sales and stuff at work but like dude is like I want you guys to save money I want you guys to have bomb shit still look fleek but save your money like who doesn't want that now you look like ass fuck with your flawless s skin I'm going to be using the Mac Pro Longwear concealer I usually use the Maybelline one which is so BAE like this one is I don't know I love finding inexpensive products that are really bomb and I'm gonna take that same makeup sponge I want to cut it call it a Beauty Blender but I feel like some people like really take that up the ass and they're like the little beauty blender because I know that they're like 30 bucks or some bullshit like that this one works just fine big I'm gonna just blend it out look hella crazy and then um I think I also showed that I like semi baked in that one makeup video so I'm gonna go ahead and do that a gun I always do it because I realized that when I bake under my eyes it just it helps my under-eye area not to crease at all and then I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows off camera because I already have a tutorial or a video on that if you guys want another one I guess I can do another one since I do have a newer camera and then you guys will like see it more updated more um just better quality you know what I realized that I forgot to do I forgot to bronze my face and I forgot a highlight I was wondering I was like why am i done so early it's like barely he's barely 12:08 to like really I'm almost done with my makeup usually it takes me like two hours no lie so I was like damn like I'm almost done I'm gonna have time to chill before work but no I forgot to put bronzer on and I forgot to put on my highlight what I usually use for bronzer now another very inexpensive the bomb thing um hair it gotta put my hair out of my face double duty it's a wet and dry pressed powder foundation and then this is the old two one it's so bomb um as you can tell like I've hit pan so I mean I'm not lying and then I don't really contour anymore I just feel it's kind of harsh like sometimes I really do but I mainly now I just like Browns my face the reason why I only just bronze is because I sold I don't know like I feel like it just it looks fine like once I stopped contouring like so intensely like I would have liked that straight line down my cheek like I've kind of felt weird but then like I asked my sister I was like dude do I even like that difference she was like no not really like it's just whatever and I was like I don't have to go extra so I was like why not why not just try bronzing and I just I don't know in my opinion I feel like it looks a lot better on my face and then that is kind of funny to say like Oh less fake more natural it's like bitch if you want to be natural just don't wear any makeup but honestly I kind of like I'm kind of like all or nothing you know it's kind of like if you're gonna do your makeup might as well just like beat your face you know like if you want to do like natural just put on mascara and that's it and then maybe like add some gimme brow or something so you can literally look natural but it's kind of funny to me when I see like natural makeup and you see that they put on like pounds of makeup on like I'm not hating but it's kind of like who cares dude like it's makeup like if you want to put on hella fucking makeup why the fuck not I really hate that people say oh she puts on how the makeup design I it's like who cares you know like I don't know if that's kind of I don't know how to explain myself so good but I hope that kind of makes sense like don't call it natural it's fine just say neutral it's like neutral colors you know like I really hope I explained that well and note that the way I kind of say what I want to say is it so clear sometimes like honestly I hate the fact that I like girls feel the need to justify what they do it's just like what the fuck cares you know I don't know like um there is this one guy who commented on my I put a comment on his video cuz he made a stupid oz video about oh how girls are at the gym and I was just like dude this is such a stupid video and the guy isn't even funny and this guy commented back because it was his video obviously you know and he was like I bet you're the type of girl to go to the gym with a full face you know like with hella makeup on and then like I was going to respond and then I was just like like why like why I don't need one I don't know him - do you really think that wearing a fuck ton of makeup to the gym is gonna make me work out like less how do I say it's gonna it's not going to make me work out less than I'm capable of working out like when I go to the gym with a full face of makeup on I fucking go hard when I go with there's some stuff on I still go as hard and then when I go with just maybe lashes and brows no liner no nothing I it's all the same it's like why do you feel the need to tell someone oh I bet you're that type of girl it's like do you like I'm probably going harder than you at the gym the fuck I don't mean to sound like a bitch or whatever but less shit like pisses me off so much you know it's just like you really think putting makeup on my face isn't gonna like I'm still gonna train hard you know whatever okay so for highlight I'm gonna be using this one from Mac this one's my favorite like when I got it I was like dude should I get it should I know I took me like a good ten minutes to decide to actually buy it and then this one is global glow and I'm just gonna put a lot of it not gonna lie on my cheekbones I literally have like the mirror like right in front of me I've never done my makeup like this so um let me know if this is okay like I know that my background is not so cute um but yeah if you guys don't mind these type of videos just I mean tell me I guess in the comments like oh these are cool like it's fun watching I guess I'm gonna go in with the tinted brow mascara um by NYX another inexpensive product see I'm not lying like these products are so bond and then I just go over that um I go over it lightly what the fuck am I saying see I you guys I can't talk I'm not going to cut that out because this is real life stuff like I noticed that I stopped breathing to to do my brows like I literally hold my breath and then like I don't know where like I'm just like and then like I just started laughing I was like damn even for my brows dude do it for the brows cool so now we're done with their face I got a little bit closer just so you guys can see what I'm doing I have this like little mini Urban Decay primer potion that I got as a sample oh my god I didn't even finish telling you guys about the gem thing like it just really pisses me off if you're a guy and you're watching this um and you like judge girls for that shit just like rethink what you say you know it's like really stupid when guys or even girls like they judge people for worrying makeup it's like you don't know if they just got off of work do like what if they feel like hella insecure without their makeup and you're over there making them feel bad you know it's like everyone has their own shit you know you guys really have to like watch what you guys say not to me cuz I feel like I don't get a lot of like hate comments like a lot of people are nice and I'm really really grateful for that but you guys just like may not like you exactly like I'm not directing it to you but I'm just saying like like everyone even myself like I have to think about shit that I say we have to all think about it because you don't know if they've like they've had the last straw in that day and like it what if that one thing that you tell them that just like throws them over the cliff or whatever the same is and they're dead no like you don't know you don't know people's situation I get so like I'm very very passionate about that like just being nice showing people that you care like having a big heart like don't be a bitch I don't know if your guy the judges or a girl also seem to you like just really think about the people you know like would you want someone to say that to your mom would you want someone to say that to your sister would you want someone to say hi to you for my um under the eyebrow I'm gonna be or I'm using this one right here it's so hard to do this I'm not used to doing that it's like a really big pallet and then I'm just using that for under the brow just to kind of set the concealer that I used to like kharbut do these shadows are so buttery like the first time I use them like I'm not used to them being this soft that they kind of like not crumble but they kind of um they're kind of messy and like the first time I use them I was like whoa like they're messy but they're so long so now I'm gonna go in with kind of like a brown it's a warm brown color it's right under the first yellowy one that I used this one right here the reason that you start off with lighter colors is just because it makes it so much easier to blend your eyeshadow and then that's how it looks so bond like if you're doing like a dark like burgundy eye or like a dark brown eye or a dark like black eye or like a dark smoky purple eye so you just start off slowly I know like some people are new and like they um they wonder how like people do it like that but that's how I was - at first like I would just put on like the harsh like just dark color one color cuz I didn't I honestly didn't know like I had to teach myself I had a pretty much just do the whole trial and error and that's like basically how I learned and then now people tell me that they like my makeup but I'm just like I guess thank you I mean I don't want to be like cocking like oh yeah because I honestly don't know if my makeups nice like people might say it's nice but is it really okay now I'm going to be taking the bag 217 brush and then with this one I'm gonna really like put it in my crease I'm gonna take more of a like this color and then maybe that color just to like build up ntencity because I did say I when I do like that like dark smoky Brown I I've also been wanting to dye my hair I've been trying to strip it at home I don't know if you guys can tell like it's kind of like a light gray in person some of it is like a green and it just looks really in my opinion it looks a little bit crazy but um I mean that's what I got for doing it myself right I don't think it looks that bad though but what do you guys think I really want to diet like I don't want to go to like a teal color or I want to I want to go back to purple or I want to do like a lavender but I just I'm so indecisive and sometimes I'm just like dude I should just go back to blah and then I'm just like nah because people tell me they like it and I don't know I feel like the Purple's really me but it's kind of a hassle to maintain it and then since I did dye it myself I feel like it doesn't look as good you know you get my feel so if you guys want to let me know what color I should do next like I'm open to any color like I wanted to do rose gold but um like I'm not sure if my hair is like gonna take it like I got some fucked up bastard so now that we have all of that on I'm gonna take my finger just so it's more in time I'm gonna just put it like um like on the lid because it kind of looks a bit lighter right there I'm going to go ahead and do my under arse and then same thing put it under here and just kind of connect on those two together I'm just packing on on the color and then with every shadow that I add it's good and it's just getting darker cuz I do want this to be very smoky I'm really into glitter so I'm going to go ahead and add some glitter on my inner corners because I don't really like how it looks when it's like that white thing like the white inner corners I think that it looks so funny on me this was like three dollars I think it's super inexpensive it's so bomb it's lasted me like damn I've had this since um I don't know if you guys knew but I used to work out Walmart and I've had it since I worked at Walmart because I bought it there and then what I do is I put my pinky in there and then I just put in my inner corners and I think it looks super bomb I'm gonna go ahead and do my eyeliner and then I'll come back and put on my lashes you guys already know my favorite lashes I'm actually stocked up here let me show you guys just to be a bitch so I have all of these just because I'm not obsessed like I'm I'm not gonna be without them I'm not gonna like run out I was like fuck no I'm gonna have these I'm gonna be stocked up for life every time I see them no matter what like I have one two three four five I have six backups but these are my favorite lashes so anytime I see them like I just grab them like fuck being without these they're so long okay now I have everything on I put all my lashes on my hair is in front now I put on mascara as well because I mean I didn't want you guys to like see me doing like you know like my face like that um so this is the final look it's very like warm very smoky in my opinion um usually I don't do this anymore but I don't know I think I came out nice I've also been thinking to do a Q and a because just so like the new people can get to know me I still want to do my lips I don't know what I'm planning to do I mean I'll probably just go for a neutral lip like always cuz why the fuck not I'm going to take max nice and spicy lipliner you this is the NYX soft matte lip cream in the color London and it's number four and I'm just gonna I hope it looks nice I'm gonna put that all over my lips all right so basically this is the finished love and I want to say thank you guys so much for watching let me know what color I should do my hair let me know if I should do the Q&amp;A and then just let me know what you guys think about like everything that I was saying and if there's any questions I'm going to leave all the products down in the little description box so please check that out and um I'll just see you guys in my next video you guys are awesome thank you so much
