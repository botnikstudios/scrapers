like yes four-month break let's do it let's get into the filming I'm so keen set everything up had my lights up all the makeup was on the table brushes had clean my brushes the night before just so everything was really nice and fancy you know and then I had my camera sitting on my wall like on the tripod ready to like set it up to film and you know how cats like they get in these random bursts of energy and they're like zooming around the house like on the couch is everything there like going crazy and you're like what the heck is going through this cat's mind why do I not have that much energy what are you running from I don't understand what is wrong with my cat that's basically what I was thinking until I was thinking I want to kill this freakin cat because she came into my room running like a crazy cat and my she's like hit my camera like the bottom of the tripod my camera fell over I was just like sitting over from afar like watching in shock like anyway I was sitting here like a complete shock like there was nothing I could do like I just had to sit here and watch as my camera fell and I didn't know what the outcome would be turned out my camera broke it would not turn on I didn't know what's wrong I was like oh my goodness so it took so long to get it fixed to the point where I thought I was gonna have to buy a new camera and I was like oh my god cameras are so expensive I would rather save that money instead of buying a freaking camera but they fixed it so here I am filming and it feels so good to be back so get ready for a heap of videos because I have so many ideas in mine and so many that I'm filming today so keep an eye out watch this space it's going to be great in today's video I have filmed my everyday makeup for you guys so it does seem I don't

I try it so many smoothing primers I have tried the Too Faced one the benefit Porefessional the Smashbox one and this is the best one I feel like this just does the best job of like actually filling your pores and making your skin look like paulus and smooth to pick up a little bit of corrected this is the Bobbi Brown corrector in the shade light peach it's just like a orangie peachy kind of ad which you can't get from the name like peach I guess and I'm just going to apply this to the bags onto my eyes with a 142 concealer buffer brush look at the difference there seriously serious guys

anti fatigue effect in radiant glow concealer it's a very long name Emily okay so this is actually my first time using this normally I would use my NARS radiant creamy concealer and this is in the shared light one Chantilly you and now taking my Laura Mercier translucent powder to set this and this is the best what's we're coming out the best like powder to set under your eyes evolved in the history of ever next for the rest of the face I'm going to be taking my nose Prescott in the shade beach on Miami gloss number one powder brush now I'm taking my hourglass ambient lighting bronzer and it's in the shade luminous bronze and light luminous bronze light and my one to six Lux cheek finish brush from zoeva to contour I'm going to be using my hoola by benefit bronzer on my Mac small

together on a blush brush so now I'm going to go for a bath in some highlighter this is the mary lou manizer hideout up from balm and a morphe m51 brush so now I'm going to get started on my eyes and the first thing I want to do is prime them with a little bit of my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and this is a Real Techniques deluxe crease brush which is pretty much exactly the same as a concealer buffer brush from zoeva but I actually like the real technique one better because it's just like fluffier I just an inner it's fluffy ah it feels better I feel like it blends product out a lot better so on my acid and me use my favorite ever pallor which somehow I managed to make a dent in and now doesn't open the whole way but I literally don't know what I did to it I don't know I just pulled it out of the drawer and I was like this and I was like what the heck happened in the drawer it's like the Toy Story movie my makeup like comes alive beats each other up and then like when I'm in the room and I come and roll they were like laughs loose makeup products again anyway this is like my Holy Grail make up front up makeup palette I love to I wish the true face would make like single

to set the soft ochre and now I'm gonna pick up my Sigma e35 and the shade peanut butter here and I'm just going to apply this into my crease and I apply this in like a rounded shape rather than bringing out and I take it all the way in to the inner corner now I'm going to pick up a pencil brush this is the 231 luxe petit crease brush from zoeva and I'm going to grab the share truffled here

and they are in the style of Bella because I'm going to do is I'm going to line my lips using the Mac lipliner in the shade whirl and it's really funny because like everyone over lines their lips but I feel like my bottom lip is too big for my top lip so I underline it like I make it appear small up because I don't know I don't like to over draw my lips because I feel like it's so obvious so I under draw my bottom and now for my lips I'm gonna app a what now for my lips I'm going to apply the Anasazi Beverly Hills liquid lip gloss in the shade undressed and that brings us to the end of
