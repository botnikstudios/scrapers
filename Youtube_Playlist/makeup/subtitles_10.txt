hi everyone so I'm going to do a everyday tutorial makeup tutorial this is gonna be combat carve get really with me love what I basically do every day and this is like my go-to everyday so I wouldn't do this every single day but it's more like my everyday makeup when I want to be glam or like when I can't think I think I want to do on that day I'll let you just do this because easiest option it's so easy to do if you're wondering why I've got this bandage on my thumb in a tiny little horror story right now so basically I probably explain what happened but basically my thumbnail or my thumb obviously I've got fake nails on my thumbnail got taken off so the acrylic and it tip it took off the my real nail with it so basically I've basically just got raw skin underneath this is quite painful it's actually quite hard to do my makeup so if you know how I got this very simple look then you write on this on white eyebrows this is Mac eyebrow pencil in spite I'm gonna speed this it up just because I've got a full video of like how I do my eyebrows so if you want to know how I do my eyebrows in detail then I'll put a link in the description but I'm going to get money I move now for our brush by real techniques we've used to help I broke it I use about a bit and the elf has now been discontinued but I know that blows of places - like I broke it I know sneak comes with one for a good price but if not then just use a brown eyeshadow that complements your brows okay to conceal my brows I'm going to use my Mac Pro Longwear concealer with this I like to put it on one brow fast so I put it on and then I blend it as soon as I put it on this concealer tends to dry very very quickly and then it goes all orangie and stuff once it's just dried in place and it's just not you so I put it on blend it put on another area blend it you get I blend it with my Real Techniques crease brush deluxe crease brush so I just wear this cuz simple it just come down here I just drag it free middle every light this concealer the only thing I don't like is how much comes out of the pump like loads is on my hand and lows didn't need to be on my hand but there's no work really control okay then I do the cockpit so this probably a better browser never I mean is rare I get both of them or ordinate point then what I do is I get my Urban Decay primer potion well I also have to do is make sure concealer is here so whatever is remain on this brush that I use to blend out on my eyebrows and just put it here because I don't forget to put it there and then I take pictures and then there's like just anyway I'm going to use the find it at my Mac two to four brush today I'm going to use it is it with everything today we compute the post off noise okay today I'm going to use the Too Faced chocolate bar palette then dip it in the color milk chocolate and it's semi-sweet and this will go my quiz they're just going to use a flat eyeshadow brush and go with the color white chocolate which is this one and I'm going to pack this all over the lid vacuum with the two colors that we had before which is my chocolate and it's a sweet and go back in degrees okay that's that fire shadow right then I'm going to use my L'Oreal suite lineup I'm sure they've discontinued this so every time like I see like one like left to the shop and itchy just like fire bit this is my favorite ever I lied I don't know why they would ever just continue like you don't say hearts I am I've also I'm gonna speed this up as well but also those two little penis so that would be linked more so now there's a little bit mascara wrong okay I'll go flashing on these I normally use on a when I put makeup on I don't mean use ardell demi whispies that she's going to be using today I'm very easy as diaper twice so they're not as crushed as one it's me okay so I put my lashes on and I'm going with this drug before anything goes with my eyes then I'm going to start I'm going to put this Mac strobe cream on where I want to blue darling okay so I've been using em the new NARS foundation I love comfort I love it right this is the all day luminous weightless foundation I'm in circles or however you say it but this is what it looks like I really like this foundation it says you'll need one pump to like have a full face coverage but I am a full face junkie even though I don't need it but I love like really full face so I use like two and a half pumps but you could use you could easily get away with one or two using my Real Techniques buffing brush I'm just tapping in at first with this foundation I like it more as the day goes on so M because that does it goes quite it goes on quite matte and I'm not really a Maps fan I like the glue okay so that's foundation on I'm just going to use my Real Techniques spongy pinging and just hi is this a dump it's damp at moment so I'm just going to Pat it just to make sure everything's even and blend it out properly okay I'm then going to use my know I was radiant creamy concealer in caramel and this I don't put it directly like right here because that's too much product and then it will cause too much creasing so like when I'm blending it out I'll just work it up so it's not nodes I'll just put it anywhere else where I feel like I sometimes use my pro longwear as well as the NARS radiant creamy concealer but there just don't need ever telling you concede I always think like completely casinos it's really good okay I'm going to say with my Ben Nye banana powder and I'm going to use some where is it Asylum up max you fix fluid in nw15 this is for contour I know this seems like a lot of products for an everyday look but this is what I like to do and also is I don't actually use a lot or product not what anyways I want to move it so anyway I'm relieved my body shop foundation brush oh this is a blusher brush actually I know it's a foundation brush but and I'm gonna blend it I like my Punto to be quite strong contour strong I like it to be just like quite visible usually it'll be really bit more he's my blendy brush she makes sure everything's blended and undergo my body shop kabuki brush I might use my Mac mineralize skinfinish in deep dark literally use like a little bit this is just to warm up the face slightly you don't want to like to do deep contour with this you just want it to just warm up the face tattoo little bit okay ends to contour properly well to contour over the cream foundation contour contour ready I'm going to use my matte bronzer by Mac use my Real Techniques cheap brush I also have to contour my nose I like to use my Mac - - for I'm doing that I don't do it lowers just slightly we have to know that everyone has to do this okay so now I'm going to use my love's two drops and some rush we've got really watery recently I'm not Reginald boy but anyway I'm just going to put it on oh I put it on on my cheekbones I put on my forehead and a bit on my nose I'm just going to use my same a buffing brush and blend it in this is the same brush I use for my foundation okay then I get my in a mask on highlight I can't see the color it's rub dog up it is what it looks like little bit on a fan brush and we just I just put my Cheetos mainly okay then I'm going to go in with blusher I like to do my highlight before my blood like for like 800 feet just blends in a little bit a little bit more once my highlight is done and then I just blush one you just put those in there I'm going to my L ticking brush with Mac's /i it teaches okay I'm also going to use today my mac eyeliner this is in I'll go alone it's just a nude that put it in my waterline I like to use nude colors rather than white because it's just that little bit more natural and it's not just like BAM I've got white eyeliner on drumming but it still opens your eye I'm going to use a little bit of a star on the bottom eyelashes I never I don't really really up I have been recently this is just a natural collection skaara I don't ever spend money on scars because my Allah she's not long anyway so I feel like nothing makes a difference and then I use whatever color our lipstick I said of the day that could be red because you get hot purple which would just be like any powerful but normally I go for a nude on an everyday basis and today I'm going to use peach stock by Mac as quite is it that is a very nude color looks like that then I use my Mac lip gloss in wildly lush and I use my mac fix+ spray I really go in with the spray by the way like I really like I'll go in and that is what I do every day basically well not every day this is what I do this is like my go-to everyday makeup when I want to feel a bit more glam I hope you guys enjoyed it the next video probably going to do is a hair tutorial maybe I'm actually going on off on a day in ten days so I think I'm going to be doing like a blog video on like my holiday and stuff and so that should be fun but from I'm going to do
