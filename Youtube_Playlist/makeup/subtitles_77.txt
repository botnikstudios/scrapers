hey guys it's Amanda so today I'm going to be showing you a Victoria Secret Fashion Show inspired a hair and makeup so the fashion show just happened for this year the final look it's super glowy and fresh it's also really good everyday makeup look too but I decided to do inspired by the Victoria Secret Fashion Show since it just happened I thought it was beautiful now if her hair I'm working with the new me to show you how to get these big waves I'm using the lustrous set from new Muse holiday catalog and this comes with the lustrum uhm curling iron set so it has all these different barrels and the one that I'm going to use there's the really big one if you have long hair I would recommend using that one for this look but since my hair shorter I'm going to use the one down from that which actually I realized I couldn't use um the big one for this but I decided to do this one I you can use the glove if you want but I decided not to I'm just gonna be a little rebel and I'm just gonna curl away from my head with this you know how it goes and it's okay if the curls are super tight at first because we're going to brush them out and don't worry about it um so this set also comes with this silhouette straightener and argan oil and I have some codes for you guys um because it's the holidays and I know this is a great great gift I talked about it in my last video so um you can get 20% off the entire holiday collection with the code holiday with Amanda and use love Mandy 24 to get any set for $89 and free shipping in the u.s. so I love these new me products they're just amazing and this is basically the only stuff that I use on my hair so I'm just gonna curl all the way around my head um just wrapping around the barrel away from my face and I'm using kind of small sections but you could have used bigger ones because I realized that for the fashion show they actually did a lot more wavy instead of curls this year so they're super tight now I'm just gonna brush them out and them look more wavy not tight curls so you should definitely check out this gift set I'll have a link down below because it's perfect to give for the holidays and there's also a lot of different deals and sets with new me so you can check those ones out too so this is the hair I'm just twisting it when you twist it and then see how I'm doing that it makes it look like bigger thicker waves and that's what we want so here is the hair and I thought the makeup was so awesome and I've been doing my foundation routine a little bit different so and then I'd show you how I do it all in one so I'm starting off with the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation and my Beauty Blender I'm obsessed with the Beauty Blender I don't know what I did without it it just blends so perfectly and gives such a natural look of your foundation while keeping the coverage that you want so it's perfect I'm just dabbing this all over my face and the foundation is really really amazing too I've been loving it um and I'm also going to press it over my eyelids because I don't like to use an extra eye primer I just use Foundation and concealer so I switch between the tart and Anastasia concealer because they're both really the same kind of coverage I think but I just got the Anastacio one and I'm loving it as you can tell like see how great that coverage is it's super brightening it's really easy to apply and it just immediately makes your face look so much more awake and bright so I really like that and I use my new blender too it is perfect it is a Holy Grail product um so the color I'm in in this concealer is the lightest one I think it's point five you know the struggle the struggle so I'm just putting this on my nose on my forehead and my chin underneath my eyes all places that I want to highlight my face because as you can tell it just really brightens it up and makes your face book makes it pop so I really really recommend this concealer I think it's amazing but also the Tarte one is really great too it gives a similar coverage but this one just I just did this one in the Top Pot way then i am using the laura mercier secret brightening powder and again on my Beauty Blender just tapping this underneath my eyes to set the concealer using a translucent and brightening powder will just keep it bright and you won't lose like the coverage you have underneath your eye so I'm just putting that everywhere that I put the concealer and over my eyelids too so I have a good base for my eyeshadows I'm gonna take a face powder on the rest of my face this one's a little bit darker this one's for Marc Jacobs I know I'm using like more higher-end stuff I'm sorry about that that's just like things I ended up using um right now for my foundation routine you can use any one that you want like you definitely don't need to be high-end I'm using a bronzer now and I'm just giving a soft kind of contour ah sometimes I do a really harsh ones but I thought the girls for the show had more of a softer contour it was still dramatic and names still contoured but not like a straight line um and it just like immediately gives that slimmed-down face as you can tell on the other side so I'm just blending blending blending I'm using the Anastasia contour palette and also blend it down your neck so it all matches now I'm contouring my nose and I'm not great at this um it's a work in progress I'm working on it so I don't think I did a very good job but I have to practice to get there I'm just using the same bronzer I used and putting this on my nose I'm trying to figure out what kind of contour works best with the shape of my nose um but yeah just trying to contour that and then I'm gonna blend it out once I have it in the place that I like just with like the big fluffy brush I'm just gonna blend it all out so it's not just straight dark lines on my nose because that would not look right now for the highlight this is a Nastasia two and I'm just applying this to my cheek bone I'm using this tiny roll brush which I think a bigger brush it's a little bit better but this is what I had with me and it still worked so I'm applying this underneath my brow and on my nose I really like a super highlight and knows to I don't know I just think it's cute um putting it on my Cupid's bow on the other side also above my eyebrow I just like to highlight like crazy I love the glowing look and I thought the girls had that too I'm also putting it on my inner corner because I noticed that their makeup was super bright in the inner corner to just like shimmery and natural I'm also putting it on my lower lashline to brighten even more we just really want a bright and glowy look and face it so now I'm just blending everything out because there's a lot of different products on I want it to flow really naturally so I'm just blending blending blending then taking NARS orgasm blush I think this blush matches what they are wearing pretty close they had a lot of blush on so I'm really trying to pack this on to get the same effect and there is the foundation I've loved this routine I've been doing and it's so amazing I'm taking the Urban Decay all nighter spray and setting my face with that just gives the best dewy effect after it makes it look a little bit more natural and not cakey so that's great then I'm taking some eyeshadows to use for my brows I'm using eye shadows because I want it to be a little bit more natural I know that their eyebrows weren't like super defined and perfect so I was trying to do the same thing trying to keep them super natural filling them in on the end and then working in on the inner inner part of my eyebrow and then adding like little hairs as you can see how I'm doing right there with the brush so I couldn't make them very even but I was just trying to keep them as natural as possible not like super defined so you can watch what I'm doing um and as I'm watching it looks like your girl needs to get your eyebrows done I didn't even notice that but this HD camera is really showing me that it's time um so I was filling those in and you got to work with it you know I just wanted to give them natural so that's what I did with that and voila now I'm taking the taupe color from my lorac Pro palette and applying this in my crease I'm not focusing on the outer corner at all I noticed that that's how their crease colors looked so I decided to do the same thing and I'm also applying it on my lower lashline to balance it out and give a little smokiness underneath but still keeping it super natural because this is a pretty light color then I'm taking the lenses from Maybelline of just a pencil eyeliner and I'm going to line my upper lash line because it was more soft it wasn't like a felt tip or the liquid eyeliner that they use and I'm also not going to wing it at all which is what I normally do I'm just putting on a lash line and actually I do try to wing it a tiny bit just a mini mini mini wing like that just to kind of pull out the eyes a little bit more and I'm going to do the same thing on the other eye yes it's only Holi you can't forget curling your eyelashes so I'm just gonna do that I like to kind of pump it a little bit so it gives the best curl then I'm using the Tarte lights camera lashes and mascara and this one's amazing it gives you the kind of false eyelash look without having to apply them so I've been using this one a lot lately and I'm also applying it to my lower lashes just a little bit I'm not going super crazy and then that is the eye look for my lips I'm using pure Hollywood from Anastacio it's a liquid lipstick they had a kind of like peachy pink color so this is what I decided to go with and just because this is new I really wanted to use it that's why I used it and that's the look I'm totally obsessed with it I think it's super natural and pretty um and it just like highlights the best features you know if you trust out make sure to send me a picture and thanks for watching bye guys mmm
