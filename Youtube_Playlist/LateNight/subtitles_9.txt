&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I AM BESIDE MYSELF WITH EXCITEMENT BECAUSE MY NEXT GUEST HAS PLAYED SO MANY ICONIC CHARACTERS, FROM RUDY TO SAMWISE GAMGEE AND MOST RECENTLY PAUL MANAFORT. HE NOW STARS IN "STRANGER THINGS." &gt;&gt; I WAS A LITTLE YOUNGER WITH YOU STANDING IN LINE FOR THE FERRIS WHEEL AT THE COUNTY FAIR. I FEEL A WHITE GLOVE TAP ME ON THE SHOULDER. I SPIN AROUND AND THERE HE IS, "HEY, KIDDO. WOULD YOU LIKE A BALLOON." GO AHEAD, LAUGH. IT WAS FUNNY. IT WASN'T FUNNY BACK THEN, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. I COULDN'T GET HIM OUT OF MY HEAD. EVERY NIGHT, HE WOULD COME TO ME IN MY DREAMS. EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE CAME TO ME, I RAN. &gt;&gt; Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME SEAN ASTIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS ) &gt;&gt; THAT'S AWESOME. &gt;&gt; Stephen: HI! &gt;&gt; HI. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU. &gt;&gt; FINALLY! &gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, WE MET BRIEFLY DURING REHEARSAL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE YOU WALKED OUT ON STAGE-- DO WE HAVE THIS? I WAS IN THE MIDDLE-- &gt;&gt; I HATE THOSE EMBARRASSING -- &gt;&gt; Stephen: I WAS JUST TRYING TO REHEARSE SOME OF THE MATERIAL, AND AS I WAS TRYING TO REHEARSE IT, YOU WALKED OUT JUST TO SAY HI IN YOUR UNDERWEAR. AND-- HEY! I GOTTA TELL YOU-- I GOTTA TELL YOU, FOR ME, IT'S LIKE I'M THE CHEERLEADER MEETING THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM BECAUSE-- I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY TIRED OF THRG. BUT YOU WERE IN THIS MOVIE CALLED "LORD OF THE RINGS. OF. &gt;&gt; I WAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). &gt;&gt; Stephen: HAVE YOU HEARD ME TALK BUIN THAT? YOU ARE MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN MY FAVORITE MOVIE. I AM-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT-- HOW TO DESCRIBE HOW EXCITED I AM TO MEET YOU RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY-- FIRST OF ALL, THE REASON I DID THAT, COME OUT TO SEE YOU LIKE, THAT MY 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ELIZABETH, BEGGED ME NOT TO DO ANYTHING TO EMBARRASS THE FAMILY. ( LAUGHTER ). &gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD DAD. &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH, I LOVE YOU. NOW WE'LL WEIL GET BACK TO THE NORMAL PART. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT "LORD OF THE RINGS" THAN ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE "LORD OF THE RINGS" COMBINED GLI FOUND OUT-- AND IT ONLY SLIGHTLY BROKE MY HEART, THAT YOU-- WHEN YOU GOT THE PART, YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT "LORD OF THE RINGS." &gt;&gt; MY DEGREE FROM U.C.L.A., IS IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN HISTORY-- OR HISTORY IN AMERICAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY. &gt;&gt; IT'S A BRITISH-- IT'S AN ENGLISH STORY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, IT IS. &gt;&gt; U.C.L.A., THEY'RE GOING TO BE MAD THEY KIND OF-- ACTUALLY, WHEN MY AGENT CALLED ME, SHE SAID, "HONEY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FLAWLESS BRITISH ACCENT BY TUESDAY." THIS IS EYE REAL CONVERSATION. AND I SAID OKAY. SHE SAID "PIERCE JACKSON IS DOING THE 'LORLD OF THE RINGS TRIOLOGY '" FOR NEW LINE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE "LORD OF THE RINGS" PART WAS. SHE SAID IT'S THE SEQUEL TO THE HOBBIT, THE HOBBIT. HONESTLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE "PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH. GLVMENT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. &gt;&gt; TOTALLY DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: AT ANY POINT DID YOU READ THE BOOKS? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD. &gt;&gt; I-- I-- THERE WERE SOME THAT DIDN'T. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SOME ON THE-- IN THE CAST? &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO DIDN'T READ THEM. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; BUT I READ THEM COVER TO COVER THREE TIMES, AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM. TO ME, IT WASN'T LIKE BEING TRANSPORTED INTO ANOTHER WORLD. IT WAS LIKE WORK, YOU KNOW. IT WAS LIKE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW WOULD HE HOLD THE PIPE? YOU KNOW, HOW WOULD -- &gt;&gt; Stephen: RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HOW WOULD-- ALL THE LITTLE-- THE LITTLE YOU IN GLANSZ THEY CHANGED A FEW THINGS ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; OKAY, GO ON. AND I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU BY THE WAY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I'D LOVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS, BE A GUEST ON MY OWN SHOW. &gt;&gt; SORRY. ( LAUGHTER ). &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER, YOUR VERSION OF SAM, YOU CALL HIM MISTER FROADO, IN THE SCRIPT HE WAS MASTER. &gt;&gt; I THINK I SAY MASTER SOMETIMES. THEY'RE LONG, YOU CAN'T WATCH ALL THE THEM AT ONCE -- &gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, YOU CAN. YOU CAN WATCH ALL OF THEM AT ONCE. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE PANTS ON. ( LAUGHTER ). &gt;&gt; APPARENTLY, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME. &gt;&gt; Stephen: EXACTLY. ARE YOU YOUR OWN FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM "LORD OF THE RINGS." SAM IS THE HERO, TOLKIEN HIMSELF SAID SAM IS THE HERO OF "LORD OF THE RINGS." &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT SAM WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WANT TO BE CONSIDERED HERO OF THAT STORY SO MY OFFICIAL, ON-THE-RECORD ANSWER IS NO. I HAVE TWO FAVORITE CHARACTERS. GOLUM, THE STINKER, EVEN THOUGH HE KEEPS CALLING ME STUPID, FAT HOBBIT, IT'S ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING CHARACTERS. AND TREE BEARD. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SURE, YEAH. &gt;&gt; I LOVE TREE BEARD. AND SOOTS SO KIND OF-- I GUESS IT'S SORT OF TYPICAL AND POLITICAL WHATEVER. DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, WHEN YOU GO ACROSS ENGLAND, THE SMOKESTACKS BELCHING, AND PEOPLE WERE HAVING LUNG PROBLEMS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, AND TOLKIEN WROTE THIS STORY, AND IN THE STORY HE CREATES THESE TREES, THESE SLOW, LUMBERING, THINKING, TALKING TREES THAT WERE JUST LIKE MY DAD-- REMEMBER JOHN AFTIN, GOMEZ. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YES. &gt;&gt; HE'S AN IMP. AND THAT'S IT, I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT, MY DAD IS TREE BEARD. AND THEY COME TO LIFE AND FIGHT TO DEFEND -- &gt;&gt; Stephen: THE FOREST. &gt;&gt; THE FOREST AND, YEAH, AND ACCIDENT SCENEY AND STUFF. SO I JUST LOVE THE IDEA OF, LIKE, WHETHER OR NOT MAN WANTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PART IN WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT, THE ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T CARE. IT'S GOING TO COME-- IT'S GOING TO RISE UP AND PROTECT ITSELF. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I HOPE SO. ( APPLAUSE ) I HOPE SO. &gt;&gt; IT WILL. &gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW, YOU'RE ON "STRANGER THINGS." &gt;&gt; YEAH, "STRANGER THINGS." &gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW YOU'RE ON "STRANGER THINGS," SECOND SEASON. IT'S SET IN THE 80s. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE ONE OF THE STARS OF THE GOONIES, AND OTHER THINGS LIKE ""E" "T"" ARE BIG INFLUENCES ON THIS SHOW. WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS REALLY FAMILIAR TO ME? &gt;&gt; YES, IT'S A LITTLE BIT-- WHAT'S SO COOL IS THE DUFFER BROTHERS WHO CREATED IT, THEY'RE SO SWEET AND SUCH BEAUTIFUL GUYS. AND YOU'RE STANDING THERE AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT, LIKE, A RADIO SHACK OR, YOU KNOW, A GREMLIN CAR OR ALL THESE KIND OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE-- AND THEIR IDEA, IT'S LIKE THEY'RE UNPACKING ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND OR SOMETHING. THIS GREAT DISCOVERY. THEY HAVE, LIKE, HISTORICAL ADVISERS ON THE SET TO TALK ABOUT WHAT POSTERS WOULD BE RIGHT TO GO ON THE SET. SO TO ME, LIKE, THE 80s IS-- WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD YOU ARE, BUT TO ME THE 80s IS-- HE'S KIND OF TIMEs, RIGHT? LIKE, YOU CAN'T EVEN-- ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS ) YOU ARE. YOU ARE. ANYHOW, IT IS-- YES, IT IS A WONDERFUL THING TO WORK WITH THESE YOUNG PERFORMERS, AND WYNONNA RIDER AND THE FANS LOVE IT TO DEATH, AND I'M JUST BLESSED AGAIN TO BE INVITED TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SPECIAL. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, WE'RE BLESSED THAT YOU ARE. LOVELY TO SEE YOU, SEAN. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: "STRANGER THINGS" IS ON NETFLIX NOW. SEAN ASTIN, EVERYBODY.
