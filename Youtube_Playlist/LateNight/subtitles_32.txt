GOES, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM "FROZEN," "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST," AND "THE BOOK OF MORMON." HE DOES A LITTLE LESS SINGING IN "MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS." &gt;&gt; YOU STOLE FROM ME! THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE FOUND OUT, THAT IS WHY YOU KILLED HIM! YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I STOLE FROM HIM. THOUSANDS. I KNEW HIS MONEY WASN'T HONEST. WHAT DID IT MATTER IF I SKIMMED SOME OFF THE TOP? BUT LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION -- WHY WOULD I SLAUGHTER MY CASH COW? I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T KILL HIM! &gt;&gt; Stephen: I THINK HE DID (WHISPERING). PLEASE WELCOME JOSH GAD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) YOU TOTALLY KILLED HIM. &gt;&gt; CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING BEFORE WE BEGIN IN ALL THIS? YOU ARE SO BRILLIANT. I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR SPEECH BACKSTAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AMAZING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. &gt;&gt; Stephen: NICE OF YOU TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S BRILLIANT? &gt;&gt; NO, TELL ME. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OLAF FROM "FROZEN." &gt;&gt; THERE HE IS, FLYING! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS A MILESTONE IN AN ARTIST'S CAREER. SO FEW -- MORE PEOPLE LANDED ON THEIR MOON THAN HAVE THEIR OWN MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE BALLOON. &gt;&gt; IS THAT TRUE? &gt;&gt; Stephen: WE LOOKED IT UP. MORE PEOPLE HAVE LANDED ON THE MOON THAN HAVE THEIR OWN BALLOON. YOU'RE THENAUT. &gt;&gt; I'M SO SORRY TO N.A.S.A. ABOUT THIS FACT. I FEEL LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE A STEPHEN COLBERT BALLOON AS WELL! WOULD THAT BE WEIRD? &gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M WORKING ON IT. YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS YEAR IS THE FIRST TIME? &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOING TO BE THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, OLAF WILL BE FLYING IN THE MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE. AS A KID, I WOULD WATCH THIS ALL THE TIME, AND I WAS NEVER, LIKE, ONE DAY, I'LL BE A SNOWMAN, AND THAT SNOWMAN WILL HAVE HIS OWN BALLOON! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, IF THIS HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE PARADE BEFORE, WHAT ARE WE SEEING? &gt;&gt; I THINK OLAF WAS JUST, LIKE, I'M NOT GONNA WAIT ANY LONGER, I'M GONNA GO FLY! &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU GET TO RIDE IN IT THE WHOLE WAY. &gt;&gt; IS THIS THE ENTIRE TIME. I'M UP THERE PILOTING IT. THIS IS CRAZY! WOW! &gt;&gt; Stephen: LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY. WHO WANTS TO GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE PARADE, BULLWINKLE, POKEÉMON -- &gt;&gt; POKEÉMON, AFTER PLAYING THE GAME RELENTLESSLY LAST YEAR AND WATCHING YOUR COLD OPENING, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO GO ( LAUGHTER ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, PROBABLY, PROBABLY. SO HERE'S THE DEAL, YOU'RE OLAF'S VOICE IN "FROZEN." YOU'VE DONE FIVE OTHER PROJECTS. &gt;&gt; AS OLAF. &gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT THE SEQUEL HASN'T COME OUT YET. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT IF IT HAD COME OUT? &gt;&gt; Stephen: ( LAUGHTER ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN AD OR TWO. &gt;&gt; THE SEQUEL NOBODY'S SEEN. &gt;&gt; Stephen: DISNEY DOESN'T LIKE TO ADVERTISE. &gt;&gt; NO, THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, WE'RE WORKING ON IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT ARE THE OTHER FIVE THINGS? &gt;&gt; THERE ARE ALL THESE FROZEN SHORTS. ONE IS CALLED OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE IN FRONT OF COCOA, THE PIXAR MOVIE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THERE A OLAF CHIP IN YOUR NECK SO THEY CAN THROW A BAG OVER YOUR HEAD AND DRAG YOU OFF -- &gt;&gt; THAT'S VIE WHRENT. I DON'T DO THAT. THAT'S EXCESSIVE. I DO IT ALL THE TIME TO MY KIDS. I READ CONSTANTLY TO THEM. I READ THEM "FROZEN." &gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOUR CHILDREN? &gt;&gt; NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ON WHETHER THEY ARE OF TARGET AGE FOR FROZEN. &gt;&gt; 22 AND 25, STEPHEN. &gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY? YOU LOOK FANTASTIC. &gt;&gt; 58, BROTHER. 58. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU HAVE TO SEND ME YOUR MOISTURIZER REGIMEN. &gt;&gt; 3 AND 6. &gt;&gt; Stephen: BOYS, GIRLS? BOTH GIRLS. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY ALL WANT TO BE -- &gt;&gt; ELSA, ANNA. NOBODY WANTS TO BE ME IN MY HOUSEHOLD. IT'S SAD. ( LAUGHTER ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU WERE THE REINDEER OR THE BIG FROST MONSTER. ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU READ EVERYTHING AS OLAF? &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S MY VOICE, SO I REALLY -- ( APPLAUSE ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: I KNOW THAT! I KNOW THAT! &gt;&gt; SURPRISE! &gt;&gt; Stephen: GO AHEAD.

FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO -- ( LAUGHTER ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, THEY SAY LINCOLN ACTUALLY SOUNDED LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; READY? I'M FREDDY KRUEGER -- ( LAUGHTER ) SO SAD. &gt;&gt; Stephen: VERY NICE. ARE THEY SAYING DO IT AS OLAF OR READ AS DADDY? &gt;&gt; THEY SAY READ AS DADDY, NOT AS OLAF. I'M, LIKE, I DON'T DECIPHER BETWEEN THE TWO. IT'S ME, DADDY! AND DADDY MAKES ONE CHOICE! ( LAUGHTER ) DADDY DOESN'T HAVE A CHARACTER. DADDY IS A CHARACTER! &gt;&gt; DADDY IS A CHARACTER! &gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, SO, NOW, I'VE GOT TO THANK YOU FOR SOMETHING. WE HAD THE #PUBERME CHALLENGE, WHERE WE RAISED MONEY FOR PUERTO RICO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOU JOINED IN THE #PUBERME CHALLENGE AND WE GAVE $1,000 TO PUERTO RICO FOR EVERY PERSON WHO JOINED IN. AND THIS IS YOUR PUR #PUBERME -- LOOK AT THAT.

I HAD A DRUM THEMED HAT FOR MY BAR MITS VIRGINIA BUT THIS IS ME HITTING THE BAR MITZVAH CIRCUIT AND THIS IS CALLED COOL DESPITE THE ACNE LOOK. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WERE YOU BIG ON THE CIRCUIT? &gt;&gt; HUGE ON THE CIRCUIT. I WAS THE BAR MITZVAH CIRCUIT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: UNTIL YOU GOT THERE, THEY WEREN'T OFFICIALLY A MAN.
