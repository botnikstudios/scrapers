THEN WE DID, THE DANA CARVY SHOW TOGETHER. WE WERE OFFICE MATE THERE. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OFFICE MATES AT THE DAILY SHOW FOREVER. &gt;&gt; YUP. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU ARE POUND FOR POUND ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO DRAMA, MAN? YOU'RE HURTING OUR FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME TO HAVE SOME PRETENSE IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY. HAVE YOU TRIED NOT PRONOUNCING THE LAST CONSONANT OF YOUR LAST NAME? THAT'S HOW I GET MINE IN. &gt;&gt; I LIKE IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH. BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE TREMENDOUS WORK. OBVIOUSLY I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO IT, BECAUSE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. PEOPLE ASK ME, LIKE WOW, IN "FOX CATCHER" HE WAS REALLY SCARY, I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. I SAID NO, I ALWAYS KNEW HE COULD PLAY A PSYCHOTIC. &gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THAT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME. &gt;&gt; WELL, I MEAN, RIGHT BACK AT YOU, THOUGH. THERE IS NO ONE-- SERIOUSLY, THERE IS NO ONE I WOULD RATHER PERFORM WITH THAN YOU. &gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY? &gt;&gt; SERIOUSLY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY. &gt;&gt; TO BE ON-- BUT IT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS. &gt;&gt; CUZ I ALWAYS KNEW, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS, WE'RE ALWAYS FUNNY TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER). &gt;&gt; Stephen: I WILL TRY MY DRAMATIC CHOPS BE YOU RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALWAYS SO ON POINT AND SO GREAT AND YOU CAN-- I DON'T KNOW. EVERYONE'S BORED WITH US. (LAUGHTER). &gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT I'M ENJOYING THIS CONVERSATION. &gt;&gt; I AM TOO. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. LET'S TALK ABOUT "THE BIG SHORT" FOR A SECOND. I'M FASCINATED BY THIS MOVIE. I LOVE THE IDEA OF THIS MOVIE. SO YOU PLAY A GUY, LET ME GET THIS, MARK BALM, ALL RIGHT, BASED ON A REAL HEDGE FUND MANAGER NAMED STEVE EISMAN, BEFORE THE 2008 CRASH. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: HE SEES SOMETHING COMING. WHAT DOES HE SEE COMING? &gt;&gt; HE SAW THE BUBBLE. HE SAW THE HOUSING BUBBLE. HE SAW THAT ALL OF THESE MORTGAGES WERE GOING TO DEFAULT AND HE AND A-- . &gt;&gt; Stephen: A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE SAW IT WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE SAW IT COMING AND ESSENTIALLY BET AGAINST THE U.S. ECONOMY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT THEY WERE CRAZY. &gt;&gt; EVERYONE THOUGHT IT THEY WERE CRAZY AND IT'S WEIRD WATCHING THE MOVIE. YOU THINK WHO ARE THE HEROES HERE. BECAUSE YOU KIND OF ROOT FOR THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT IF THE HEROES OF OUR MOVIE ACTUALLY GET WHAT THEY WANT, ACTUAL OF US LOSE. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY. AND YOU STILL KIND OF ROOT FOR IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE WALKING AROUND ON THE MOVIE, THIS IS-- WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE MOVIE, WHAT TERRIFIED ME WAS, I HAD FORGOT ENHOW CLOSE WE CAME TO A GLOBAL MELTDOWN. LIKE $17 TRILLION DISAPPEARED OVERNIGHT BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. &gt;&gt; IT, WELL, AND HAD THE GOVERNMENT NOT BAILED OUT THE BANKS, WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED THERE. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE TIME. YOU KNOW, YOU READ THE PAPER AND YOU WATCH THE NEWS. BUT THE EXTENT OF IT, I HAD NO IDEA. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOU DID NOT-- YOU DON'T REALLY DEEPLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS. &gt;&gt; ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; Stephen: ANYTHING, RIGHT. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT, THAT THAT IS A VERY ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF WALL STREET IN 2008. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY GOOD WORK. REALLY GOOD WORK. (APPLAUSE) AND THE MOVIE IS WITH ADAM McKAY, WHO "ANCHORMAN" ONE AND TWO. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF DOING "ANCHORMAN" WITH HIM AND DOING A DRAMA ABOUT THE WORLDWIDE COLLAPSE OF OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; IT'S ACTUALLY CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD THINK. BECAUSE ADAM, WHEN WE WERE DOING "ANCHORMAN" HE IS THE FUNNIEST GUY, HE SITS BEHIND A MONITER WITH A MICROPHONE AND SHOUTS OUT THINGS LIKE, I POOPED A DHOK LAT SCWIREL. AND YOU SAY THAT, NOT IN THIS MOVIE AND THE BUT THE OTHER MOVIE. AND YOU JUST SAY THINGS THAT HE SAYS. AND HE'S INCREDIBLY SMART AND FUNNY. FOR THIS MOVIE, HE STILL HAD HIS MIC BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S LIKE GO, IMPROVISE ABOUT, YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; DERIFF TIFFS AND. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND YOU WOULD TRY TO HAVE SOME THINGS IN YOUR BACK POCKET THAT YOU COULD THEN IMPROVISE ON. &gt;&gt; Stephen: COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS, MAKE IT EXCITING, GO. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
