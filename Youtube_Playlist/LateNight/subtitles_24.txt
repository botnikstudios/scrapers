DISNEY! &gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND SO-- AND SO I SAID I WOULD DO THAT, BUT I HAD NEVER DONE INSTAGRAM LIVE SO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW IT WORKED. &gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE ARE YOU A... &gt;&gt; GRANDPA! &gt;&gt; Stephen: YES. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A GRANDPA MOVE. I WENT TO BED A LEADING MAN, AND SOMEHOW I WOKE UP A GRANDPA, OKAY. BUT I-- SO I WENT BACKSTAGE, AND I WAS-- I WAS DOING THE INSTAGRAM LIVE, AND IT WAS FUN AND GAMES AND EVERYONE LOVED IT. AND I WAS DOING THE AUDIENCE. AND THEN THEY SAID, "RETURN TO YOUR SEAT. WE'RE GOING TO START MOVIE. OF THE SO I PUSHED THE BUTTON, WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING TO STOP IT, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER BUTTON TO STOP IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DID THE FIRST BUTTON DO? &gt;&gt; THE FIRST BUTTON JUST TELLS YOU TO PUSH THE SECOND BUTTON TO STOP IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY NOT MAKE THE FIRST BUTTON TO STOP IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I SAID! &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO? &gt;&gt; SO I ENDED UP SHOVING IT IN MY POCKET AND SITTING DOWN AND WATCHING THE MOVIE. WELL, IT WAS LIVE. ( LAUGHTER ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO IT WAS BROADCASTING... &gt;&gt; IT'S BROADCASTING TO THE MOVIE BASICALLY FREE TO MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF HOPEFULLY PAYING VIEWERS.

AND I MUST GOT 50 TEXTS IN 10 MINUTES. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SAYING, "STOP THIS, YOU IDIOT." &gt;&gt; OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE SAYING BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE AND TAKE OUT MY PHONE AND LOOK AT THE TEXT S. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN A MOVIE! YOU'RE AN A-HOLE IF YOU DO THAT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU HAVE IT WITH YOU? DO YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE WITH YOU? &gt;&gt; NO GOOD DEED-- YEAH, BUDDY. NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED. I'M SITTING THERE ENJOYING THE MOVIE WITH MY FAMILY, AND A WOMAN CAME UP AND SHE POKED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND I TURNED AND I SAID, "YEAH, WHAT, WHAT IN? AND SHE SAID, "YOUR PHONE IS ON! YOU'RE INSTAGRAMMING LIVE THIS WHOLE SHOW! YOU'VE BEEN INSTAGRAMMING LIVE FOR 10 MINUTES! TURN IT OFF!" ( LAUGHTER ) OH, NO. OH,-- OH, NO! "TURN IT OFF!" " "YEAH, YEAH, TURN TAKEOFF." 50 TEXTS.

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FIRE YOU BEFORE YOU'RE FINISHED. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT'S THE ONE YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; "INFINITE WAR TWO" OR "AVENGERS 3-- I MEAN "AVENGERS 4." &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO IT'S THE EIGHTH IN A SERIES. &gt;&gt; WE'RE DOING "AVENGERS 3 AND FOUR," OR "INFINITE WAR 1 AND TWO." I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN WILL THEY MAKE UP THEIR MIND? &gt;&gt; ONCE THEY TEST SCREEN TPROBABLY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: HAVE YOU DONE "INFINITE WAR 1 IN? AND "AVENGERS 3?" &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Stephen: AND WHEN DO WE GET TO SEE THAT? &gt;&gt; WHEN IT COMES OUT, STEVE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT I REALLY ENJOYED THE "THOR: RAGNAROK. &gt;&gt; YOU DID? &gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, I LOVED IT. &gt;&gt; DID YOU? YOU SAW IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I SAW IT ON A LITTLE SCREEN LYING IN BED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THIS WAS HILARIOUS. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I GOT TO SEE IT-- BECAUSE I'M SPECIAL EYE GOT TO SEE AT HOME ON A LITTLE LINK THEY SEND YOU. AND IT'S REALLY ENJOYABLE. IT'S REALLY GREAT. &gt;&gt; HOW GOOD WAS IT ON A SCALE OF 1-10. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Stephen: 1-10 LIKE-- &gt;&gt; 1 BEING NOT SO GOOD AND 10 BEING REALLY, REALLY AMAZING. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT WOULD BE 10. &gt;&gt; WHY, STEVE-- ( APPLAUSE ) I'D GO T SEE THAT MOVIE BASED ON THAT RECOMMENDATION. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO NEED MY RECOMMENDATION TO SEE THIS MOVIE. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S GOT SLOW SEENS SCOOENS IN IT WHEN YOU DON'T SEE. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TWO GUYS BROWING DOWN, HULK AND THOR APOLOGIZING TO EACH OTHER AFTER A TERRIBLE ARGUMENT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THE THOR-- THE THOR. THOR AND HULK-- AND HULK TALKS A LOT IN THIS. &gt;&gt; HE DOES. &gt;&gt; Stephen: DID YOU INSIST, "I'M GOING TO DO THIS MOVIE BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME WORDS TO SAY." &gt;&gt; I'M SO SICK OF GRUNTING. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING FOR (BLEEP). &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE HULK FOR MOST OF THE MOVIE. &gt;&gt; YEAH! WHAT'S HE LIKE TO BE A ROOMMATE WITH? HOW DOES HE EAT? HOW DOES HE DO STUFF? I'M SICK OF YELLING AND SCREAMING AND SMASHING ALL THE TIME, MAN! IT GETS OLD! &gt;&gt; Stephen: HULK'S GOT FEELINGS IN THIS ONE. HE HAS REGRETS. &gt;&gt; HE DOES. HE DOES. I THINK HE'S THE EMOTIONAL -- &gt;&gt; Stephen: THOR OF THE MOVIE WITHOUT A DOUBT. IT SHOULDN'T BE CALLED "THOR." IT SHOULD CALLED HULK. &gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT "THULK." &gt;&gt; Stephen: THULK, OR HOR. &gt;&gt; Stephen: "THOR: RAGNAROK" IS IN THEATERS FRIDAY.
