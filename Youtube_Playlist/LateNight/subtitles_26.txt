I MOVED TO AN ORANGE GROVE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I HEARD THIS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? YOU MOVED-- LIKE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE-- ARE YOU A HERMIT NOW? &gt;&gt; NO, NO. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU LIVE IN AN ORANGE GROVE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A WHOLE TOWN OF PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THERE A HOME THERE OR DO YOU JUST FROLLIC AMONG THE TREES? &gt;&gt; NO, I KIND OF WALK AROUND AND THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE ORANGES LIKE "HOW I MET YOUR MARMALADE." SOMETHING LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT WOULD SO SELL. &gt;&gt; I KNOW. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT WOULD SO SELL. CBS WOULD WANT THEIR BEAK WET, BUT THAT WOULD SELL. &gt;&gt; I DID A MOVIE CALLED "THE END OF THE TOUR." &gt;&gt; Stephen: I SAW, THAT BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE, BEAUTIFUL CHARACTER, I'M SURE. &gt;&gt; REALLY SCARY. I RENTED THIS ORANGE GROOVE TO READ INFINITE JEST, BECAUSE I'M NOT A -- &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU RENTED AN ORANGE GROVE TO READ A BOOK? &gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH. BECAUSE I HAD THE "HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER" MONEY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S A REAL HOLLYWOOD THING TO HAVE DONE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AND I WAS REALLY-- I WAS JUST, LIKE, REALLY HAPPY THERE, AND I DECIDED I'M GOING TO STAY. SO I NEVER EYE NEVER WENT BACK. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO IT WAS RENT TO OWN. &gt;&gt; YEAH, I ESSENTIALLY LEASED IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU LIVE THERE ALONE? &gt;&gt; NO, I HAVE A WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND, YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW. BUT I'M HAPPY FOR HER AND YOU. &gt;&gt; YEAH, WE'RE BOTH REALLY HAPPY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GREAT PLACE TO START A CULT. &gt;&gt; YES, YEAH. I'M RENT WRITING SCI-FI NOVELS AS WELL SO IT'S PERFECT. HEALTHTRONICS. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THE THING IS YOU RENTED-- I JUST WANT TO GO BACKUE RENTED AN ORANGE GROVE TO READ A BOOK. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: AND-- &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE-- HOW YOU DO THE BOOK READING. I-- ( LAUGHTER ) I-- &gt;&gt; Stephen: I LEASED AN AVOCADO FARM TO DO MY TAXES THIS PAST YEAR. &gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU GOT GET AWAY FROM IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE LITTLE PEOPLE DO IT, BUT WE JUST HAVE TO GET AWAY. I JUST CAN'T BE DISTRACTED. &gt;&gt; I USED TO THINK THE REASON YOU READ A BOOK WAS TO SAY YOU READ THE BOOK, BUT THIS TIME I HAD TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO NOT A BIG READER. &gt;&gt; I DO MORE WRITING THANE DO READING. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO NOW YOU LIVE ON THE ORANGE FARM YOU RENTED TO READ A BOOK AND NOW YOU'RE WRITING BOOKS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS JUR FIFTH BOOK, ISN'T IT? &gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S NUMBER FIVE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S CALLED "OTHERWORLD." &gt;&gt; ( APPLAUSE ). &gt;&gt; THANKS. &gt;&gt; Stephen: AND BOOK WRITING IS HARD. IT'S REALLY HARD WORK. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW WHAT-- WHY DOES THIS SEEM-- IS THIS HARDER OR EASIER THAN BEING AN ACTOR, IN YOUR OPINION? &gt;&gt; WELL, MY-- NO ONE WAS EVER KNOCKING DOWN MY DOOR TO PLAY CAPTAIN AMERICA, THAT'S WHAT MY CAREER WAS LIKE. I WROTE A LOT OF OF THE MOVIES I DID. I WROTE "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL" WHEN I WAS 24. AND I WROTE "THE MUPPETS" WITH A FRIEND OF MINE NICK ( APPLAUSE ). &gt;&gt; OH, THANKS, THANKS. PRETTY COOL. BUT, HONESTLY, WHEN I WAS WORKING ON "THE MUPETS--" I WANT TO SAY THIS CORRECTLY IN CASE KIDS ARE WATCHING-- BUT THE MUPETS ARE PUPPETS, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ). &gt;&gt; Stephen: MUPPETS. &gt;&gt; WHEN KIDS WOULD COME TO MEET KERMIT, A PUPPETEER IS STANDING RIGHT THERE OPERATING KERMIT, BUT I NOTICED THE KID LOOKS DIRECTLY AT KERMIT. THEY DON'T SEE THE PUPPETEER STANDING NEXT TO THEM. AND I THOUGHT KIDS WANT TO USE THEIR IMAGINATION. THEY WANT TO BELIEVE. AND I WANTED TO START WRITING BOOKS FOR THEM, BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ A BOOK AS A KID YOU'RE DOING HALF THE WORK. I PROVIDE THE WORDS, AND THEIR IMAGINATION DOES THE REST OF THE STORY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS YOUR FIRST YOUNG ADULT NOVEL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: Y.A. WHAT QUALIFIES Y.A.? WHAT'S THAT CATEGORY? &gt;&gt; IT'S 16 AND UP. I GET REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THOSE KIDS, BECAUSE I FELT INFERIOR TO THEM WHEN I WAS 16 AND CONTINUE TO. ( LAUGHTER ). &gt;&gt; Stephen: MY CHILDREN ARE ALL 16 UP AND, AND THEY'RE WAY SMARTER THAN I AM. &gt;&gt; YEAH -- &gt;&gt; Stephen: I COULDN'T DO THEIR HOMEWORK. &gt;&gt; I WAS AT A RESTAURANT THE OTHER DAY, AND THE VALET PARKER CAME AROUND. HE WAS, LIKE, A 16-YEAR-OLD KID STEPPED OUT OF THE CAR AND I WAS INSTANTLY LIKE, "OH, MAN, HE'S SO MUCH COOLER THAN ME." &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? I BET HE THOUGHT SO, TOO. THAT'S NATURE OF 16-YEAR-OLDS. HOW OLD ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; I'M 37 NOW. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OLD MAN. &gt;&gt; LOOK LIKE THE VICE PRINCIPAL. I WANTED TO INGRAISHATE MYSELF TO THE KID MAKE HIM, I WAS COOL, TOO, AND I TRIED TO MAKE SMALL TALK, "YEAH, LOOKS LIKE SUMMER IS OVER, HEY, BRO." &gt;&gt; Stephen: DID YOU ACTUALLY SAY "HEY, BRO." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, ," YEAH, THE BRAKES ARE ON." I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT. AND I SAID, "OH, YEAH, BRAKES ARE ON! BRAKES ARE ON! THEY'RE ON!" &gt;&gt; Stephen: THE IDEA BEING THAT SUMMER IS OVER AND, THEREFORE, THE BRAKES ARE ON, BECAUSE THE FUN BREAKS. &gt;&gt; I GOT IN THE CAR TO DRIVE AWAY AND THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ON. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SO LITERALLY THE BRAKES WERE ON. LITERALLY THE BRAKES WERE ON. &gt;&gt; YEAR, I'VE BEEN-- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT INTERACTION FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS NOW. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WOW. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WENT FOR IT. "THE BRAKES ARE ON!" YOU SAID IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: MAYBE WE CAN GET IT STARTED. MAYBE WE CAN GET IT STARTED. WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO MEAN? LET'S TRY TO GET IT IT STARTED. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DOES IT MEANS, THE BRAKES ARE ON! WE HAD A GOOD TIME BUT NOW MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GET DOWN TO WORK. &gt;&gt; I'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO FOR A LONG TIME WHEN SOMEONE INSULTS SOMEONE TRYING TO MAKE, "OH, YOU'VE GOT MAIL." ( LAUGHTER ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: I KNOW YOU'RE MY GUEST. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU WITH THAT ONE. ( LAUGHTER ). &gt;&gt; OH,-- RETURN TO SENDER! &gt;&gt; Stephen: I WANT TO GET THIS ONE STARTED. MY FRIEND PAUL AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS ONE STARTED. IT'S-- WE'RE TRYING TO GET TEENS TO USE THIS TERM, "OH, THAT'S MASSIVE." WHEN SOMETHING IS REALLY GOOD, "THAT'S MASSIVE." &gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN EXPRESSION AS MUCH AS AN ADJECTIVE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: "DO YOU LIKE MY SUIT?" "IT'S MASSIVE." IT'S PERFECT, IT'S PERFECT. &gt;&gt; "BRAKES ARE ON." &gt;&gt; Stephen: A THIRD PARTY RIGHT NOW SHOULD LOOK AT ME AND SAY, "OH, YOU'VE GOT MAIL." &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD, TOTALLY! &gt;&gt; Stephen: RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE PERFECT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ADD THAT GLAERT WE'LL DO IT POST. IT WILL ALL BE DIGITAL. YOU'VE BEEN A MOVIE STAR, A TV STAR. NOW YOU'RE A STAR IT'S PREVIOUS SERIES LIKE THIS, THERE ARE, LIKE, FIVE BOOKS IN IT. SOMEBODY WILL MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF THIS STUFF. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A BOOK STAR, TO BE OUT WITH KIDS-- AND ADULTS, I ASSUME, AT A READING? IS IT DIFFERENT? &gt;&gt; IT'S FUNNY YOU SAID THAT. WHEN YOU GO TO THESE READINGS, HONESTLY, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COME BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BOOK, BUT THE PARENTS WANT TO MEET THE GUY FROM "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL." AND THEY-- WELL, IT'S REALLY A DIFFERENT CROWD. AND SOMETIMES THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF DOING, LIKE, WINE EVENTS BEFORE THESE KIDS BOOK EVENTS. AND I JUST DID ONE -- &gt;--&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY GET YOU DRUNK? &gt;&gt; NO, THEY GIVE THE PARENTS-- THEY GIVE THEM SOME ROSE WHILE THE KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK ME PARENTS. THE OTHER DAY, THE FIRST SIX ROSE WERE KIDS, AND THE REST WERE PARENTS. AND I CAME OUT, "I THINK I'LL START READING THE FIRST PAGES OF THIS BOOK." AND A WOMAN SAID, "OR YOU COULD JUST TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ). &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S AN OPTION. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT WAS SAD? I MADE EYE CONTACT WITH THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, NO, OH, NO. &gt;&gt; AND THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS THAT SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY. SO, I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ THE BOOK HERE BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT. &gt;&gt; QUICKLY, SINCE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. BASICALLY, IF THE KIDS FROM FREAKFREAKS AND GEEKS GOT SUCKED INTO DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S A QUICK PITCH. DID YOU PLAY D&amp; "D." &gt;&gt; I PLAYED "MIST." &gt;&gt; Stephen: I REMEMBER "MIST." &gt;&gt; I I WAS TERRIBLE AT IT. &gt;IWOULD WANDER AROUND. AND THE BOOK IS ABOUT WHAT IF A COMPANY LIKE AMAZON CREATED A VIRTUAL WORLD SO SEDUCTIVE NOBODY WANTED TO LEAVE. YEAH? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M IN. I'M IN. I CAN KEEP THIS? &gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S ALL YOURS. I'LL SIGN IT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; Stephen: JACEOB, LOVELY TO SEE YOU. "OTHERWORLD" IS ON SALE NOW. JASON SEGEL, EVERYBODY.
