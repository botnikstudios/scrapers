SO DOES MY WHOLE HOUSE NOW THANKS TO HIM. DOES HE CALL YOUR ASSISTANT AND ASK FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S SHOW SOTHAT HE CAN THEN CALL YOU AND TELL YOU HOW GREAT IT WAS THE NEXT DAY? &gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, GOD, GOD, I HOPE NOT! BECAUSE IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU HAVE JUST BLOWN AN ILLUSION THAT I I THOUGHT HE ACTUALLY WATCHES WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING. &gt;&gt; MAYBE OCCASIONALLY, BUT RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT EVEN WATCHING THIS. HE'S GOT TWO CLIENTS ON AT ONCE AND HE'S OUTSIDE SMOKING. DOES HE BRAG ABOUT HOW MANY HOUSES HIGH OWNS AND COUNTRY CLUBS HE BELONGS TO IN YOUR PRESENCE? &gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S VERY PROUD OF THAT. &gt;&gt; HAS HE EVER USED THE SENTENCE, "I'VE GOT TOO MANY CARS," WHEN IT SNOWS IN FRONT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THE THING IS, HE'S-- IT'S YOU, ME, JON STEWART.
