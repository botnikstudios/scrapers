( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT FROM HIS WORK ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." HE CURRENTLY STARS AS KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON." PLEASE WELCOME, TARAN KILLAM! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) &gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU, THANK YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH! VERY NICE PEOPLE! &gt;&gt; Stephen: VERY NICE. THE NICEST OF PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME IN THE CONTENSIONLE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE WELCOME. &gt;&gt; Stephen: LONELY IN THERE. I DON'T THINK I HAVE BEEN JOINED IN THERE BEFORE. &gt;&gt; JUST STARTED CRAWLING THERE FROM BACKSTAGE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU ARE KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON" NOW. &gt;&gt; YES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; Stephen: DID YOU TAKE IT JUST FOR THE PART OR IS IT THE ONLY WAY TO GET TICKETS TO "HAMILTON" AT THIS POINT? &gt;&gt; BOTH A AND B AT THIS POINT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A SINGER. &gt;&gt; WHAT I STARTED OUT DOING. I WENT TO COLLEGE FOR MUSICAL THEATER AND THEN COMEDY TOOK OVER. &gt;&gt; Stephen: STARTED IN MUSICAL THEATER AND DECIDED TO GO FOR THE BIG MONEY IN COMEDY! &gt;&gt; IT HAS WORKED OUT AND IT'S AN HONOR. THE SHOW IS INCREDIBLE. YOU'VE ALLIN' IT, RIGHT? SORRY! SORRY TO RUB YOUR NOSE IN THAT. NO, IT'S SO AMAZING. I WAS A HUGE FAN OF IT AND I KNOW LYNN AND TOMMY AND THEY INVITED ME TO BE A PART OF THE SHOW. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'VE HAD ANDREW REYNOLDS AND JOHN GRAF TO TALK ABOUT PLAYING THE PART BEFORE YOU. THE CROWN IS THE WORST PART OF IT. &gt;&gt; IT STINKS. IT'S SO HEAVY. YOU'RE IN HEELS. AND FOR THE FIRST PART YOU HAVE A GIANT VELVET CAPE SWAYING TO AND FROE, LIKE TOSSING YOU IN A SHIP. IT'S JUST THE JOB TO WALK A STRAIGHT LINE. IT'S A SELF-DEFEATING ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO WARDROBE. I THINK I'M THE TALLEST. IN THE HEELS AND CROWN, I HAVE TO DUCK UNDER THE SET WHEN I MAKE MY ENTRANCES AND MY THIRD SHOW EVER, I DID NOT. IT KNOCKED THE CROWN TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD LIKE A PRECOCIOUS APPLE DUMPLING GANG CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THE KING! YEAH, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN THERE'S THE PART WHERE I HAVE TO, LIKE, SKIP IN JOY, AND I DO THAT, AND FOR ME IT WAS LIKE SLOW MOTION, THE CROWN COMES OFF AND SMASHES ON THE STAGE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: DID IT GET A LAUGH? &gt;&gt; A HUGE LAUGH. IT WAS GREAT. YOU LITERALLY CAN'T FAIL IN THAT ROLE. IT'S SO NICE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THE SHOW AND PEOPLE PULL ALL KINDS OF STRINGS TO GET IN THERE. PEOPLE COME BACKSTAGE, LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MEETING THAT PERSON! NOT LIKE YOU DON'T MEET A LOT OF FAMOUS PEOPLE. LIKE WORLD LEADERS COME. &gt;&gt; TRUE. FOR MESARA MICHELLE GELLAR CAME LAST WEEK. &gt;&gt; Stephen: BUFFY? BUFFY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WORLD LEADER. WORLD LEADER. DIMENSIONAL LEADER, REALLY, IF WE'RE GETTING TECHNICAL. THE FIRST TIME, MAYBE THE ONLY TIME I'VE CRIED IN EARNEST AT NARRATIVE TELEVISION WAS ON BUFFY WHEN ANGEL LOSES HIS SOUL AGAIN AND SHE HAS TO STAB HIM THROUGH THE HEART TO CLOSE THE HELL MOUTH. ( LAUGHTER ) I PLAYED IT MUCH COOLER THAN NOW. I WAS LIKE, THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE SHOW, I'M A HUGE FAN, BUFFY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! AND I RAN BACKSTAGE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE FAMOUS FOR YOUR IMPRESSIONS. IMPRESSIONS THAT NOBODY HAD A HOOK FOR. NOBODY DID BRAD PITTT AND YOU HAD A HOOK FOR BRAD PITT. McConaughey is a very small needle to thread. YOU MUST RUN INTO THEM AFTER DOING THEIR IMPRESSIONS. &gt;&gt; NO ONE LIKES THEIR IMPRESSION. SO THEY'LL QUICKLY SKIRT TO YOU DO THIS PERSON GREAT AND THAT PERSON GREAT, YOU REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ME. THAT IS WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY. BUT I WAS BACKSTAGE AT THE 40th, SOMEBODY WHO I GOT TO MEET AND NEVER GOT TO DO ON THE SHOW, IT WAS MY FAVORITE EXPERIENCE IN PASSING, 40t 40th WAS CRAZY. THERE'S TONS OF PEOPLE THERE FROM ALL GENERATIONS OF THE SHOW. &gt;&gt; Stephen: 40t 40th ANNIVERSARY. &gt;&gt; OF "SNL," EXACTLY. I SEE OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE JEFF GOLDBLUM WALKS UP AND AIM BIG FAN, HE SAYS, YES, YES, YES, YES, GOOD, VERY GOOD, THEN KEPT WALKING. I'M, LIKE, THAT'S IT. I'M DONE. THAT'S ALL I NEED, IF I DO NOTHING ELSE. THAT'S IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS, THIS SEASON "SNL" IS HAVING AN AMAZING SEASON, THE RATINGS ARE GREAT, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT AND THE SHOW HAS BEEN WONDERFUL. ALEC BALD WITHIN, McCARTHY, SEAN SPICER IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE I'VE EVER SEEN. PEOPLE WHO COME IN WHO WEREN'T EVEN THE HOST THAT WEEK, WHEN NON-CAST MEMBERS COME IN AND DO THE IMPRESSIONS, DOES THE CAST THERE GO, HEY, WE'RE THE ENSEMBLE, WHY AREN'T WE DOING THOSE? I FEEL BAD FOR THE CAST WHO DON'T GET A CHOMP AT THAT. &gt;&gt; NO, IT'S DONE WELL. I WAS THERE WHEN THEY HAD LARRY DAVID COME IN FOR BERNIE SANDERS, AND IT'S ALWAYS WITHIN SORT OF THE FAMILY OF COMEDY AND PEOPLE THAT WE RESPECT. SO I THINK IT'S MORE THAN ANYTHING JUST AS EXCITING FOR US. I MEAN, MELISSA WAS THE PERSON, I CAME FROM THE THEATER IN LOS ANGELES AND SHE DID AS WELL, AND MELISSA WAS THE PERSON WHO I WOULD GO OUT OF THE WAY TO SEE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: SHE'S EXTRAORDINARY. &gt;&gt; SHE'S A GENIUS. &gt;&gt; Stephen: DID YOU EVER DO SCHWARZENEGGER? &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T DO HIM ON THE SHOW BUT DIRECTED HIM IN A MOVIE THIS PAST SUMMER WHICH WAS VERY COOL, VERY EXCITING FOR ME. I DIRECTED A FILM WHY ARE WE KILLING DON'TER, A MOCKMENTRY ABOUT CONTRACT KILLERS TRYING TO KILL THE MOST FAMOUS HIT MAN TO USURP THE KING AND WE GOT ARNOLD TO BE GUNTHER, SPOILER ALERT. IT WAS CRAZY BECAUSE I FACETIMEED WITH HIM. MY ASSISTANT SAID I'M GOING TO HAND YOU TO ARNOLD NOW, HE WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF A SIX FOOT DESK, SMOKING CIGAR BEHIND A PICTURE FROM HIS PUMPING IRON DAYS. HE SAID, HELLO, TARAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU! THIS WAS THE BEFORE, THIS THIS I AFTER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) &gt;&gt; Stephen: TARAN KILLAM, ON BROAD WAY AT THE RICHARD RODGERS THEATRE! STICK AROUND! RAE SREMMURD NEXT!
