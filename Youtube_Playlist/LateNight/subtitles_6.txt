( LAUGHTER ). &gt;&gt; Stephen: REAL QUICK, THOUGH, I DO WANT TO TELL THIS ONE STORY. IT WAS A REALLY STRESSFUL SHOW. WE WERE CANCELED. LET'S PUT THAT-- &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WE WERE CANCELED AT SEVEN SHOWS. AIFT THEM WERE MADE, SEVEN OF THEM WERE BROADCAST. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY? &gt;&gt; IT WAS A FUNNY SHOW. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU WERE A HEAD WRITER. IT WAS A STRESSFUL SITUATION TO BE IN. &gt;&gt; I WAS 26 YEARS OLD SO I WAS A LITTLE OVER MY HEAD. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WOW, ROCKIN' THAT LEMON YELLOW SWEATER. I THINK IT WAS AFTER THE VERY FIRST SHOW WE WHERE DANA WAS BREAST FEEDING PUPPIES AND KITTENS DRESSED AS BILL CLINTON. &gt;&gt; WITH MILK SPURTING OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: AND PEOPLE OPERATING BULBS WITH MILK-- &gt;&gt; AND REAL LIVE PUPPIES AND KITTEN S. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT DIDN'T GO WELL. I COME AROUND A CORNER AND WE HAD ALL THESE LITTLE OFFICES AND I COME AROUND THE CORNER, AND YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY OPENLY WEEPING. &gt;&gt; EVIDENCE CRYING, RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU REMEMBER WHY? &gt;&gt; I WENT INTO YOUR-- THEY HAD THESE LITTLE STALLS FOR QUICK CHANGING. I WAS IN YOUR STALL -- &gt;&gt; Stephen: I DRAGGED YOU INTO THE STALL BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR THE HEAD WRITER TO BE OPENLY WEEPING. &gt;&gt; IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: BETWEEN TWO SHOWS SO I DRAGGED YOU IN AND DID PRATFALLS FOR YOU TO MAKE YOU LAUGH. &gt;&gt; YOU MADE ME LAUGH. THAT'S WHEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH STEPHEN UNTIL THAT MOMENT I THOUGHT HE WAS AN ALIEN WHO HAD COME-- LAUGH AND THEN THAT DAY-- IT WAS A TERRIBLE DAY. SKETCH COMEDY IS STRESSFUL. IT'S WEIRD THAT IT IS, BUT SKETCH COMEDY IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO. &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S HARDER THAN ANYTHING. IT'S LIKE WRITING SONNETS. EVERY SINGLE ONE HAS A BEGINNING, MIDEXPEL END. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: AND IT'S OVER IN THREE TO EIGHT MINUTES AND YOU TO GO ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; IT WAS VERY STRESSFUL AND I WAS SHAKING AND CRYING AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW YOU VERY WELL. AND YOU SAID, "COME ON." AND YOU TOOK ME INTO YOUR LITTLE ROOM. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND YOU OPENED YOUR PANTS EYE DON'T KNOW WHY. ( LAUGHTER ). &gt;&gt; Stephen: GOT A LAUGH, THOUGH. THAT'S WHY. GOT A LAUGH. EXACTLY. &gt;&gt; NO, YOU WERE JUST VERY KIND TO ME. YOU WERE VERY KIND TO ME. STEVE SEN VERY KIND-- YOU CAN TELL BY LISTENING TO HIM TALK. &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE A VERY KIND PERSON, TOO. YOU'RE VERY SWEET. SHOULD I GO TO A BREAK? WHO IS THIS MEAN, TAKE A BREAK? WE'LL TAKE A BREAK AND BE BACK WITH MORE LOUIS C.K.
