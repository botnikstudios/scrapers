-Thank you for coming back, because I love having you on. I really do. I want to go -- -I love being here. [ Laughter ] I saw the 15-minute segment you did... [ Laughter ] -What are you talking about? -...making fun of my damn album cover. -I didn't make -- I'm not making fun of it. -Can you try to help me sell records for once? Can you do something that promotes me? -What is the situation? Are you, like, thinking about what to do with the boat? [ Laughter ] Like, what -- what -- what are you thinking here? About memories of where you are? Is this Texoma Shore? -Right now, I'm -- I'm thinking about wishing I was there. [ Laughter ] -I know, I know! But are you here now? Is this photo of Texoma Shore? -Of course it is. That's the Texoma Shore. -But what are you thinking about? Some other place? [ Laughter ] Or memories of growing up, Texoma Shore, young little Blakey? [ Laughter ] Running around with his short-shorts on. [ Laughter ] "Ma, pa, I'm here! Am I late for dinner?" "Naw, don't worry about it, Blake. We're having the same thing we have every night." [ Laughter ] "Get over here, Blake. Get in here. And get me a whiskey!" "What's your problem, Dad? You never loved me." [ Laughter ] "Yeah, I do! I love you right now. Get over here, son." "Come here, Blakey." "I love you, Ma. I love you, Dad." [ Laughter ] Like, that type of thing. Is that the type of... [ Laughter and applause ] ...situation. [ Laughing ] Texoma Shore is a real place. I did not know that. -It's Lake Texoma in Oklahoma. Come on, man. -[ Woman cheers ] -Yeah, see? -Two people cheered. [ Laughter ] -What are you talking about? -What am I talking about. I never -- I really never heard of this. This is -- -Lake Texoma. So, it's the border of Oklahoma and Texas -- Lake Tex...oma. -Well, I get it now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought maybe you made it up and made up a word or something. [ Laughter ] You're an artist. -That's true. -You do things like that. You know, you make up words and stuff like that. -Would you interview me, for God sakes? [ Laughter ] -Let's talk about this. You're going on a tour. -Thank God. -Yeah, all right. You're going on tour. -Let's talk about it. -Yeah. Brett Eldridge. I love Brett Eldridge. Trace Adkins. -You know, Trace Adkins? -That's my dude. -Yeah. -Yeah. -He's taller than you, huh? -Little bit. -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -And Carly Pearce. -Carly Pearce is a new -- -Shorter than you. -New girl coming out in country music. -Yeah. -Got a huge hit out there. -Now, you can go to BlakeShelton.com, which I do every day. -Of course. [ Laughter ] -I just click refresh on my computer just to see what you're up to, man. -You do? [ Laughter ] -Yeah, BlakeShelton.com. So you write recipes and stuff like that. -Yeah. -You know, Pinterest pages. How to decorate your dorm room and stuff. [ Laughter ] I love your website. I'm always on your website. I know that you have a restaurant called Old Red. -Mm-hmm. -You do, for real. You opened a restaurant. -That's -- -Yeah. -You're teeing me up here now. [ Laughter ] -No, I've never been there. -You don't ask a question like a normal interviewer. Ask me a question. You just say it, and I didn't even get a chance to say it. -Old Red is the name of the restaurant. -Old Red is the name of the new restaurant in -- -The new restaurant is called Old Red. -This is unbelievable. Even the band -- -Well, it's just an ironic name for a new restaurant. "Here it is -- Old -- Here's an old new restaurant." [ Laughter ] Already my mind is boggled. I go in. I don't know what to expect. What do I go in when I go into Old Red? -Old Red is the new restaurant/bar music venue that is in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. I know you've heard of -- No. I know you've heard of Tishomingo. -I don't know if you're trying to catch me or something. -I've talked about it on this show. -Yeah. I've always listened. -This show. -Yeah, I always listen to you. -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -Tishomingo. That's where you live. -Yes. -You have a house there. And do you have a boat? [ Laughter ] Just setting you up, because Texoma Shore... How far away are you from the shore? [ Laughter ] How far away are you from -- -I'm not going to give you the location of my damn house. [ Laughter ] -Just have the Google digits. -Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. -What do you know about running a restaurant? Why would you do something like this? [ Laughter ] -What do you know about having a restaurant? -I would never run a restaurant. -You never had a restaurant. -No. No. I think I might have maybe almost invested in one and... -Just didn't. -Well, it's a bad investment. I mean, they -- it's -- [ Laughter ] I'm just saying -- No, I mean, it's really hard to run and maintain restaurants. I mean, I don't know why you would do this. [ Laughter ] But I hope it's a hit. I mean, in a -- [ Laughter ] People -- Everyone in Tishiwanga should go to, uh... [ Laughter ] ...Old Red. You know? You go in, you go, "I want the usual." [ Laughter ] Is it burgers and stuff and wings? [ Laughter ] I go into Old Red, right? -Yeah. -I've never been there before. What do I see? I walk in. What do I see? -You see tables. You see a bar. -Uh-huh. You see a -- There's a stage back there. -Is there, really? -Yeah. -Live music? -Of course. -Well, that's fantastic. -Yeah. -I didn't know that. I thought it was a restaurant. I thought it was like an Olive Garden. [ Laughter ] -Because you're opening another one, I hear. -Another Old Red, yes. In Nashville. -In Nashville. Old Red -- When you're here, you're family. [ Laughter ] -You made up a slogan for us. -Yeah. -I like it. -Where are you gonna open it? -In Nashville, Tennessee. [ Laughter ] -Yeah. I'd like to check it out. -Did I say that wrong? Did I say Nashville -- -No, I've heard of Nashville. It's great. I'm sure I've heard of the other location. [ Laughter ] But I'm excited for you. And I can tell that you're excited. -Can we play a game or something? -No, no, Blake, no, this -- [ Laughter and applause ] -Can we do karaoke? -Let's talk about -- No. -What about karaoke? -Let's talk about "Texoma Shore." "Texoma Shore" -- This is out this Friday. So you can preorder it now. You go to BlakeShelton.com. Or you go to probably Apple. [ Laughter ] Apple probably has it. iTunes has it. You know what? I want to talk about "The Voice." -Okay. [ Laughter ] 'Cause this is an interview, and I am doing a -- -You did a great job. -Thank you very much. -Great job. [ Laughter ] Who's a special guest coming up? Kelly Clarkson. -Kelly Clarkson, who's gonna be a coach next season. -I love Kelly Clarkson. She's great. -Me too. I do, too. She's been a friend for a long time. -Is that right? -Yeah. I think I met her, like, right after she won "American Idol." -Did you really? -She knows a thing or two about those singing shows. So she'd be great -- a great, uh... -She'll be fun to beat. [ Laughter ] -So you're going up against her? -Yeah, when she's a coach next season, I'm gonna be going up against her. -Oh, no. -Do you hear anything I say to you? -No. -No? -I have a clip. [ Laughter ] Here's Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson in an early look at next Monday's episode of "The Voice." -You've been drinking already, haven't you? -Check this out. -A little bit. So, before you beat me next year, will you help me this year? -Yeah. -Okay. -I don't think you're gonna beat me. -Are you serious? -Here's why. I think you're going to pass out during the blind auditions 'cause you can't stop talking... -Yeah. -...long enough to breathe. -This is a -- -So you'll be in the middle of a pitch, literally face first on your buzzer. -Nope. -Is it possible that you talk more than Miley? -[ Laughing ] [ Cheers and applause ] -She's coming on the show... Let's talk about "Texoma Shore." -Sure. -These are some of the songs on here. -Okay. -What are you -- ""You're Turning Me On." [ Laughter ] -That's a song on there, yes. -Yes.
