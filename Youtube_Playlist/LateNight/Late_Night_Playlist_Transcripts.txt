( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT FROM HIS WORK ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." HE CURRENTLY STARS AS KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON." PLEASE WELCOME, TARAN KILLAM! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )  THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU, THANK YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH! VERY NICE PEOPLE!  Stephen: VERY NICE. THE NICEST OF PEOPLE.  Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME IN THE CONTENSIONLE.  YOU'RE WELCOME.  Stephen: LONELY IN THERE. I DON'T THINK I HAVE BEEN JOINED IN THERE BEFORE.  JUST STARTED CRAWLING THERE FROM BACKSTAGE.  Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU ARE KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON" NOW.  YES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.  Stephen: DID YOU TAKE IT JUST FOR THE PART OR IS IT THE ONLY WAY TO GET TICKETS TO "HAMILTON" AT THIS POINT?  BOTH A AND B AT THIS POINT.  Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A SINGER.  WHAT I STARTED OUT DOING. I WENT TO COLLEGE FOR MUSICAL THEATER AND THEN COMEDY TOOK OVER.  Stephen: STARTED IN MUSICAL THEATER AND DECIDED TO GO FOR THE BIG MONEY IN COMEDY!  IT HAS WORKED OUT AND IT'S AN HONOR. THE SHOW IS INCREDIBLE. YOU'VE ALLIN' IT, RIGHT? SORRY! SORRY TO RUB YOUR NOSE IN THAT. NO, IT'S SO AMAZING. I WAS A HUGE FAN OF IT AND I KNOW LYNN AND TOMMY AND THEY INVITED ME TO BE A PART OF THE SHOW.  Stephen: WE'VE HAD ANDREW REYNOLDS AND JOHN GRAF TO TALK ABOUT PLAYING THE PART BEFORE YOU. THE CROWN IS THE WORST PART OF IT.  IT STINKS. IT'S SO HEAVY. YOU'RE IN HEELS. AND FOR THE FIRST PART YOU HAVE A GIANT VELVET CAPE SWAYING TO AND FROE, LIKE TOSSING YOU IN A SHIP. IT'S JUST THE JOB TO WALK A STRAIGHT LINE. IT'S A SELF-DEFEATING ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO WARDROBE. I THINK I'M THE TALLEST. IN THE HEELS AND CROWN, I HAVE TO DUCK UNDER THE SET WHEN I MAKE MY ENTRANCES AND MY THIRD SHOW EVER, I DID NOT. IT KNOCKED THE CROWN TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD LIKE A PRECOCIOUS APPLE DUMPLING GANG CHARACTER.  Stephen: THE KING! YEAH, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN THERE'S THE PART WHERE I HAVE TO, LIKE, SKIP IN JOY, AND I DO THAT, AND FOR ME IT WAS LIKE SLOW MOTION, THE CROWN COMES OFF AND SMASHES ON THE STAGE.  Stephen: DID IT GET A LAUGH?  A HUGE LAUGH. IT WAS GREAT. YOU LITERALLY CAN'T FAIL IN THAT ROLE. IT'S SO NICE.  Stephen: EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THE SHOW AND PEOPLE PULL ALL KINDS OF STRINGS TO GET IN THERE. PEOPLE COME BACKSTAGE, LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MEETING THAT PERSON! NOT LIKE YOU DON'T MEET A LOT OF FAMOUS PEOPLE. LIKE WORLD LEADERS COME.  TRUE. FOR MESARA MICHELLE GELLAR CAME LAST WEEK.  Stephen: BUFFY? BUFFY.  Stephen: WORLD LEADER. WORLD LEADER. DIMENSIONAL LEADER, REALLY, IF WE'RE GETTING TECHNICAL. THE FIRST TIME, MAYBE THE ONLY TIME I'VE CRIED IN EARNEST AT NARRATIVE TELEVISION WAS ON BUFFY WHEN ANGEL LOSES HIS SOUL AGAIN AND SHE HAS TO STAB HIM THROUGH THE HEART TO CLOSE THE HELL MOUTH. ( LAUGHTER ) I PLAYED IT MUCH COOLER THAN NOW. I WAS LIKE, THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE SHOW, I'M A HUGE FAN, BUFFY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! AND I RAN BACKSTAGE.  Stephen: YOU'RE FAMOUS FOR YOUR IMPRESSIONS. IMPRESSIONS THAT NOBODY HAD A HOOK FOR. NOBODY DID BRAD PITTT AND YOU HAD A HOOK FOR BRAD PITT. McConaughey is a very small needle to thread. YOU MUST RUN INTO THEM AFTER DOING THEIR IMPRESSIONS.  NO ONE LIKES THEIR IMPRESSION. SO THEY'LL QUICKLY SKIRT TO YOU DO THIS PERSON GREAT AND THAT PERSON GREAT, YOU REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ME. THAT IS WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY. BUT I WAS BACKSTAGE AT THE 40th, SOMEBODY WHO I GOT TO MEET AND NEVER GOT TO DO ON THE SHOW, IT WAS MY FAVORITE EXPERIENCE IN PASSING, 40t 40th WAS CRAZY. THERE'S TONS OF PEOPLE THERE FROM ALL GENERATIONS OF THE SHOW.  Stephen: 40t 40th ANNIVERSARY.  OF "SNL," EXACTLY. I SEE OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE JEFF GOLDBLUM WALKS UP AND AIM BIG FAN, HE SAYS, YES, YES, YES, YES, GOOD, VERY GOOD, THEN KEPT WALKING. I'M, LIKE, THAT'S IT. I'M DONE. THAT'S ALL I NEED, IF I DO NOTHING ELSE. THAT'S IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS, THIS SEASON "SNL" IS HAVING AN AMAZING SEASON, THE RATINGS ARE GREAT, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT AND THE SHOW HAS BEEN WONDERFUL. ALEC BALD WITHIN, McCARTHY, SEAN SPICER IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE I'VE EVER SEEN. PEOPLE WHO COME IN WHO WEREN'T EVEN THE HOST THAT WEEK, WHEN NON-CAST MEMBERS COME IN AND DO THE IMPRESSIONS, DOES THE CAST THERE GO, HEY, WE'RE THE ENSEMBLE, WHY AREN'T WE DOING THOSE? I FEEL BAD FOR THE CAST WHO DON'T GET A CHOMP AT THAT.  NO, IT'S DONE WELL. I WAS THERE WHEN THEY HAD LARRY DAVID COME IN FOR BERNIE SANDERS, AND IT'S ALWAYS WITHIN SORT OF THE FAMILY OF COMEDY AND PEOPLE THAT WE RESPECT. SO I THINK IT'S MORE THAN ANYTHING JUST AS EXCITING FOR US. I MEAN, MELISSA WAS THE PERSON, I CAME FROM THE THEATER IN LOS ANGELES AND SHE DID AS WELL, AND MELISSA WAS THE PERSON WHO I WOULD GO OUT OF THE WAY TO SEE.  Stephen: SHE'S EXTRAORDINARY.  SHE'S A GENIUS.  Stephen: DID YOU EVER DO SCHWARZENEGGER?  I DIDN'T DO HIM ON THE SHOW BUT DIRECTED HIM IN A MOVIE THIS PAST SUMMER WHICH WAS VERY COOL, VERY EXCITING FOR ME. I DIRECTED A FILM WHY ARE WE KILLING DON'TER, A MOCKMENTRY ABOUT CONTRACT KILLERS TRYING TO KILL THE MOST FAMOUS HIT MAN TO USURP THE KING AND WE GOT ARNOLD TO BE GUNTHER, SPOILER ALERT. IT WAS CRAZY BECAUSE I FACETIMEED WITH HIM. MY ASSISTANT SAID I'M GOING TO HAND YOU TO ARNOLD NOW, HE WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF A SIX FOOT DESK, SMOKING CIGAR BEHIND A PICTURE FROM HIS PUMPING IRON DAYS. HE SAID, HELLO, TARAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU! THIS WAS THE BEFORE, THIS THIS I AFTER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: TARAN KILLAM, ON BROAD WAY AT THE RICHARD RODGERS THEATRE! STICK AROUND! RAE SREMMURD NEXT!-From the first film, we know that you are sort of the cooler of the two dads. -Yeah. -You and Will -- I think it comes across in the clip, as well. What about -- You have children. You had a premiere for the film. Do they think it´s cool that their dad is Mark Wahlberg? Did they come to the premiere? -They did not come to the premiere. -Really? -They basically refused to come to the premiere. -Why -- Why did they refuse? -They were like, "Dad, we´ll see it whenever we see it." I´m like, "Come on, everybody is going to be there. Will´s going to be there. John Cena is going to be there." They had no interest. And, of course, Will shows up with his wife and the kids and they´re all in suits and dressed up and -- But, you know, they just didn´t want to go. The boys were watching football. My daughter is on the phone, doing her thing. -Do they just -- Do you think it´s that they aged out of their dad being cool? Do you think your heyday of being a cool dad is over? -It´s been over. -Okay. -You know, so now I´m like, I don´t make a point to embarrass them, but I´m not going to try to hide my affection for them either. So, they´re like, "Dad, drop us off in the alley at the school." And I´m like "No. I´m going to walk you in. I´m getting a kiss in front of all your friends. And that´s it." But, if they need something, if they want to meet Drake, or they want somebody that, you know, they know Dad knows or can hookup... -Yeah. -...then they´ll say, "Oh, yeah Dad, we think you´re cool for five minutes." -Gotcha. [ Laughter ] So they´re not smart enough, if they want to meet Drake, to, like, be nice for a week leading up to the ask? They just -- -For a week? No. They´ll be nice for five minutes. If they don´t get what they want, when they want, they´re just right back to not talking to me or just, you know, being, you know, kids. But, you know, they´re kids, so I understand. -I´m not that -- My son is a year and a half, and he´s just super. I think he thinks I´m the coolest dude he´s ever met ´cause he´s only met like six dudes. [ Laughter ] -Enjoy it while it lasts. -Yeah, I´m going to. -And more importantly, be grateful that it´s not a girl. And, now, mind you, the best relationship that I have with my daughter -- Daddy/daughter relationship is great, but when they become teenagers, something happens. You have no idea what to do about it, how to handle it. The hormones, the emotions. It´s absolute torture, so -- I mean, watch out. -That´s really sweet. [ Laughter ] -Yeah, it´s sweet until it happens to you. And like I said, we´re cool. But you know what? The whole thing with the boys and all of this stuff, I´m just not ready for it. -Yeah, I gotcha. So, I want to ask about this because Will was here yesterday and I didn´t have a chance to ask him about it. But your assistant -- Did your assistant get a part in the film in the end? -He got a part in the end, but he got cut. -Oh, he got cut. -Yeah, and he only auditioned for like one line. One word, really. -Okay. He´s yelling one word in the audience of the -- the improv club. But we made him audition to Tim Hutton´s most emotional scenes in "Ordinary People." -[ Laughs ] So wait -- -And he spent weeks and weeks and weeks studying these scenes, learning the lines. Like, he emoted in front of me and Will and Chris Henchy for like -- -So you made him audition in front -- He didn´t have to audition. He auditioned for you and Will and Chris Henchy. -We are the producers of the film. We basically said, "Yes. You have to do this." And you know what? He did a good job. But then they -- he didn´t -- he did a good job in the audition, but maybe didn´t do a good job in the actual scene. -Yeah, so you had to -- -So the scene got cut. What can I do? But I told Tim Hutton. Tim Hutton and I worked on a movie after that, and I told him, and Tim really wanted to see the footage. -Oh, really? Did you show -- -I didn´t get it in time. And I don´t think he would have -- I think at first he thought we were paying homage, but then I think I realized that he might not have liked it after he saw it. -Wasn´t quite up to Tim´s standards. -Right, exactly. -Won an Oscar for that part. -He did win an Oscar for that part. I forgot that. Now, I also heard that -- so Will -- John Lithgow plays Will´s father. -Uh-huh. -And they have a fight scene. And you encourage them not just to go for it when you were shooting it, but to like actually physically go for it in rehearsal. -John is a method guy. Will is -- You know how Will -- -Yeah. -He´s a such sweet guy, right? So he doesn´t want to say anything to John. So, like, you know, when they had to do the first big, long, awkward kiss, right, I´m like, "Oh, that was really good. You guys got to do that again." And then I keep telling John, "Do it more often." Then John is doing it at rehearsals, he´s doing it when they´re just blocking the scene. And Will would never say anything, but I could tell he was getting annoyed. So I would start, you know -- It was giving me great pleasure. [ Laughter ] And then when they started doing the fight scene, you know, John was just, like, putting him in a headlock. And you could tell Will -- ´cause, like, we did 15 takes of the first scene where I had to give him a heart pump and try to revive him. And he didn´t say anything until, like, I almost caved his chest in. He was like, "Maybe now that you got the hard one in, you do one of those soft ones. You probably have a soft one in you." So I´m like, "Okay." So, and then John was just torturing him. It was a lot of fun.-Thank you for coming back, because I love having you on. I really do. I want to go -- -I love being here. [ Laughter ] I saw the 15-minute segment you did... [ Laughter ] -What are you talking about? -...making fun of my damn album cover. -I didn't make -- I'm not making fun of it. -Can you try to help me sell records for once? Can you do something that promotes me? -What is the situation? Are you, like, thinking about what to do with the boat? [ Laughter ] Like, what -- what -- what are you thinking here? About memories of where you are? Is this Texoma Shore? -Right now, I'm -- I'm thinking about wishing I was there. [ Laughter ] -I know, I know! But are you here now? Is this photo of Texoma Shore? -Of course it is. That's the Texoma Shore. -But what are you thinking about? Some other place? [ Laughter ] Or memories of growing up, Texoma Shore, young little Blakey? [ Laughter ] Running around with his short-shorts on. [ Laughter ] "Ma, pa, I'm here! Am I late for dinner?" "Naw, don't worry about it, Blake. We're having the same thing we have every night." [ Laughter ] "Get over here, Blake. Get in here. And get me a whiskey!" "What's your problem, Dad? You never loved me." [ Laughter ] "Yeah, I do! I love you right now. Get over here, son." "Come here, Blakey." "I love you, Ma. I love you, Dad." [ Laughter ] Like, that type of thing. Is that the type of... [ Laughter and applause ] ...situation. [ Laughing ] Texoma Shore is a real place. I did not know that. -It's Lake Texoma in Oklahoma. Come on, man. -[ Woman cheers ] -Yeah, see? -Two people cheered. [ Laughter ] -What are you talking about? -What am I talking about. I never -- I really never heard of this. This is -- -Lake Texoma. So, it's the border of Oklahoma and Texas -- Lake Tex...oma. -Well, I get it now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought maybe you made it up and made up a word or something. [ Laughter ] You're an artist. -That's true. -You do things like that. You know, you make up words and stuff like that. -Would you interview me, for God sakes? [ Laughter ] -Let's talk about this. You're going on a tour. -Thank God. -Yeah, all right. You're going on tour. -Let's talk about it. -Yeah. Brett Eldridge. I love Brett Eldridge. Trace Adkins. -You know, Trace Adkins? -That's my dude. -Yeah. -Yeah. -He's taller than you, huh? -Little bit. -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -And Carly Pearce. -Carly Pearce is a new -- -Shorter than you. -New girl coming out in country music. -Yeah. -Got a huge hit out there. -Now, you can go to BlakeShelton.com, which I do every day. -Of course. [ Laughter ] -I just click refresh on my computer just to see what you're up to, man. -You do? [ Laughter ] -Yeah, BlakeShelton.com. So you write recipes and stuff like that. -Yeah. -You know, Pinterest pages. How to decorate your dorm room and stuff. [ Laughter ] I love your website. I'm always on your website. I know that you have a restaurant called Old Red. -Mm-hmm. -You do, for real. You opened a restaurant. -That's -- -Yeah. -You're teeing me up here now. [ Laughter ] -No, I've never been there. -You don't ask a question like a normal interviewer. Ask me a question. You just say it, and I didn't even get a chance to say it. -Old Red is the name of the restaurant. -Old Red is the name of the new restaurant in -- -The new restaurant is called Old Red. -This is unbelievable. Even the band -- -Well, it's just an ironic name for a new restaurant. "Here it is -- Old -- Here's an old new restaurant." [ Laughter ] Already my mind is boggled. I go in. I don't know what to expect. What do I go in when I go into Old Red? -Old Red is the new restaurant/bar music venue that is in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. I know you've heard of -- No. I know you've heard of Tishomingo. -I don't know if you're trying to catch me or something. -I've talked about it on this show. -Yeah. I've always listened. -This show. -Yeah, I always listen to you. -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -Tishomingo. That's where you live. -Yes. -You have a house there. And do you have a boat? [ Laughter ] Just setting you up, because Texoma Shore... How far away are you from the shore? [ Laughter ] How far away are you from -- -I'm not going to give you the location of my damn house. [ Laughter ] -Just have the Google digits. -Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. -What do you know about running a restaurant? Why would you do something like this? [ Laughter ] -What do you know about having a restaurant? -I would never run a restaurant. -You never had a restaurant. -No. No. I think I might have maybe almost invested in one and... -Just didn't. -Well, it's a bad investment. I mean, they -- it's -- [ Laughter ] I'm just saying -- No, I mean, it's really hard to run and maintain restaurants. I mean, I don't know why you would do this. [ Laughter ] But I hope it's a hit. I mean, in a -- [ Laughter ] People -- Everyone in Tishiwanga should go to, uh... [ Laughter ] ...Old Red. You know? You go in, you go, "I want the usual." [ Laughter ] Is it burgers and stuff and wings? [ Laughter ] I go into Old Red, right? -Yeah. -I've never been there before. What do I see? I walk in. What do I see? -You see tables. You see a bar. -Uh-huh. You see a -- There's a stage back there. -Is there, really? -Yeah. -Live music? -Of course. -Well, that's fantastic. -Yeah. -I didn't know that. I thought it was a restaurant. I thought it was like an Olive Garden. [ Laughter ] -Because you're opening another one, I hear. -Another Old Red, yes. In Nashville. -In Nashville. Old Red -- When you're here, you're family. [ Laughter ] -You made up a slogan for us. -Yeah. -I like it. -Where are you gonna open it? -In Nashville, Tennessee. [ Laughter ] -Yeah. I'd like to check it out. -Did I say that wrong? Did I say Nashville -- -No, I've heard of Nashville. It's great. I'm sure I've heard of the other location. [ Laughter ] But I'm excited for you. And I can tell that you're excited. -Can we play a game or something? -No, no, Blake, no, this -- [ Laughter and applause ] -Can we do karaoke? -Let's talk about -- No. -What about karaoke? -Let's talk about "Texoma Shore." "Texoma Shore" -- This is out this Friday. So you can preorder it now. You go to BlakeShelton.com. Or you go to probably Apple. [ Laughter ] Apple probably has it. iTunes has it. You know what? I want to talk about "The Voice." -Okay. [ Laughter ] 'Cause this is an interview, and I am doing a -- -You did a great job. -Thank you very much. -Great job. [ Laughter ] Who's a special guest coming up? Kelly Clarkson. -Kelly Clarkson, who's gonna be a coach next season. -I love Kelly Clarkson. She's great. -Me too. I do, too. She's been a friend for a long time. -Is that right? -Yeah. I think I met her, like, right after she won "American Idol." -Did you really? -She knows a thing or two about those singing shows. So she'd be great -- a great, uh... -She'll be fun to beat. [ Laughter ] -So you're going up against her? -Yeah, when she's a coach next season, I'm gonna be going up against her. -Oh, no. -Do you hear anything I say to you? -No. -No? -I have a clip. [ Laughter ] Here's Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson in an early look at next Monday's episode of "The Voice." -You've been drinking already, haven't you? -Check this out. -A little bit. So, before you beat me next year, will you help me this year? -Yeah. -Okay. -I don't think you're gonna beat me. -Are you serious? -Here's why. I think you're going to pass out during the blind auditions 'cause you can't stop talking... -Yeah. -...long enough to breathe. -This is a -- -So you'll be in the middle of a pitch, literally face first on your buzzer. -Nope. -Is it possible that you talk more than Miley? -[ Laughing ] [ Cheers and applause ] -She's coming on the show... Let's talk about "Texoma Shore." -Sure. -These are some of the songs on here. -Okay. -What are you -- ""You're Turning Me On." [ Laughter ] -That's a song on there, yes. -Yes. [ Laughter ] -You think I was just saying that? [ Laughter ] "Turning Me On" is there. You got "Money." You got... "At The House" you're doing today. -Yes. -That's the song you're doing tonight. -Doing that tonight, right here, on your show. -"At The House." And we're psyched that you're doing that. -"At The House." -I love that. [ Cheers and applause ] -That's one of my favorite songs on the album. -Is it? -I love that. -What else do you like? ♪ At the house in the middle of the street ♪ ♪ The house ♪ ♪ In the middle of the creek ♪ ♪ The house ♪ ♪ In the middle of the creek ♪ ♪ At Texoma Shore, that was where we used to meet ♪ [ Cheers and applause ] Great song.

You make me feel like Super Dave Osborne when I'm on this damn show. -That's a good thing. Yeah, like a superhero. Uh, yeah. No, I like that. I like -- "I'll Name the Dogs" is a big hit. I like that song. -Will you sing a little bit of that for us? [ Laughter ] ♪ I'll name the dog ♪ ♪ I'll name him Spotty and Rex ♪ ♪ I have never had sex ♪ Something like that. -Yeah. -That's a good song. That's a Blake Shelton song. -Mm-hmm.

When I hear that, it makes me just want to kick back and go, like, back to Texoma Shore. -Yeah. You look good in that hat, by the way. Don't y'all think he looks good in that hat? You look good in that hat. [ Cheers and applause ] -I look like somebody. Who do I look like? -You look a little like Woody from "Toy Story." [ Cheers and applause ]-I want to ask about this. Because, um, do you have a scuba background? Because you went to an opening of an aquarium in Missouri? -Yes. Yeah, Johnny Morris opened this beautiful wildlife museum. Johhny Morris is the founder of Bass Pro Shop. -Uh-huh. -And all of a sudden, George Bush was there, Jimmy Carter. They´re like, "oh, you want to get in the shark tank?" I´m like, "no, I don´t want to get in the shark tank." They´re like, "no, no, no, it would be really cool. Get in the shark tank with the stingrays and everything else." Next thing you know, I´m diving in this tank. I mean, I literally just showed up to say hello. -Uh-huh. -To show my support for the opening of the museum. -And there you are. That´s, I guess, a little stingray, right? -Yeah. -Although, I don´t mean to say little. If I saw that, I´d be terrified. -That´s how that guy Steve Irwin died. -Yeah. -He got stabbed by a stingray. -I don´t think in, like, an aquarium, though. [ Laughter ] -You know what? I don´t think they´re, like, really trainable animals, either. You know, like, "hey, this one´s not a stinger." That´s a stinger right there, that thing on the back. Yeah, that´s the little thing that -- -No, I think they have to go through a really -- a long training before they let them in the aquarium. -Well, anyway, I went there. We´re trying to persuade these guys to do this Wahlburger partnership, open restaurants in these Bass Pro Shops. ´cause people go there for, like, six hours, and they´re like, "yeah, we´re really into the idea." But now we´re in a tank, and we still don´t have a Wahlburgers in a Bass Pro Shop. [ Laughter ] -Oh, so this was -- you saw this as a business opportunity, and it totally backfired. -You see what I do to support my brand? Uh, yeah. And didn´t work out quite the way I had hoped, so... -And was it -- did it increase the pressure to have two ex-presidents watch you get into a scuba tank? -Oh, they´re all sitting there just having hors d´oeuvres and cocktails and looking... Basically paying no attention to me whatsoever -- -Well, I guess that´s the thing is -- -And you can´t really see out. -Yeah. -You know? And I´m like, "I´ve got to go somewhere else the same day." -Yeah. -And, like, people just kind of left me. There was one other diver. And they were just, like, doing these signals. -[ Laughs ] -And I´m like, "I don´t know scuba signals." -Also, you can barely tell it´s you. So it´s not that exciting to watch if someone´s like, "ladies and gentlemen, Mark Wahlberg." You´d be like, "that could be anybody." -Exactly. -You do get a -- which is very surprising to me, because you´ve been doing this so long and you´re so recognizable. But you do get mistaken for one actor more than other actors. -Yes. -You want to tell us who it is? -My fellow Bostonian Matt Damon. -Yeah. -And by the way, your clip about all the Boston movies... -Oh... -Was one of the funniest things I´ve ever seen. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. -Much better Boston accent than most of the people in Boston, by the way, so thank you for that. -Yes, I don´t think I´m top tier, but I do think I´m better than bottom. -No, it´s -- it´s pretty high. -Yeah. -It´s pretty high. So anyway, yeah, he gets recognized, you know, for me and I get recognized for him. But I never tell people. I never correct anybody. Somebody comes up and says, "hey, I loved you in ´The Bourne.´" I´m like, "thank you. I got another one coming out soon." And I just keep going. [ Cheers and applause ] It´s like, I start explaining -- -Yeah. -I didn´t want to apologize. -Yeah. -They think I´m offended. I´m not offended at all. Not a problem, thank you very much. -[ Laughs ] -I´ll see you later. -You shot some of this movie, "Daddy´s Home 2," in Boston. -Yes. -Is it exciting for you to shoot in Boston? -No. -Okay. -Well, like, random people showing up unannounced and uninvited. No. -Oh, right, ´cause you have such... -But every -- yeah, I have a long history there. You know, it´s nice to be able to see my mom and stuff. But, you know, like, everybody´s like, "oh, I love Boston!" Everybody who, like, went to school to Boston or spent a little time, spent the summer in Nantucket or on the cape, they love it. You know, if you´ve been there, you know, there´s a reason why you wanna -- I mean, I love going back. And I appreciate that I can go back. But I have people from my past, some of them kind of sketchy that´ll show up unannounced. Like, my friends were, like, plotting to steal camera equipment before on "The Perfect Storm." And they were like, "wow, that thing looks expensive." I´m like, "yeah, it´s like $250,000." They´re like, "oh, let´s put it in the trunk." [ Laughter ] I´m like, "who are you going to "sell a Panovision camera to? You´re going to sell it to "George at the store for 500 bucks "and a free -- free pizza? He´s not gonna be able to use it. They´re gonna -- they´re gonna catch you." -I didn´t think of it that way. That makes a lot of sense. Hey, it´s always great to see you. Congrats on the film. It´s a pleasure. -Thanks for having me.-Thank you so much for being here! -Yeah, my pleasure! -And I want you -- I owe you extra thanks. -Okay. -We had you booked first, and then we actually had to ask you would you be willing to be a second guest to Hillary Rodham Clinton and you said, "Yeah." -I´m not the first guest? [ Laughter ] -No, Hillary Rodham Clinton was just out here, yeah. -Hillary? An impersonator? -No, no. We had the real -- The real Hillary, yeah. -Was on. -Yeah. -Just minutes ago? -Just right before you, yeah. -Why am I even out here? -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -Yeah. -I mean, I think it´s still, you know, we can get across -- -Oh,. Wow, Hillary? -Yeah. -Was sitting here? -What were you watching in your dressing room? -I was playing Sega Genesis. [ Laughter ] Yeah. -The very old. -The very old Sega. -We don´t have one. Did you bring -- -I have a pocket Sega Genesis I bring... -Oh, gotcha. Oh, gosh, yeah. -...with me. -Well, you missed Hillary Rodham Clinton. How´d you do? Were you doing well? -I was playing -- What was I -- I was playing "Centipede." Yeah, yeah. -Gotcha, wow! -On Sega Genesis. -Oh, wow. -Oh, so I´m the second guest? -Yeah. -That´s -- that´s still good. -Yeah! [ Cheers and applause ] -Because it´s -- It´s 1:18 in the morning. Yeah. -Yeah, it´s a little late now. -I couldn´t figure out why it was so late. -Yeah, it´s really late. -And I´m like, "They´ll knock on my door at some point." -Yeah. And that´s the thing -- Well, you say, like, time doesn´t move. -By the way, this is Sega Genesis, just so those at home, if you´re just tuning on right at this moment, people will know. [ Laughter ] You might want to do a lower third. -A very small one. Yeah, we´ll put Sega Genesis there. And then hopefully, they´ll send you some free stuff if we get a Sega. -Ooh! [ Laughter ] -So you shot "Daddy´s Home 2" in Boston. -I did. Yeah, we did. -And you were staying at the hotel when the Celtics were in the playoffs last year. -Right. -Every team that the Celtics played in the playoffs would come through. -Would stay at the Ritz-Carlton that I was staying at, and I would run into the players, occasionally. One time I ran into some of the Washington Wizards, who then said, "Wait, you got to come with me." Took me into a room which was two adjoining rooms and was their impromptu training area. -Oh, they were playing basketball inside? -No, no, no. They were giving people massages. Not the players, the training staff. -Okay. This is getting very shady. Are you sure it was the Wizards? [ Laughter ] Are you sure these people played for a basketball team? -Yeah, the wizards. They were six Asian guys. They call themselves the Wizards. [ Laughter ] -It was not -- I think you walked into a -- -I was in the South end of Boston. -Okay, so you walked out of the Ritz-Carlton. -Yeah, I was out of the -- -Okay, yeah, I don´t think that was a basketball team. -Okay. Well, I did, however -- okay, here´s the true part of this story. [ Laughter ] This is the best part right here. So, this -- the teams would stay at this hotel, ´cause they also had a -- it was connected to an Equinox gym. Hope I get an Equinox pass for that. Sega Genesis. Lifetime membership to Equinox. -Oh, a lifetime? Yeah. -So, they had a gym there, so the teams would stay in that hotel ´cause they could do their pregame workout. -Mm-hmm. -And the Cavaliers were there. And I´m, you know, lifting weights... -Yeah. -...using the Universal weight system. [ Laughter and applause ] Love to get some Universal weights. And I see Lebron James. -All right, that´s pretty good. -So, I´ve -- I don´t usually bother people. I kind of know Kevin Love a little bit. -Uh-huh. UCLA, right? -I said hi to Kevin. UCLA. I said hi him, and then I went over to Lebron. I´m like, "I just have to say hello. How are you?" And I just said, "I was just telling my wife the other night that you need to run for President. -Mm-hmm. -You´re from the Midwest. -Yep. -You´re very famous. You´re very popular. You´re very articulate. Please run for office." So, Lebron. [ Laughter ] -Doubled down. -I´m telling you now, we need you. [ Cheers and applause ] And I would love some of your shoes. -Oh, my God. Really? Can this be -- You just have one genuine thing without it being about getting free stuff. -I´ve got four things coming my way, so yeah. -I think, at best, you´re going to get one or two. Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME STEVE CARELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LOOK AT YOU!  Stephen: LOOK AT YOU!  OH MY GOD.  Stephen: MR. MOVIE STAR. IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU.  GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO, STEPHEN.  Stephen: WELL, WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY, BABY. WE STARTED OFF AT 2nd CITY TOGETHER.  YEAH.  Stephen: YEAH. IN CHICAGO AN IMPROVISATIONAL THEATER. WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR MEMORIES OF THAT TIME, LATE '80S AND EARLY 90s. WE WERING TO. ANY MEMORIES OF SECOND CITY, LIKE OUR TIMING TO BACK THERE?  I ALWAYS-- WELL, YOU UNDERSTUDIED ME, THE FIRST NAME MAIN STAGE SHOW SCZ FIRST TIME I WENT.  I PLAYED THE BAR I TONE HORN.  Stephen: YEAH.  AND YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE BAR I TONE HORN.  Stephen: SECOND CITY SAY REP SYSTEM, ANYBODY IN THE TOURING COMPANY, YOU GOT HIRED ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE I DID. AND THE TOURING COMPANY HAS TO GO IN FOR WHOEVER IS ON MAIN STAGE, LIKE YOU HAD TO GO IN FOR THE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU. BUT THE PART YOU WERE DOING, YOU PLAYED A BAR I TONE HORN, A FAT TRUM BET ---- TRUM PET.  YEAH.  Stephen: I NEVER PLAYED A BRASS INSTRUMENT AND THEY SAID ARE YOU ON NOR CARELL IN SIX DAYS, LEARN TO PLAY THE BARITONE HORN.  IT IS INCREDIBLE.  Stephen: YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING ON THE BARITONE HORN.  NOT SO MUCH BUT HAVING NEVER PLAYED IT, IN SIX DAYS.  Stephen: AND I HAD MY OWN BARITONE HORN BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T EVEN RENT ME THE HORN. I LEARNED IT IN SIX DAYS AND MY LIPS WERE JUST LIKE A BABOON'S ASS BECAUSE I HAD NO OMBU CHER. THE ONE THING I REMEMBERED, IT DRILLED IN MY HEAD, I WANTED THE GILG SO BADLY THAT I-- THE ANCHORS AWAY. CAN I NO LONGER HEAR ANCHORS AWAY, I CAN ONLY HEAR THE-BASE LINE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU PLAY. DO YOU REMEMBER IT.  YEAH.  Stephen: BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA ♪ ♪ ♪ BA, BA, BA ♪ ♪ BA, BA ♪ ♪ BA, BA, BA ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).  Stephen: WHAT, THAT WAS 1990.  YEAH.  Stephen: 25 YEARS AGO. THAT IS HOW EMOTIONALLY SCARRING THAT WEEK WAS FOR ME.  BUT EVERY TIME YOU HEAR THAT SONG, IT'S THE ONLY PART YOU CAN HEAR.  Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.  SO WE DID COMEDYING TO FOR YEARS, YOU AND I DID THAT TOGETHER. THEN WE DID, THE DANA CARVY SHOW TOGETHER. WE WERE OFFICE MATE THERE.  UH-HUH.  Stephen: OFFICE MATES AT THE DAILY SHOW FOREVER.  YUP.  Stephen: YOU ARE POUND FOR POUND ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO DRAMA, MAN? YOU'RE HURTING OUR FEELINGS.  I FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME TO HAVE SOME PRETENSE IN MY LIFE.  Stephen: OKAY. HAVE YOU TRIED NOT PRONOUNCING THE LAST CONSONANT OF YOUR LAST NAME? THAT'S HOW I GET MINE IN.  I LIKE IT.  Stephen: YEAH. BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE TREMENDOUS WORK. OBVIOUSLY I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO IT, BECAUSE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. PEOPLE ASK ME, LIKE WOW, IN "FOX CATCHER" HE WAS REALLY SCARY, I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. I SAID NO, I ALWAYS KNEW HE COULD PLAY A PSYCHOTIC.  I APPRECIATE THAT.  Stephen: YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.  WELL, I MEAN, RIGHT BACK AT YOU, THOUGH. THERE IS NO ONE-- SERIOUSLY, THERE IS NO ONE I WOULD RATHER PERFORM WITH THAN YOU.  Stephen: REALLY?  SERIOUSLY.  Stephen: REALLY.  TO BE ON-- BUT IT'S TRUE.  Stephen: WE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS.  CUZ I ALWAYS KNEW, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS, WE'RE ALWAYS FUNNY TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER).  Stephen: I WILL TRY MY DRAMATIC CHOPS BE YOU RIGHT NOW.  YOU'RE ALWAYS SO ON POINT AND SO GREAT AND YOU CAN-- I DON'T KNOW. EVERYONE'S BORED WITH US. (LAUGHTER).  Stephen: BUT I'M ENJOYING THIS CONVERSATION.  I AM TOO.  Stephen: THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. LET'S TALK ABOUT "THE BIG SHORT" FOR A SECOND. I'M FASCINATED BY THIS MOVIE. I LOVE THE IDEA OF THIS MOVIE. SO YOU PLAY A GUY, LET ME GET THIS, MARK BALM, ALL RIGHT, BASED ON A REAL HEDGE FUND MANAGER NAMED STEVE EISMAN, BEFORE THE 2008 CRASH.  UH-HUH.  Stephen: HE SEES SOMETHING COMING. WHAT DOES HE SEE COMING?  HE SAW THE BUBBLE. HE SAW THE HOUSING BUBBLE. HE SAW THAT ALL OF THESE MORTGAGES WERE GOING TO DEFAULT AND HE AND A-- .  Stephen: A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE SAW IT WITH HIM.  A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE SAW IT COMING AND ESSENTIALLY BET AGAINST THE U.S. ECONOMY.  Stephen: AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT THEY WERE CRAZY.  EVERYONE THOUGHT IT THEY WERE CRAZY AND IT'S WEIRD WATCHING THE MOVIE. YOU THINK WHO ARE THE HEROES HERE. BECAUSE YOU KIND OF ROOT FOR THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA.  Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT IF THE HEROES OF OUR MOVIE ACTUALLY GET WHAT THEY WANT, ACTUAL OF US LOSE.  EXACTLY. AND YOU STILL KIND OF ROOT FOR IT.  Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE WALKING AROUND ON THE MOVIE, THIS IS-- WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE MOVIE, WHAT TERRIFIED ME WAS, I HAD FORGOT ENHOW CLOSE WE CAME TO A GLOBAL MELTDOWN. LIKE $17 TRILLION DISAPPEARED OVERNIGHT BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.  IT, WELL, AND HAD THE GOVERNMENT NOT BAILED OUT THE BANKS, WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED THERE. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE TIME. YOU KNOW, YOU READ THE PAPER AND YOU WATCH THE NEWS. BUT THE EXTENT OF IT, I HAD NO IDEA.  Stephen: SO YOU DID NOT-- YOU DON'T REALLY DEEPLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS.  ANYTHING.  Stephen: ANYTHING, RIGHT. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT, THAT THAT IS A VERY ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF WALL STREET IN 2008.  THANK YOU.  Stephen: REALLY GOOD WORK. REALLY GOOD WORK. (APPLAUSE) AND THE MOVIE IS WITH ADAM McKAY, WHO "ANCHORMAN" ONE AND TWO. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF DOING "ANCHORMAN" WITH HIM AND DOING A DRAMA ABOUT THE WORLDWIDE COLLAPSE OF OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM.  IT'S ACTUALLY CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD THINK. BECAUSE ADAM, WHEN WE WERE DOING "ANCHORMAN" HE IS THE FUNNIEST GUY, HE SITS BEHIND A MONITER WITH A MICROPHONE AND SHOUTS OUT THINGS LIKE, I POOPED A DHOK LAT SCWIREL. AND YOU SAY THAT, NOT IN THIS MOVIE AND THE BUT THE OTHER MOVIE. AND YOU JUST SAY THINGS THAT HE SAYS. AND HE'S INCREDIBLY SMART AND FUNNY. FOR THIS MOVIE, HE STILL HAD HIS MIC BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.  Stephen: HE'S LIKE GO, IMPROVISE ABOUT, YOU KNOW.  DERIFF TIFFS AND.  YEAH, AND YOU WOULD TRY TO HAVE SOME THINGS IN YOUR BACK POCKET THAT YOU COULD THEN IMPROVISE ON.  Stephen: COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS, MAKE IT EXCITING, GO.  EXACTLY, EXACTLY.-Thank you for coming back, because I love having you on. I really do. I want to go -- -I love being here. [ Laughter ] I saw the 15-minute segment you did... [ Laughter ] -What are you talking about? -...making fun of my damn album cover. -I didn't make -- I'm not making fun of it. -Can you try to help me sell records for once? Can you do something that promotes me? -What is the situation? Are you, like, thinking about what to do with the boat? [ Laughter ] Like, what -- what -- what are you thinking here? About memories of where you are? Is this Texoma Shore? -Right now, I'm -- I'm thinking about wishing I was there. [ Laughter ] -I know, I know! But are you here now? Is this photo of Texoma Shore? -Of course it is. That's the Texoma Shore. -But what are you thinking about? Some other place? [ Laughter ] Or memories of growing up, Texoma Shore, young little Blakey? [ Laughter ] Running around with his short-shorts on. [ Laughter ] "Ma, pa, I'm here! Am I late for dinner?" "Naw, don't worry about it, Blake. We're having the same thing we have every night." [ Laughter ] "Get over here, Blake. Get in here. And get me a whiskey!" "What's your problem, Dad? You never loved me." [ Laughter ] "Yeah, I do! I love you right now. Get over here, son." "Come here, Blakey." "I love you, Ma. I love you, Dad." [ Laughter ] Like, that type of thing. Is that the type of... [ Laughter and applause ] ...situation. [ Laughing ] Texoma Shore is a real place. I did not know that. -It's Lake Texoma in Oklahoma. Come on, man. -[ Woman cheers ] -Yeah, see? -Two people cheered. [ Laughter ] -What are you talking about? -What am I talking about. I never -- I really never heard of this. This is -- -Lake Texoma. So, it's the border of Oklahoma and Texas -- Lake Tex...oma. -Well, I get it now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought maybe you made it up and made up a word or something. [ Laughter ] You're an artist. -That's true. -You do things like that. You know, you make up words and stuff like that. -Would you interview me, for God sakes? [ Laughter ] -Let's talk about this. You're going on a tour. -Thank God. -Yeah, all right. You're going on tour. -Let's talk about it. -Yeah. Brett Eldridge. I love Brett Eldridge. Trace Adkins. -You know, Trace Adkins? -That's my dude. -Yeah. -Yeah. -He's taller than you, huh? -Little bit. -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -And Carly Pearce. -Carly Pearce is a new -- -Shorter than you. -New girl coming out in country music. -Yeah. -Got a huge hit out there. -Now, you can go to BlakeShelton.com, which I do every day. -Of course. [ Laughter ] -I just click refresh on my computer just to see what you're up to, man. -You do? [ Laughter ] -Yeah, BlakeShelton.com. So you write recipes and stuff like that. -Yeah. -You know, Pinterest pages. How to decorate your dorm room and stuff. [ Laughter ] I love your website. I'm always on your website. I know that you have a restaurant called Old Red. -Mm-hmm. -You do, for real. You opened a restaurant. -That's -- -Yeah. -You're teeing me up here now. [ Laughter ] -No, I've never been there. -You don't ask a question like a normal interviewer. Ask me a question. You just say it, and I didn't even get a chance to say it. -Old Red is the name of the restaurant. -Old Red is the name of the new restaurant in -- -The new restaurant is called Old Red. -This is unbelievable. Even the band -- -Well, it's just an ironic name for a new restaurant. "Here it is -- Old -- Here's an old new restaurant." [ Laughter ] Already my mind is boggled. I go in. I don't know what to expect. What do I go in when I go into Old Red? -Old Red is the new restaurant/bar music venue that is in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. I know you've heard of -- No. I know you've heard of Tishomingo. -I don't know if you're trying to catch me or something. -I've talked about it on this show. -Yeah. I've always listened. -This show. -Yeah, I always listen to you. -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -Tishomingo. That's where you live. -Yes. -You have a house there. And do you have a boat? [ Laughter ] Just setting you up, because Texoma Shore... How far away are you from the shore? [ Laughter ] How far away are you from -- -I'm not going to give you the location of my damn house. [ Laughter ] -Just have the Google digits. -Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. -What do you know about running a restaurant? Why would you do something like this? [ Laughter ] -What do you know about having a restaurant? -I would never run a restaurant. -You never had a restaurant. -No. No. I think I might have maybe almost invested in one and... -Just didn't. -Well, it's a bad investment. I mean, they -- it's -- [ Laughter ] I'm just saying -- No, I mean, it's really hard to run and maintain restaurants. I mean, I don't know why you would do this. [ Laughter ] But I hope it's a hit. I mean, in a -- [ Laughter ] People -- Everyone in Tishiwanga should go to, uh... [ Laughter ] ...Old Red. You know? You go in, you go, "I want the usual." [ Laughter ] Is it burgers and stuff and wings? [ Laughter ] I go into Old Red, right? -Yeah. -I've never been there before. What do I see? I walk in. What do I see? -You see tables. You see a bar. -Uh-huh. You see a -- There's a stage back there. -Is there, really? -Yeah. -Live music? -Of course. -Well, that's fantastic. -Yeah. -I didn't know that. I thought it was a restaurant. I thought it was like an Olive Garden. [ Laughter ] -Because you're opening another one, I hear. -Another Old Red, yes. In Nashville. -In Nashville. Old Red -- When you're here, you're family. [ Laughter ] -You made up a slogan for us. -Yeah. -I like it. -Where are you gonna open it? -In Nashville, Tennessee. [ Laughter ] -Yeah. I'd like to check it out. -Did I say that wrong? Did I say Nashville -- -No, I've heard of Nashville. It's great. I'm sure I've heard of the other location. [ Laughter ] But I'm excited for you. And I can tell that you're excited. -Can we play a game or something? -No, no, Blake, no, this -- [ Laughter and applause ] -Can we do karaoke? -Let's talk about -- No. -What about karaoke? -Let's talk about "Texoma Shore." "Texoma Shore" -- This is out this Friday. So you can preorder it now. You go to BlakeShelton.com. Or you go to probably Apple. [ Laughter ] Apple probably has it. iTunes has it. You know what? I want to talk about "The Voice." -Okay. [ Laughter ] 'Cause this is an interview, and I am doing a -- -You did a great job. -Thank you very much. -Great job. [ Laughter ] Who's a special guest coming up? Kelly Clarkson. -Kelly Clarkson, who's gonna be a coach next season. -I love Kelly Clarkson. She's great. -Me too. I do, too. She's been a friend for a long time. -Is that right? -Yeah. I think I met her, like, right after she won "American Idol." -Did you really? -She knows a thing or two about those singing shows. So she'd be great -- a great, uh... -She'll be fun to beat. [ Laughter ] -So you're going up against her? -Yeah, when she's a coach next season, I'm gonna be going up against her. -Oh, no. -Do you hear anything I say to you? -No. -No? -I have a clip. [ Laughter ] Here's Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson in an early look at next Monday's episode of "The Voice." -You've been drinking already, haven't you? -Check this out. -A little bit. So, before you beat me next year, will you help me this year? -Yeah. -Okay. -I don't think you're gonna beat me. -Are you serious? -Here's why. I think you're going to pass out during the blind auditions 'cause you can't stop talking... -Yeah. -...long enough to breathe. -This is a -- -So you'll be in the middle of a pitch, literally face first on your buzzer. -Nope. -Is it possible that you talk more than Miley? -[ Laughing ] [ Cheers and applause ] -She's coming on the show... Let's talk about "Texoma Shore." -Sure. -These are some of the songs on here. -Okay. -What are you -- ""You're Turning Me On." [ Laughter ] -That's a song on there, yes. -Yes. [ Laughter ] -You think I was just saying that? [ Laughter ] "Turning Me On" is there. You got "Money." You got... "At The House" you're doing today. -Yes. -That's the song you're doing tonight. -Doing that tonight, right here, on your show. -"At The House." And we're psyched that you're doing that. -"At The House." -I love that.

Stephen: NOW WHAT-- WHY DOES THIS SEEM-- IS THIS HARDER OR EASIER THAN BEING AN ACTOR, IN YOUR OPINION?  WELL, MY-- NO ONE WAS EVER KNOCKING DOWN MY DOOR TO PLAY CAPTAIN AMERICA, THAT'S WHAT MY CAREER WAS LIKE. I WROTE A LOT OF OF THE MOVIES I DID. I WROTE "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL" WHEN I WAS 24. AND I WROTE "THE MUPPETS" WITH A FRIEND OF MINE NICK ( APPLAUSE ).  OH, THANKS, THANKS. PRETTY COOL. BUT, HONESTLY, WHEN I WAS WORKING ON "THE MUPETS--" I WANT TO SAY THIS CORRECTLY IN CASE KIDS ARE WATCHING-- BUT THE MUPETS ARE PUPPETS, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: MUPPETS.  WHEN KIDS WOULD COME TO MEET KERMIT, A PUPPETEER IS STANDING RIGHT THERE OPERATING KERMIT, BUT I NOTICED THE KID LOOKS DIRECTLY AT KERMIT. THEY DON'T SEE THE PUPPETEER STANDING NEXT TO THEM. AND I THOUGHT KIDS WANT TO USE THEIR IMAGINATION. THEY WANT TO BELIEVE. AND I WANTED TO START WRITING BOOKS FOR THEM, BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ A BOOK AS A KID YOU'RE DOING HALF THE WORK. I PROVIDE THE WORDS, AND THEIR IMAGINATION DOES THE REST OF THE STORY.  Stephen: THIS IS YOUR FIRST YOUNG ADULT NOVEL.  YEAH.  Stephen: Y.A. WHAT QUALIFIES Y.A.? WHAT'S THAT CATEGORY?  IT'S 16 AND UP. I GET REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THOSE KIDS, BECAUSE I FELT INFERIOR TO THEM WHEN I WAS 16 AND CONTINUE TO. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: MY CHILDREN ARE ALL 16 UP AND, AND THEY'RE WAY SMARTER THAN I AM.  YEAH --  Stephen: I COULDN'T DO THEIR HOMEWORK.  I WAS AT A RESTAURANT THE OTHER DAY, AND THE VALET PARKER CAME AROUND. HE WAS, LIKE, A 16-YEAR-OLD KID STEPPED OUT OF THE CAR AND I WAS INSTANTLY LIKE, "OH, MAN, HE'S SO MUCH COOLER THAN ME."  Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? I BET HE THOUGHT SO, TOO. THAT'S NATURE OF 16-YEAR-OLDS. HOW OLD ARE YOU?  I'M 37 NOW.  Stephen: OLD MAN.  LOOK LIKE THE VICE PRINCIPAL. I WANTED TO INGRAISHATE MYSELF TO THE KID MAKE HIM, I WAS COOL, TOO, AND I TRIED TO MAKE SMALL TALK, "YEAH, LOOKS LIKE SUMMER IS OVER, HEY, BRO."  Stephen: DID YOU ACTUALLY SAY "HEY, BRO."  HE SAID, ," YEAH, THE BRAKES ARE ON." I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT. AND I SAID, "OH, YEAH, BRAKES ARE ON! BRAKES ARE ON! THEY'RE ON!"  Stephen: THE IDEA BEING THAT SUMMER IS OVER AND, THEREFORE, THE BRAKES ARE ON, BECAUSE THE FUN BREAKS.  I GOT IN THE CAR TO DRIVE AWAY AND THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ON.  Stephen: SO LITERALLY THE BRAKES WERE ON. LITERALLY THE BRAKES WERE ON.  YEAR, I'VE BEEN-- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT INTERACTION FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS NOW.  Stephen: WOW.  BECAUSE I WENT FOR IT. "THE BRAKES ARE ON!" YOU SAID IT.  Stephen: MAYBE WE CAN GET IT STARTED. MAYBE WE CAN GET IT STARTED. WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO MEAN? LET'S TRY TO GET IT IT STARTED.  OKAY.  Stephen: WHAT DOES IT MEANS, THE BRAKES ARE ON! WE HAD A GOOD TIME BUT NOW MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GET DOWN TO WORK.  I'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO FOR A LONG TIME WHEN SOMEONE INSULTS SOMEONE TRYING TO MAKE, "OH, YOU'VE GOT MAIL." ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: I KNOW YOU'RE MY GUEST.  YEAH.  Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU WITH THAT ONE. ( LAUGHTER ).  OH,-- RETURN TO SENDER!  Stephen: I WANT TO GET THIS ONE STARTED. MY FRIEND PAUL AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS ONE STARTED. IT'S-- WE'RE TRYING TO GET TEENS TO USE THIS TERM, "OH, THAT'S MASSIVE." WHEN SOMETHING IS REALLY GOOD, "THAT'S MASSIVE."  THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN EXPRESSION AS MUCH AS AN ADJECTIVE.  Stephen: "DO YOU LIKE MY SUIT?" "IT'S MASSIVE." IT'S PERFECT, IT'S PERFECT.  "BRAKES ARE ON."  Stephen: A THIRD PARTY RIGHT NOW SHOULD LOOK AT ME AND SAY, "OH, YOU'VE GOT MAIL."  OH, MY GOD, TOTALLY!  Stephen: RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.  YOU CAN ADD THAT GLAERT WE'LL DO IT POST. IT WILL ALL BE DIGITAL. YOU'VE BEEN A MOVIE STAR, A TV STAR. NOW YOU'RE A STAR IT'S PREVIOUS SERIES LIKE THIS, THERE ARE, LIKE, FIVE BOOKS IN IT. SOMEBODY WILL MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF THIS STUFF. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A BOOK STAR, TO BE OUT WITH KIDS-- AND ADULTS, I ASSUME, AT A READING? IS IT DIFFERENT?  IT'S FUNNY YOU SAID THAT. WHEN YOU GO TO THESE READINGS, HONESTLY, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COME BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BOOK, BUT THE PARENTS WANT TO MEET THE GUY FROM "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL." AND THEY-- WELL, IT'S REALLY A DIFFERENT CROWD. AND SOMETIMES THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF DOING, LIKE, WINE EVENTS BEFORE THESE KIDS BOOK EVENTS. AND I JUST DID ONE -- &gt;-- Stephen: THEY GET YOU DRUNK?  NO, THEY GIVE THE PARENTS-- THEY GIVE THEM SOME ROSE WHILE THE KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK ME PARENTS. THE OTHER DAY, THE FIRST SIX ROSE WERE KIDS, AND THE REST WERE PARENTS. AND I CAME OUT, "I THINK I'LL START READING THE FIRST PAGES OF THIS BOOK." AND A WOMAN SAID, "OR YOU COULD JUST TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).  Stephen: IT'S AN OPTION.  YOU KNOW WHAT WAS SAD? I MADE EYE CONTACT WITH THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER.  Stephen: OH, NO, OH, NO.  AND THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS THAT SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED.  Stephen: OKAY. SO, I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ THE BOOK HERE BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT.  QUICKLY, SINCE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. BASICALLY, IF THE KIDS FROM FREAKFREAKS AND GEEKS GOT SUCKED INTO DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS.  Stephen: THAT'S A QUICK PITCH. DID YOU PLAY D&amp; "D."  I PLAYED "MIST."  Stephen: I REMEMBER "MIST."  I I WAS TERRIBLE AT IT. &gt;IWOULD WANDER AROUND. AND THE BOOK IS ABOUT WHAT IF A COMPANY LIKE AMAZON CREATED A VIRTUAL WORLD SO SEDUCTIVE NOBODY WANTED TO LEAVE. YEAH?   Stephen: I'M IN. I'M IN. I CAN KEEP THIS?  YEAH, IT'S ALL YOURS. I'LL SIGN IT FOR YOU.  Stephen: JACEOB, LOVELY TO SEE YOU. "OTHERWORLD" IS ON SALE NOW. JASON SEGEL, EVERYBODY.I want to ask about this. Because, um, do you have a scuba background? Because you went to an opening of an aquarium in Missouri? -Yes. Yeah, Johnny Morris opened this beautiful wildlife museum. Johhny Morris is the founder of Bass Pro Shop. -Uh-huh. -And all of a sudden, George Bush was there, Jimmy Carter. They´re like, "oh, you want to get in the shark tank?" I´m like, "no, I don´t want to get in the shark tank." They´re like, "no, no, no, it would be really cool. Get in the shark tank with the stingrays and everything else." Next thing you know, I´m diving in this tank. I mean, I literally just showed up to say hello. -Uh-huh. -To show my support for the opening of the museum. -And there you are. That´s, I guess, a little stingray, right? -Yeah. -Although, I don´t mean to say little. If I saw that, I´d be terrified. -That´s how that guy Steve Irwin died. -Yeah. -He got stabbed by a stingray. -I don´t think in, like, an aquarium, though. [ Laughter ] -You know what? I don´t think they´re, like, really trainable animals, either. You know, like, "hey, this one´s not a stinger." That´s a stinger right there, that thing on the back. Yeah, that´s the little thing that -- -No, I think they have to go through a really -- a long training before they let them in the aquarium. -Well, anyway, I went there. We´re trying to persuade these guys to do this Wahlburger partnership, open restaurants in these Bass Pro Shops. ´cause people go there for, like, six hours, and they´re like, "yeah, we´re really into the idea." But now we´re in a tank, and we still don´t have a Wahlburgers in a Bass Pro Shop. [ Laughter ] -Oh, so this was -- you saw this as a business opportunity, and it totally backfired. -You see what I do to support my brand? Uh, yeah. And didn´t work out quite the way I had hoped, so... -And was it -- did it increase the pressure to have two ex-presidents watch you get into a scuba tank? -Oh, they´re all sitting there just having hors d´oeuvres and cocktails and looking... Basically paying no attention to me whatsoever -- -Well, I guess that´s the thing is -- -And you can´t really see out. -Yeah. -You know? And I´m like, "I´ve got to go somewhere else the same day." -Yeah. -And, like, people just kind of left me. There was one other diver. And they were just, like, doing these signals. -[ Laughs ] -And I´m like, "I don´t know scuba signals." -Also, you can barely tell it´s you. So it´s not that exciting to watch if someone´s like, "ladies and gentlemen, Mark Wahlberg." You´d be like, "that could be anybody." -Exactly. -You do get a -- which is very surprising to me, because you´ve been doing this so long and you´re so recognizable. But you do get mistaken for one actor more than other actors. -Yes. -You want to tell us who it is? -My fellow Bostonian Matt Damon. -Yeah. -And by the way, your clip about all the Boston movies... -Oh... -Was one of the funniest things I´ve ever seen. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. -Much better Boston accent than most of the people in Boston, by the way, so thank you for that. -Yes, I don´t think I´m top tier, but I do think I´m better than bottom. -No, it´s -- it´s pretty high. -Yeah. -It´s pretty high. So anyway, yeah, he gets recognized, you know, for me and I get recognized for him. But I never tell people. I never correct anybody. Somebody comes up and says, "hey, I loved you in ´The Bourne.´" I´m like, "thank you. I got another one coming out soon." And I just keep going. [ Cheers and applause ] It´s like, I start explaining -- -Yeah. -I didn´t want to apologize. -Yeah. -They think I´m offended. I´m not offended at all. Not a problem, thank you very much. -[ Laughs ] -I´ll see you later. -You shot some of this movie, "Daddy´s Home 2," in Boston. -Yes. -Is it exciting for you to shoot in Boston? -No. -Okay. -Well, like, random people showing up unannounced and uninvited. No. -Oh, right, ´cause you have such... -But every -- yeah, I have a long history there. You know, it´s nice to be able to see my mom and stuff. But, you know, like, everybody´s like, "oh, I love Boston!" Everybody who, like, went to school to Boston or spent a little time, spent the summer in Nantucket or on the cape, they love it. You know, if you´ve been there, you know, there´s a reason why you wanna -- I mean, I love going back. And I appreciate that I can go back. But I have people from my past, some of them kind of sketchy that´ll show up unannounced. Like, my friends were, like, plotting to steal camera equipment before on "The Perfect Storm." And they were like, "wow, that thing looks expensive." I´m like, "yeah, it´s like $250,000." They´re like, "oh, let´s put it in the trunk." [ Laughter ] I´m like, "who are you going to "sell a Panovision camera to? You´re going to sell it to "George at the store for 500 bucks "and a free -- free pizza? He´s not gonna be able to use it. They´re gonna -- they´re gonna catch you." -I didn´t think of it that way. That makes a lot of sense. Hey, it´s always great to see you. Congrats on the film. It´s a pleasure. -Thanks for having me. Stephen: HEY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. FOLKS, YOUU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM "FOXCATCHER" AND "SPOTLIGHT." HE'S NOW RETURNING AS THE INCREDIBLE HULK IN "THOR: RAGNAROK."

Stephen: YOU LIVE IN AN ORANGE GROVE.  THERE'S A WHOLE TOWN OF PEOPLE.  Stephen: IS THERE A HOME THERE OR DO YOU JUST FROLLIC AMONG THE TREES?  NO, I KIND OF WALK AROUND AND THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE ORANGES LIKE "HOW I MET YOUR MARMALADE." SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  Stephen: THAT WOULD SO SELL.  I KNOW.  Stephen: THAT WOULD SO SELL. CBS WOULD WANT THEIR BEAK WET, BUT THAT WOULD SELL.  I DID A MOVIE CALLED "THE END OF THE TOUR."  Stephen: I SAW, THAT BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE, BEAUTIFUL CHARACTER, I'M SURE.  REALLY SCARY. I RENTED THIS ORANGE GROOVE TO READ INFINITE JEST, BECAUSE I'M NOT A --  Stephen: YOU RENTED AN ORANGE GROVE TO READ A BOOK?  YEAH, YEAH. BECAUSE I HAD THE "HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER" MONEY.  Stephen: THAT'S A REAL HOLLYWOOD THING TO HAVE DONE.  YEAH. AND I WAS REALLY-- I WAS JUST, LIKE, REALLY HAPPY THERE, AND I DECIDED I'M GOING TO STAY. SO I NEVER EYE NEVER WENT BACK.  Stephen: SO IT WAS RENT TO OWN.  YEAH, I ESSENTIALLY LEASED IT.  Stephen: DO YOU LIVE THERE ALONE?  NO, I HAVE A WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND, YEAH.  Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW. BUT I'M HAPPY FOR HER AND YOU.  YEAH, WE'RE BOTH REALLY HAPPY.  Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GREAT PLACE TO START A CULT.  YES, YEAH. I'M RENT WRITING SCI-FI NOVELS AS WELL SO IT'S PERFECT. HEALTHTRONICS.  Stephen: THE THING IS YOU RENTED-- I JUST WANT TO GO BACKUE RENTED AN ORANGE GROVE TO READ A BOOK.  YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.  Stephen: AND--  I DIDN'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE-- HOW YOU DO THE BOOK READING. I-- ( LAUGHTER ) I--  Stephen: I LEASED AN AVOCADO FARM TO DO MY TAXES THIS PAST YEAR.  YEAH, YEAH.  Stephen: YOU GOT GET AWAY FROM IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE LITTLE PEOPLE DO IT, BUT WE JUST HAVE TO GET AWAY. I JUST CAN'T BE DISTRACTED.  I USED TO THINK THE REASON YOU READ A BOOK WAS TO SAY YOU READ THE BOOK, BUT THIS TIME I HAD TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT.  Stephen: SO NOT A BIG READER.  I DO MORE WRITING THANE DO READING.  Stephen: SO NOW YOU LIVE ON THE ORANGE FARM YOU RENTED TO READ A BOOK AND NOW YOU'RE WRITING BOOKS.  YEAH.  Stephen: THIS IS JUR FIFTH BOOK, ISN'T IT?  YEAH, THAT'S NUMBER FIVE.  Stephen: IT'S CALLED "OTHERWORLD."  ( APPLAUSE ).  THANKS.  Stephen: AND BOOK WRITING IS HARD. IT'S REALLY HARD WORK.  YEAH.  Stephen: NOW WHAT-- WHY DOES THIS SEEM-- IS THIS HARDER OR EASIER THAN BEING AN ACTOR, IN YOUR OPINION?  WELL, MY-- NO ONE WAS EVER KNOCKING DOWN MY DOOR TO PLAY CAPTAIN AMERICA, THAT'S WHAT MY CAREER WAS LIKE. I WROTE A LOT OF OF THE MOVIES I DID. I WROTE "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL" WHEN I WAS 24. AND I WROTE "THE MUPPETS" WITH A FRIEND OF MINE NICK ( APPLAUSE ).  OH, THANKS, THANKS. PRETTY COOL. BUT, HONESTLY, WHEN I WAS WORKING ON "THE MUPETS--" I WANT TO SAY THIS CORRECTLY IN CASE KIDS ARE WATCHING-- BUT THE MUPETS ARE PUPPETS, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: MUPPETS.  WHEN KIDS WOULD COME TO MEET KERMIT, A PUPPETEER IS STANDING RIGHT THERE OPERATING KERMIT, BUT I NOTICED THE KID LOOKS DIRECTLY AT KERMIT. THEY DON'T SEE THE PUPPETEER STANDING NEXT TO THEM. AND I THOUGHT KIDS WANT TO USE THEIR IMAGINATION. THEY WANT TO BELIEVE. AND I WANTED TO START WRITING BOOKS FOR THEM, BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ A BOOK AS A KID YOU'RE DOING HALF THE WORK. I PROVIDE THE WORDS, AND THEIR IMAGINATION DOES THE REST OF THE STORY.  Stephen: THIS IS YOUR FIRST YOUNG ADULT NOVEL.  YEAH.  Stephen: Y.A. WHAT QUALIFIES Y.A.? WHAT'S THAT CATEGORY?  IT'S 16 AND UP. I GET REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THOSE KIDS, BECAUSE I FELT INFERIOR TO THEM WHEN I WAS 16 AND CONTINUE TO. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: MY CHILDREN ARE ALL 16 UP AND, AND THEY'RE WAY SMARTER THAN I AM.  YEAH --  Stephen: I COULDN'T DO THEIR HOMEWORK.  I WAS AT A RESTAURANT THE OTHER DAY, AND THE VALET PARKER CAME AROUND. HE WAS, LIKE, A 16-YEAR-OLD KID STEPPED OUT OF THE CAR AND I WAS INSTANTLY LIKE, "OH, MAN, HE'S SO MUCH COOLER THAN ME."  Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? I BET HE THOUGHT SO, TOO. THAT'S NATURE OF 16-YEAR-OLDS. HOW OLD ARE YOU?  I'M 37 NOW.  Stephen: OLD MAN.  LOOK LIKE THE VICE PRINCIPAL. I WANTED TO INGRAISHATE MYSELF TO THE KID MAKE HIM, I WAS COOL, TOO, AND I TRIED TO MAKE SMALL TALK, "YEAH, LOOKS LIKE SUMMER IS OVER, HEY, BRO."  Stephen: DID YOU ACTUALLY SAY "HEY, BRO."  HE SAID, ," YEAH, THE BRAKES ARE ON." I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT. AND I SAID, "OH, YEAH, BRAKES ARE ON! BRAKES ARE ON! THEY'RE ON!"  Stephen: THE IDEA BEING THAT SUMMER IS OVER AND, THEREFORE, THE BRAKES ARE ON, BECAUSE THE FUN BREAKS.  I GOT IN THE CAR TO DRIVE AWAY AND THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ON.  Stephen: SO LITERALLY THE BRAKES WERE ON. LITERALLY THE BRAKES WERE ON.  YEAR, I'VE BEEN-- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT INTERACTION FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS NOW.  Stephen: WOW.  BECAUSE I WENT FOR IT. "THE BRAKES ARE ON!" YOU SAID IT.  Stephen: MAYBE WE CAN GET IT STARTED. MAYBE WE CAN GET IT STARTED. WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO MEAN? LET'S TRY TO GET IT IT STARTED.  OKAY.  Stephen: WHAT DOES IT MEANS, THE BRAKES ARE ON! WE HAD A GOOD TIME BUT NOW MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GET DOWN TO WORK.  I'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO FOR A LONG TIME WHEN SOMEONE INSULTS SOMEONE TRYING TO MAKE, "OH, YOU'VE GOT MAIL." ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: I KNOW YOU'RE MY GUEST.  YEAH.  Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU WITH THAT ONE. ( LAUGHTER ).  OH,-- RETURN TO SENDER!  Stephen: I WANT TO GET THIS ONE STARTED. MY FRIEND PAUL AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS ONE STARTED. IT'S-- WE'RE TRYING TO GET TEENS TO USE THIS TERM, "OH, THAT'S MASSIVE." WHEN SOMETHING IS REALLY GOOD, "THAT'S MASSIVE."  THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN EXPRESSION AS MUCH AS AN ADJECTIVE.  Stephen: "DO YOU LIKE MY SUIT?" "IT'S MASSIVE." IT'S PERFECT, IT'S PERFECT.  "BRAKES ARE ON."  Stephen: A THIRD PARTY RIGHT NOW SHOULD LOOK AT ME AND SAY, "OH, YOU'VE GOT MAIL."  OH, MY GOD, TOTALLY!  Stephen: RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.  YOU CAN ADD THAT GLAERT WE'LL DO IT POST. IT WILL ALL BE DIGITAL. YOU'VE BEEN A MOVIE STAR, A TV STAR. NOW YOU'RE A STAR IT'S PREVIOUS SERIES LIKE THIS, THERE ARE, LIKE, FIVE BOOKS IN IT. SOMEBODY WILL MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF THIS STUFF. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A BOOK STAR, TO BE OUT WITH KIDS-- AND ADULTS, I ASSUME, AT A READING? IS IT DIFFERENT?  IT'S FUNNY YOU SAID THAT. WHEN YOU GO TO THESE READINGS, HONESTLY, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COME BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BOOK, BUT THE PARENTS WANT TO MEET THE GUY FROM "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL." AND THEY-- WELL, IT'S REALLY A DIFFERENT CROWD. AND SOMETIMES THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF DOING, LIKE, WINE EVENTS BEFORE THESE KIDS BOOK EVENTS. AND I JUST DID ONE -- &gt;-- Stephen: THEY GET YOU DRUNK?  NO, THEY GIVE THE PARENTS-- THEY GIVE THEM SOME ROSE WHILE THE KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK ME PARENTS. THE OTHER DAY, THE FIRST SIX ROSE WERE KIDS, AND THE REST WERE PARENTS. AND I CAME OUT, "I THINK I'LL START READING THE FIRST PAGES OF THIS BOOK." AND A WOMAN SAID, "OR YOU COULD JUST TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).  Stephen: IT'S AN OPTION.  YOU KNOW WHAT WAS SAD? I MADE EYE CONTACT WITH THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER.  Stephen: OH, NO, OH, NO.  AND THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS THAT SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED.  Stephen: OKAY. SO, I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ THE BOOK HERE BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT.  QUICKLY, SINCE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. BASICALLY, IF THE KIDS FROM FREAKFREAKS AND GEEKS GOT SUCKED INTO DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS.  Stephen: THAT'S A QUICK PITCH. DID YOU PLAY D&amp; "D."  I PLAYED "MIST."  Stephen: I REMEMBER "MIST."  I I WAS TERRIBLE AT IT. &gt;IWOULD WANDER AROUND. AND THE BOOK IS ABOUT WHAT IF A COMPANY LIKE AMAZON CREATED A VIRTUAL WORLD SO SEDUCTIVE NOBODY WANTED TO LEAVE. YEAH?   Stephen: I'M IN. I'M IN. I CAN KEEP THIS?  YEAH, IT'S ALL YOURS. I'LL SIGN IT FOR YOU.  Stephen: JACEOB, LOVELY TO SEE YOU. "OTHERWORLD" IS ON SALE NOW. JASON SEGEL, EVERYBODY.I'M DOING GOOD. HOW ARE YOU DOING?  I'M DOING WELL, THANK YOU.  Stephen: YOU'RE BACK IN TOWN TO DO A WEEK OF SHOWS IN BROOKLYN AT THE BROOKLYN ACADEMY--  THAT'S RIGHT. NEXT WEEK WE ARE AT THE BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC. WE HEARD-- WHILE YOU ARE TAKING VACATION --  I'M TAKING A WEEK OFF NEXT WEEK. I'M GOING TO FIGHT CRIME AS A COBBLER.  FIVE WEEKS IN A ROW.  Stephen: SIX WEEKS.  SIX WEEKS IN A ROW. IT'S TIME FOR A WEEK'S VACATION, MY FRIEND.  Stephen: HOW MANY DO YOU DO? HOW MANY DO YOU DO?  YOU WORKED SIX WEEKS --  DO YOU WORK MORE THAN SIX WEEKS IN A ROW?  OF COURSE, I-- EVERYONE WORKS MORE THAN SIX WEEKS IN A ROW!  Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU DO A LATE-NIGHT SHOW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  WAS THIS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID TO LES MOONVES, I'D LOVE TO DO THE THE SHOW AND I HAVE A WEEK'S CRUISE BOOKED AND I NEED TO BE AWAY THEN.  Stephen: YOU SHOULD GET A BETTER AGENT.  WE HAVE THE SAME AGENT.  Stephen: YOU AND I I HAVE THE SAME AGENT.  HIS NAME IS JAMES DIXON. HE CALL HIM BABY DOLL DIXON. PEOPLE HAVE SHOARNTED IT TO BABY NOW. PEOPLE THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR DAUGHTERS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENT S.  Stephen: HERE'S SOMETHING PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE AN ARTIST.  I DO A LITTLE BIT OF ART WORK.  Stephen: YOU GAVE THIS TO ME CHRISTMAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. THIS IS A PORTRAIT YOU DID OF OUR AGENT. THIS IS JAMES BABY DOLL DIXON. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE EYE DON'T THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO TELL ANYBODY HIS NAME. PEOPLE WOULD GO, "IS THAT GUY'S NAME BABY DOLL."  THIS IS A SCREEN PRINT. I DREW THE SMOKE. EACH HAS ITS OWN SMOKE CURL.  Stephen: SO THIS IS UNIQUE?  YES.  Stephen: HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK I COULD GET FROM THIS? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS SHOWING UP ON E-BAY?  NO. I THINK YOU COULD GET $100 YOU.  Stephen: HAVE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH BABY DOLL.  I DO, IT'S TOO CLOSE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. JAMES BABY DOLL DIXON. HE'S A VERY WEALTHY MAN, AND HE WILL TELL YOU THAT THE MINUTE YOU MEET HIM.  Stephen: HERE'S ANOTHER PICTURE. THAT'S HIM. THAT'S THE GUY.  Stephen: THIS IS BABY DOLL LIKE IN MID-FEBRUARY. THIS IS AS LOW AS THE TAN EVER GOES. ( LAUGHTER ).  YOU SEE, THERE'S --  IS IT?  THERE'S A RACE BETWEEN HIS SKIN AND HIS LUNGS TO SEE WHO WILL GET CANCER FIRST. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: IT'S LIKE-- IT IS LIKE-- IT'S LIKE WHEN HE SHOWS UP IT'S LIKE WHO PUT A FAMILY BIBLE IN A SHIRT?  WELL, HE-- I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM, BECAUSE HE STAYS AT MY HOUSE-- DOES HE EVER STAY AT YOUR HOUSE?  Stephen: I HAVE NEVER TOLD HIM WHERE I LIVE.  I FEEL LIKE HE BEHAVES DIFFERENTLY-- HE LIVES IN NEW YORK-- WHEN HE COMES TO VISIT IN L.A.  Stephen: THERE'S DEFINITELY EAST COAST BABY DOLL, WEST COAST BABY DOLL.  LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS. EAST COAST BABY DOLL, DOES HE WEAR A LOT OF COLOGNE.  Stephen: I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WITH HIM SOMEPLACE, AND HE HAS SAID, BUT WE HAVE TO STOP. I NEED TO GET SOME COLOGNE." WE GO INTO A CVS AND HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE. DON'T GIVE ME THE PAWK OI RABAN.  HE WEARS ONE KIND OF COLOGNE, VERSACE, IT'S EXPENSIVE AND HE GOES THROUGH-- MY HAND TO STEPHEN UP THERE-- ONE BOTTLE OF COLOGNE A WEEK.  Stephen: HE SMELLS FANTASTIC THOUGH.  HE, DOES, HE SMELLS GREAT. SO DOES MY WHOLE HOUSE NOW THANKS TO HIM. DOES HE CALL YOUR ASSISTANT AND ASK FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S SHOW SOTHAT HE CAN THEN CALL YOU AND TELL YOU HOW GREAT IT WAS THE NEXT DAY?  Stephen: WELL, GOD, GOD, I HOPE NOT! BECAUSE IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU HAVE JUST BLOWN AN ILLUSION THAT I I THOUGHT HE ACTUALLY WATCHES WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.  MAYBE OCCASIONALLY, BUT RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT EVEN WATCHING THIS. HE'S GOT TWO CLIENTS ON AT ONCE AND HE'S OUTSIDE SMOKING. DOES HE BRAG ABOUT HOW MANY HOUSES HIGH OWNS AND COUNTRY CLUBS HE BELONGS TO IN YOUR PRESENCE?  Stephen: HE'S VERY PROUD OF THAT.  HAS HE EVER USED THE SENTENCE, "I'VE GOT TOO MANY CARS," WHEN IT SNOWS IN FRONT OF YOU.  Stephen: THE THING IS, HE'S-- IT'S YOU, ME, JON STEWART. WHO ELSE HAS HE GOT.  JON STEWART, CARSON DALY, ADAMICA ROLLA.  Stephen: HE'S THE REAL KING OF LATE NIGHT. IT'S BABY DOLL DIXON. IT'S THAT GUY RIGHT THERE.  THE LITTLE KING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: SPEAK OF THAT, SPEAKING OF THAT KING OF LATE NIGHT THING, PEOPLE WANT US TO FIGHT AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. ISN'T THAT CRAZY?  IT IS-- YEAH, IT'S WEIRD. IT'S A WEIRD THING. I THINK IT WAS ESTABLISHED WITH LETTERMAN AND LENO AND PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD JUST CONTINUE LIKE THE CRUSADE.  Stephen: I LIKE YOU, THOUGH.  THANK YOU. I LIKE YOU, TOO. I MIGHT EVEN LOVE YOU.  Stephen: REALLY?  YEAH. IF YOU DIED I'D CRY LIKE A BABY.  Stephen: REALLY?  YEAH, GOD FORBID.  Stephen: WOW, IF I DIDN'T HAVE A SHOW, I WOULD COME TO YOUR FUNERAL.( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT FROM HIS WORK ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." HE CURRENTLY STARS AS KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON." PLEASE WELCOME, TARAN KILLAM! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )  THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU, THANK YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH! VERY NICE PEOPLE!  Stephen: VERY NICE. THE NICEST OF PEOPLE.  Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME IN THE CONTENSIONLE.  YOU'RE WELCOME.  Stephen: LONELY IN THERE. I DON'T THINK I HAVE BEEN JOINED IN THERE BEFORE.  JUST STARTED CRAWLING THERE FROM BACKSTAGE.  Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU ARE KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON" NOW.  YES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.  Stephen: DID YOU TAKE IT JUST FOR THE PART OR IS IT THE ONLY WAY TO GET TICKETS TO "HAMILTON" AT THIS POINT?  BOTH A AND B AT THIS POINT.  Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A SINGER.  WHAT I STARTED OUT DOING. I WENT TO COLLEGE FOR MUSICAL THEATER AND THEN COMEDY TOOK OVER.  Stephen: STARTED IN MUSICAL THEATER AND DECIDED TO GO FOR THE BIG MONEY IN COMEDY!  IT HAS WORKED OUT AND IT'S AN HONOR. THE SHOW IS INCREDIBLE. YOU'VE ALLIN' IT, RIGHT? SORRY! SORRY TO RUB YOUR NOSE IN THAT. NO, IT'S SO AMAZING. I WAS A HUGE FAN OF IT AND I KNOW LYNN AND TOMMY AND THEY INVITED ME TO BE A PART OF THE SHOW.  Stephen: WE'VE HAD ANDREW REYNOLDS AND JOHN GRAF TO TALK ABOUT PLAYING THE PART BEFORE YOU. THE CROWN IS THE WORST PART OF IT.  IT STINKS. IT'S SO HEAVY. YOU'RE IN HEELS. AND FOR THE FIRST PART YOU HAVE A GIANT VELVET CAPE SWAYING TO AND FROE, LIKE TOSSING YOU IN A SHIP. IT'S JUST THE JOB TO WALK A STRAIGHT LINE. IT'S A SELF-DEFEATING ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO WARDROBE. I THINK I'M THE TALLEST. IN THE HEELS AND CROWN, I HAVE TO DUCK UNDER THE SET WHEN I MAKE MY ENTRANCES AND MY THIRD SHOW EVER, I DID NOT. IT KNOCKED THE CROWN TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD LIKE A PRECOCIOUS APPLE DUMPLING GANG CHARACTER.  Stephen: THE KING! YEAH, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN THERE'S THE PART WHERE I HAVE TO, LIKE, SKIP IN JOY, AND I DO THAT, AND FOR ME IT WAS LIKE SLOW MOTION, THE CROWN COMES OFF AND SMASHES ON THE STAGE.  Stephen: DID IT GET A LAUGH?  A HUGE LAUGH. IT WAS GREAT. YOU LITERALLY CAN'T FAIL IN THAT ROLE. IT'S SO NICE.  Stephen: EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THE SHOW AND PEOPLE PULL ALL KINDS OF STRINGS TO GET IN THERE. PEOPLE COME BACKSTAGE, LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MEETING THAT PERSON! NOT LIKE YOU DON'T MEET A LOT OF FAMOUS PEOPLE. LIKE WORLD LEADERS COME.  TRUE. FOR MESARA MICHELLE GELLAR CAME LAST WEEK.  Stephen: BUFFY? BUFFY.  Stephen: WORLD LEADER. WORLD LEADER. DIMENSIONAL LEADER, REALLY, IF WE'RE GETTING TECHNICAL. THE FIRST TIME, MAYBE THE ONLY TIME I'VE CRIED IN EARNEST AT NARRATIVE TELEVISION WAS ON BUFFY WHEN ANGEL LOSES HIS SOUL AGAIN AND SHE HAS TO STAB HIM THROUGH THE HEART TO CLOSE THE HELL MOUTH. ( LAUGHTER ) I PLAYED IT MUCH COOLER THAN NOW. I WAS LIKE, THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE SHOW, I'M A HUGE FAN, BUFFY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! AND I RAN BACKSTAGE.  Stephen: YOU'RE FAMOUS FOR YOUR IMPRESSIONS. IMPRESSIONS THAT NOBODY HAD A HOOK FOR. NOBODY DID BRAD PITTT AND YOU HAD A HOOK FOR BRAD PITT. McConaughey is a very small needle to thread. YOU MUST RUN INTO THEM AFTER DOING THEIR IMPRESSIONS.  NO ONE LIKES THEIR IMPRESSION. SO THEY'LL QUICKLY SKIRT TO YOU DO THIS PERSON GREAT AND THAT PERSON GREAT, YOU REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ME. THAT IS WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY. BUT I WAS BACKSTAGE AT THE 40th, SOMEBODY WHO I GOT TO MEET AND NEVER GOT TO DO ON THE SHOW, IT WAS MY FAVORITE EXPERIENCE IN PASSING, 40t 40th WAS CRAZY. THERE'S TONS OF PEOPLE THERE FROM ALL GENERATIONS OF THE SHOW.  Stephen: 40t 40th ANNIVERSARY.  OF "SNL," EXACTLY. I SEE OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE JEFF GOLDBLUM WALKS UP AND AIM BIG FAN, HE SAYS, YES, YES, YES, YES, GOOD, VERY GOOD, THEN KEPT WALKING. I'M, LIKE, THAT'S IT. I'M DONE. THAT'S ALL I NEED, IF I DO NOTHING ELSE. THAT'S IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS, THIS SEASON "SNL" IS HAVING AN AMAZING SEASON, THE RATINGS ARE GREAT, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT AND THE SHOW HAS BEEN WONDERFUL. ALEC BALD WITHIN, McCARTHY, SEAN SPICER IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE I'VE EVER SEEN. PEOPLE WHO COME IN WHO WEREN'T EVEN THE HOST THAT WEEK, WHEN NON-CAST MEMBERS COME IN AND DO THE IMPRESSIONS, DOES THE CAST THERE GO, HEY, WE'RE THE ENSEMBLE, WHY AREN'T WE DOING THOSE? I FEEL BAD FOR THE CAST WHO DON'T GET A CHOMP AT THAT.  NO, IT'S DONE WELL. I WAS THERE WHEN THEY HAD LARRY DAVID COME IN FOR BERNIE SANDERS, AND IT'S ALWAYS WITHIN SORT OF THE FAMILY OF COMEDY AND PEOPLE THAT WE RESPECT. SO I THINK IT'S MORE THAN ANYTHING JUST AS EXCITING FOR US. I MEAN, MELISSA WAS THE PERSON, I CAME FROM THE THEATER IN LOS ANGELES AND SHE DID AS WELL, AND MELISSA WAS THE PERSON WHO I WOULD GO OUT OF THE WAY TO SEE.  Stephen: SHE'S EXTRAORDINARY.  SHE'S A GENIUS.  Stephen: DID YOU EVER DO SCHWARZENEGGER?  I DIDN'T DO HIM ON THE SHOW BUT DIRECTED HIM IN A MOVIE THIS PAST SUMMER WHICH WAS VERY COOL, VERY EXCITING FOR ME. I DIRECTED A FILM WHY ARE WE KILLING DON'TER, A MOCKMENTRY ABOUT CONTRACT KILLERS TRYING TO KILL THE MOST FAMOUS HIT MAN TO USURP THE KING AND WE GOT ARNOLD TO BE GUNTHER, SPOILER ALERT. IT WAS CRAZY BECAUSE I FACETIMEED WITH HIM. MY ASSISTANT SAID I'M GOING TO HAND YOU TO ARNOLD NOW, HE WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF A SIX FOOT DESK, SMOKING CIGAR BEHIND A PICTURE FROM HIS PUMPING IRON DAYS. HE SAID, HELLO, TARAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU!

IT MUST TAKE HOURS TO GET IN THAT GREEN HULK MAKEUP.  NO, THERE'S NO MAKEUP AT ALL.  Stephen: NEVER?  NO I HAVE TO WEAR A SILLY LITTLE SUIT.  Stephen: IS THAT WHAT THIS IS? YES, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. THERE YOU ARE. THERE YOU ARE.  A TRAINED ACTOR REDUCED TO A CHINESE CHECKERBOARD. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: IN THAT SCENE, LIKE, THE GRUNTING.  THAT'S MINE.  Stephen: BUT DO YOU --  I DO ALL MY OWN GRUNTING, STEVE! ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: BUT DO YOU ACTUALLY DO THE GRUNTING? THEY DON'T LAY THE GRUNTING IN THERE.  I DO MY GRUNTING. I DO MY YELLING, I DO MY ROARING, THAT'S ME.  Stephen: WHEN YOU DO, "HULK NO LIKE," THAT'S YOU.  HULK LIKE FIRE, THOR LIKE WATER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: TOTALLY BUY IT. TOTALLY BUY IT. ♪ ♪ ♪  YEAH!  Stephen: SO THE THE NEW MOVIE IS "THOR: RAGNAROK. THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU WERE HERE FOR "SPOTLIGHT."

I KNOW YOU'RE A SERIOUS OORKT AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU TOOK THAT "SPOTLIGHT" EXPERIENCE, AND THE PERFORMANCE OF HULK WITH SOME OF THAT REALLY HEARTBREAKING, SOUL-SEARCHING, REALLY SCATHING INDICTMENT OF AMERICA'S SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND RELIGIOUS POWER STRUCTURE? ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER ) IS IT DIFFERENT? IS IT DIFFERENT MOVIE?  IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.  Stephen: YEAH. I SAW THEM BOTH. I LIKED THEM BOTH VERY MUCH.

Stephen: TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU DID THAT MUST HAVE DRIVEN MARVEL OR DISNEY CRAZY. YOU GAVE AWAY THE WHOLE MOVIE, DIDN'T YOU?  WELL, ONLY THE FIRST 10 MINUTES OF IT.  Stephen: HOW DID YOU DO THIS AGAIN?  WELL, IN MY DEFENSE --  Stephen: SOMEONE ATTACKING YOU?  THEY ASKED ME TO DO AN INSTAGRAM LIVE POST.  Stephen: WHO DID?  MARVEL! DISNEY!  Stephen: YEAH.  AND SO-- AND SO I SAID I WOULD DO THAT, BUT I HAD NEVER DONE INSTAGRAM LIVE SO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW IT WORKED.  Stephen: BECAUSE ARE YOU A...  GRANDPA!  Stephen: YES.  IT WAS A GRANDPA MOVE. I WENT TO BED A LEADING MAN, AND SOMEHOW I WOKE UP A GRANDPA, OKAY. BUT I-- SO I WENT BACKSTAGE, AND I WAS-- I WAS DOING THE INSTAGRAM LIVE, AND IT WAS FUN AND GAMES AND EVERYONE LOVED IT. AND I WAS DOING THE AUDIENCE. AND THEN THEY SAID, "RETURN TO YOUR SEAT. WE'RE GOING TO START MOVIE. OF THE SO I PUSHED THE BUTTON, WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING TO STOP IT, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER BUTTON TO STOP IT.  Stephen: WHAT DID THE FIRST BUTTON DO?  THE FIRST BUTTON JUST TELLS YOU TO PUSH THE SECOND BUTTON TO STOP IT.  Stephen: WHY NOT MAKE THE FIRST BUTTON TO STOP IT.  THAT'S WHAT I SAID!  Stephen: SO?  SO I ENDED UP SHOVING IT IN MY POCKET AND SITTING DOWN AND WATCHING THE MOVIE. WELL, IT WAS LIVE. ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: SO IT WAS BROADCASTING...  IT'S BROADCASTING TO THE MOVIE BASICALLY FREE TO MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF HOPEFULLY PAYING VIEWERS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND --  Stephen: HOW DID YOU FIND OUT--  AND MY PHONE WAS BLOWING UP. PEOPLE WERE TEXTING ME. AND I MUST GOT 50 TEXTS IN 10 MINUTES.  Stephen: SAYING, "STOP THIS, YOU IDIOT."  OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE SAYING BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE AND TAKE OUT MY PHONE AND LOOK AT THE TEXT S.  Stephen: YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO THAT.  YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN A MOVIE! YOU'RE AN A-HOLE IF YOU DO THAT.  Stephen: DO YOU HAVE IT WITH YOU? DO YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE WITH YOU?  NO GOOD DEED-- YEAH, BUDDY. NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED. I'M SITTING THERE ENJOYING THE MOVIE WITH MY FAMILY, AND A WOMAN CAME UP AND SHE POKED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND I TURNED AND I SAID, "YEAH, WHAT, WHAT IN? AND SHE SAID, "YOUR PHONE IS ON!

Stephen: SO IT'S THE EIGHTH IN A SERIES.  WE'RE DOING "AVENGERS 3 AND FOUR," OR "INFINITE WAR 1 AND TWO." I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING.  Stephen: WHEN WILL THEY MAKE UP THEIR MIND?  ONCE THEY TEST SCREEN TPROBABLY.  Stephen: HAVE YOU DONE "INFINITE WAR 1 IN? AND "AVENGERS 3?"  YES.  Stephen: AND WHEN DO WE GET TO SEE THAT?  WHEN IT COMES OUT, STEVE.

THOR AND HULK-- AND HULK TALKS A LOT IN THIS.  HE DOES.  Stephen: DID YOU INSIST, "I'M GOING TO DO THIS MOVIE BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME WORDS TO SAY."  I'M SO SICK OF GRUNTING.

Stephen: JOHN MULANEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME? THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE BEEN HERE.  Stephen: THE THIRD TIME?  YEAH.  Stephen: THIRD TIME'S A CHARM.  THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.  Stephen: WE'LL GET IT THIS TIME.  YEAH, WE'LL BE CHARMING THIS TIME.  Stephen: THAT'S A LOVELY JACKET. VELVET?  YEAH, THIS IS BLACK VELVET. THIS COLLECTED A LOT OF STUFF BACKSTAGE, BUT THEY ROLLED ME OFF WITH TAPE, AND THEN I WALKED OUT, AND NOW I'M ON TV.  Stephen: YEAH. WE KNOW IT'S THE CHANGE OF SEASON WHEN YOU CAN BRING THE BLACK VELVET OUT.  ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S AN OLD MEL TORME LINE. "THE CHANGE OF THE SEASON IS WHEN YOU CAN BRING THE OLD VELVET OUT."  Stephen: YOU'RE SUPER BUSY, SUPER BUSY. NO SURPRISE THERE. A YOUNG TALENTED MOON LIKE YOU.  THAT'S NICE OF YOU TO SAY. I HAVE BEEN ON TOUR SINCE MAY AND NOW IT'S GONE EVERY NIGHT.  Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN "GONE EVERY NIGHT?"  ON THE RIDE.  Stephen: YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AND THEN DADDY'S GONE.  I DON'T SAY "DADDY'S GONE." THAT UPSETS PEOPLE.  Stephen: DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?  NO, I HAVE A DOG, THOUGH.  Stephen: THEN YOU SHOULD NOT SAY, "DADDY'S GONE. OF IT WOULD BE WEIRD TO SAY TO YOUR WIFE, "DADDY'S GONE."  YEAH, WE'VE BEEN GONE-- WE-- I, HAVE BEEN TRAVELING A LOT. AND THAT'S WHY I DON'T KNOW MY ARTICLES OR PRONOUNS.  Stephen: SO, IT'S CALLED "KID GORGEOUS. OF THE.  THE TOUR.  Stephen: ARE YOU "KID GORGEOUS"?  I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST A NAME. I KEPT READING NAMES TO MY WIFE AT A RESTAURANT UNTIL SHE LAUGHED, AND THAT WAS THE ONE SHE WENT WITH. SHE LAUGHED A LOT AT "KID GORGEOUS," AND I SAID I GUESS IT HAS TO BE THAT. I LIKE OLD-FASHIONED THINGS, AND "KID GORGEOUS" --  Stephen: "KID GORGEOUS" SOUND LIKE YOU'RE A MIDDLE-WEIGHT BOXER.  YES, YES.  Stephen: WHO IS FAMOUS FOR NEVER HAVING HIS NOSE BROKEN.  YES.  Stephen: HE'S "KID GORGEOUS."  THERE WAS A MO ON THE SIMPSONS, WAS "KID GORGEOUS," THEN HE WAS "KID PRESENTABLE." AND I WANTED IT TO BE CALLED "KID CHARLEMAGNE" AFTER THE STEELY DAN SONG, BUT EVERYONE IN MY LIFE WARNED ME AGAINST THAT, SAYING THAT WOULD BE LOST ON PEOPLE AND NOT BE AN EFFECTIVE TOUR NAME.  Stephen: WHEREAS "KID GORGEOUS" HAS RESONANCE ALL ACROSS AMERICA.  PEOPLE LIKE VANITY, YEAH.  Stephen: YOU'RE COMING BACK TO NEW YORK FOR A FOUR NIGHTS AT RADIO CITY, TOTALLY STOLE OUT.  FOUR SHOWS SOLD OUT, YEAH. AND WE'RE ADDING A FIFTH NOW, SO, YEAH. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  Stephen: THAT'S GREAT GREAT. YOU HAVE PLAYED RADIO CITY BEFORE?  I HAVE NEVER PLAYED RADIO CITY.  Stephen: EXTRAORDINARY, EXTRAORDINARY HOUSE.  EXTRAORDINARY PLACE. I WANT TO REST BEFORE IT. I'M GETTING A LITTLE FRIED ON THIS TOUR, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE AN AMAZING --  Stephen: LIKE WHAT KIND OF REST DO YOU NEED?  I NEED-- SO I TOOK A VACATION WITH MY WIFE, ANA. I HAD BEEN GONE ABOUT 12 NIGHTS, AND WE WENT TO FAIRM TO RELAX IN CONNECTICUT.  Stephen: OH, OKAY.  WE GOT THERE --  Stephen: SOMEBODY GAVE ME PHOTOS BEFORE YOU CAME OUT HERE. IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?  YEAH, I'LL SHOW YOU THAT IN A MOMENT. I HAD A BIT OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN WHILE I WAS AT THE FARM.  Stephen: OKAY.  I LAND FROM SAN FRANCISCO. WE GET A RENTAL CAR AND WE DRIVE TO CONNECTICUT. AND WE GET THERE, AND I'M REALLY HOLOCAUSAND I'MREALLY EXHAUSTED EXISTENTIALLY INSANE, AND TRYING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.  Stephen: SURE.  AND THE CURRENT PRESIDENT TWEETED SOMETHING LIKE, "NO TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?" AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S NOT HELPING MY SITUATION." THAT WAS THAT WEEKEND HE DID THAT. I WAS OUT WALKING WITH MY DOG TRYING TO CALM DOWN, AND I SAW A GAGGLE OF GEESE?  Stephen: A GAGGLE OF GEESE, YES.  A GAGGLE OF GEESE. AND I RAN TOWARDS THEM AND THEY FLEW AWAY AND IT WAS AMUSING. LATER ON THE GEESE WERE BACK AND I HAD THE DOG AND I SAY TO MY WIFE, "CHECK THIS OUT." AND I RUN TOWARDS THE GEESE, AND THEY HOLD THEIR GROUND, AND ONE OF THEM LOOKS AT ME AND OPENS HIS MOUTH, AND HE HAD THIS LIGHT, PINK MOUTH, AND HE WENT "HAAAA." AND CAVEMAN D.N.A. IN ME KNEW GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW. LIKE, SOME OLD ANCESTOR RAN INTO SOME PTERODACTYLS AND IT WASN'T GOOD, AND THIS WAS LIKE THAT. IT WAS LIKE THESE ARE DINOSAURS, LIKE, GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW. AND I RAN ACROSS THE CREEK, AND I SAID TO MY WIFE, "THOSE GEESE WEREN'T MESSING AROUND" YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAY THAT TO YOUR WIFE? ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: YEAH.  AND SHE SAID, WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING? GEESE ATTACK PEOPLE." HE SAID, "YOU'RE SUCH A CITY BOY." I SAID, "I DIDN'T KNOW GEESE ATTACKED PEOPLE." SHE SAID, "YEAH, MY BROTHER WAS ATTACKED BY A SWAN ( LAUGHTER ) SO LATER ON IN THE EVENING --  Stephen: NOT THE SAME AS A GOOSE.  NOT THE SAME AS A GOOSE. BUT YOU EXPECT MORE FROM A SWAN BECAUSE IT'S MORE COSMOPOLITAN.  Stephen: THEY'RE GLAMOROUS.  THEY'RE GLAMOROUS, YES. WE HOLD THEM TO A HIGHER DEGREE. IT'S SAD. SO I'M SITTING-- OKAY, THIS WAS, LIKE, FATIGUE-- AND I'M ALSO TRYING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN FRONT OF MY WIFE. I DIDN'T TELL HER ABOUT THE NUCLEAR WAR STUFF AS IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH A NEWSPAPER "I'LL HIDE THIS." THE DOG JUMPS INTO MY LAP, IT'S A NICE MOMENT. MY WIFE TAKES A PHOTO OF IT.  Stephen: IS THIS IT?  ONE SECOND. NO, I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOUR FLOW. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW WE TOOK A PHOTO. WE LOOK AT IT. THEN I LEAVE THE ROOM AND SHE WE COME BACK AND LOOK AT IT AGAIN, AND THAT'S A GREEN SPOT THAT WE NEVER SAW RIGHT THERE WHERE MY WEDDING BAND MEETS MY DOG'S STOMACH.  Stephen: WE HAVE A CLOSE-UP.  AND I SAID, "WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?" WE ZOOM IN, PUSH IT, ASK IT LOOKS LIKE THE MOON THROUGH THE TREES. AND I SAID, "WHAT IS THAT?" AND AS SOON AS I SAID, "WHAT IS THAT?" SOME VOICE IN ME THAT WARNED ME ABOUT THE GEESE SAID, "YOU KNOW IT'S A GHOST." ( LAUGHTER ) SO... ( LAUGHTER ) IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT A GREEN ORB APPEARS ON YOUR DOG IN A PHOTO. THAT VERY MUCH LOOKS LIKE THE MOON THROUGH THE TREES. AND IMAGINE YOU'RE EXHAUSTED. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW YOU'D LEAP TO GHOST.  Stephen: SURE. ( LAUGHTER )  HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN A GHOST?  Stephen: IDON'T THINK SO... I MEAN, I DON'T THINK SO. THIS PLACE MIGHT BE HAUNTED.  YES THEATERS ARE HAUPTED.  Stephen: EXREECTLY HAUNTED.  I'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD IN THEATERS 1900 AND 1910. AND I WAS VERY CAVALIER ABOUT GHOSTGHOSTS AND I'D SAY, "IS THI PLACE HAUNTED? AND WE'D LAUGH ABOUT A GOFT IN THERE. I FELT I HAD A HAUNTING OF SORTS.  Stephen: THEATERS HAVE A GHOST LIGHT TO KEEP THE GHOST IN ON PURPOSE.  IF YOU ASK-- IF YOU GO TO AN OLD THEATER, ASK THE STAGEHANDS, "IS THERE A GHOST HERE?" AND THEY'LL BE LIKE, "THERE'S A GHOST." I DID A THEATER IN KANSAS CITY, CALLED THE MIDLANDS, AND THEY SAID THE JANITOR WAS KILLED THERE IN 1910 AND STILL HAUNTS THE LOBBY. I SAID, "WHAT DOES HE DO?" THEY SAID, "WE SEE HIM SWEEPING UP." AND I SAID, "THAT'S DOUBLE TERRIBLE THAT HE'S STUCK BETWEEN REALMS AND HE STILL HAS TO CLEAN THE LOBBY." IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WERE LIKE, "WE SAW HIM APPLYING FOR A NEW POSITION, THEN WE-- THEN WE SAW HIM MANAGING THE LOBBY."  Stephen: I KNOW THERE'S A GHOST IN THIS BUILDING BECAUSE SOMETIMES, LIKE, EVEN DURING THE SHOW, LIKE, A GUEST WILL BE SITTING RIGHT THERE, AND I'LL HEAR THIS VOICE COMING FROM THE GUEST GOING, "I WISH DAVE WAS STILL HERE." ( LAUGHTER ).  THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING DAVE PLANTED.  Stephen: YEAH, PROBABLY.  SO I SAW THAT, AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELD IT TOGETHER ALL DAY.  Stephen: THIS IS TODAY?  NO, NO, THAT DAY AT THE FARM.  Stephen: OKAY.  I PUSH IN ON THE PHOTO, AND I GO, "TELL ME THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE MOON THROUGH THE TREES." AND MY WIFE'S LIKE, "ARE YOU OKAY?" AND I SAID, "I THINK WE NEED TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW."  Stephen: NO, YOU DIDN'T.  I DID, YEAH.  Stephen: YOU CAN'T GET YOUR DEPOSIT BACK BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU SAW A GHOST.  NO, YOU CANNOT. BUT IT WAS ALREADY DARK ON THE FARM ROADS, AND I WAS LIKE, "IF THIS WERE A MOVIE, WOULD IT BE A GOOD IDEA TO DRIVE OUT IN THE DARK?" AND, ALSO, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY TOO LOUD WHAT MY PLAN WAS IN CASE THE GHOSTS WERE LISTENING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M SAD TO SAY --  Stephen: WERE THE GHOSTING SAYING ANYTHING? WERE YOU GETTING VOICES IN YOUR HEAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT-- "SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND YOU. SHE'S YOUR ENEMY. DO SOMETHING!" LIKE ONE OF THOSE "SHINING, ."  NO, BECAUSE I WAS POSSESSED I WAS ASSUMING MY DOG WAS POSSESSED. WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE WAS LENS FLARE. WE LOOKED IT UP AND ON, LIKE-- I WON'T SAY WHAT BRAND OF PHONE BUT IT'S AN iPHONE. AND THEY HAVE-- IT'S A COMMON THING WHERE YOU GET THESE GREEN DOTS, AND THAT'S THE REFLECTION OF THE SUN COMING THROUGH THE TREES AND THE WINDOW PANE BEHIND ME.  Stephen: IF YOU SAW THIS ON YOUR DOG NOT ON CAMERA, THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO BE UPSET ABOUT.  I WOULD BOW DOWN IN FRONT OF HER AND SAY I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.  Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY LIKE, "BIG MOUTH."  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  Stephen: THE SHOW YOU'RE DOING WITH NICK KROLL, OUR FRIEND OF THE SHOW.  THIS IS A WONDERFUL ANIMATED SHOW ON NETFLIX, THAT NICK KROLL AND ANDREW GOLDBERG, HIS FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD CREATED --  Stephen: YOU PLAY ANDREW.  YEAH, I AM A GET FRIEND IN ADULT LIFE.  Stephen: IT'S ABOUT KIDS GOING THROUGH PUBERTY AND VERY FUNNY AND VERY HONEST, HARROWING WAYS.  YEAH.  Stephen: BECAUSE PUBERTY IS VERY UPSETTING.  YES, IT FEELS-- IT'S SORT OF A REALIST, NIGHTMARISH ESCAPE OF PUBERTY COMEDY, AND I THINK IT'S HOW-- IT'S HOW PUBERTY FIELD IN A LOT OF WAYS.  Stephen: DID YOU GO TO CATHOLIC SCHOOLS GROWING UP?  YEAH, ONLY EXCLUSIVELY.  Stephen: JESUIT SCHOOLS. ANOTHER THEY TEACH YOU GOOD. BUT DID THEY TEACH YOU, LIKE, ABOUT SEX? DID YOU HAVE, LIKE, PUBERTY, LIKE HEALTH CLASS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?  WE HAD HEALTH CLASS.  Stephen: DID THEY GO THROUGH THE BIRDS AND THE BEES.  WE DID A SORT OF MIRACLE ON LIFE ON THE "PLEASE DON'T EVER HAVE SEX" SIDE OF IT.  Stephen: OKAY. IT'S A MIRACLE THAT YOU WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH.  YEAH, AND THEY SAID-- THEY WERE LIKE, "NONE OF THE CONTRACEPTIVES WORK, SO DON'T TRY THEM." WELL --  Stephen: WOW.  WELL, YOU KNOW, WE WERE KIDS. IT'S UNFORTUNATELY HAD A LASTING EFFECT IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS OF MY BRAIN, BUT... ( LAUGHTER ) THEY THEN-- THE BIG THING WAS THEY WOULD SHOW US THE "MIRACLE OF LIFE" VIDEO, AND I FAINTED AT THAT, NOT ONE YEAR, NOT TWO YEARS, BUT THREE YEARS IN A ROW. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: I HESITATE TO ASK-- WHAT IS IS IN "THE MIRACLE OF LIFE" VIDEO THAT WOULD MAKE JOHN MULANEY PASS OUTSIDE?  I DON'T KNOW ANYONE THAT HAS SEEN IT. IT BEGINS WITH A COUPLE THAT DOES NOT LOOK CONTEMPORARY, EARLY 1980s, OR LATE 1970s. AND THEN IT GOES TO ANIMATION ABOUT HOW THEIR TUBES AND DIFFERENT VALVES WORK. AND THEN YOU'RE LIKE WATCHING THESE DIAGRAMS AND YOU'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT." AND THEN IT'S A HARD CUT TO THE ENTRY OF A HUMAN INTO THE WORLD.  Stephen: OF A HUMAN!  COMING THROUGH THE LOINS OF THEIR MOTHER-- WHICH IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.  Stephen, OF COURSE, NOT! WE'VE ALL DONE THAT.  PERFECTLY NATURAL. ABSOLUTELY. EVEN CESAREAN, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT. IT'S ALL FANTASTIC. SO I WOULD LOOK, AND I WENT-- THE FIRST YEAR I WENT, "HUH?" AND THEN I WAS ON THE FLOOR. ( LAUGHTER ) THE SECOND YEAR --  Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING?  THE SECOND YEAR I KNOW IT'S COMING. I GO, "NO WAY AM I GOING TO FLINCH THIS TIME." SO I STARED LONGER. AND I WATCHED MORE OF THE OPENING NUMBER. ( LAUGHTER ) HIT THE FLOOR. THE THIRD YEAR, PEOPLE WERE ROOTING FOR ME TO FAINT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND LOOKING BACK. AND THEY-- THEY WERE GOING, "HE'S GONNA GO. HE'S GONNA FAINT." AND I JUST-- THE PRESSURE-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WAS WATCHING THE VIDEO. I THINK I HAD A PANIC ATTACK BECAUSE ALL THE EYES WERE ON ME. AND I FAINTED AGAIN, JUST TO-- MAYBE JUST TO APPEASE THEM. WHAT A LIFE! WHAT A SAD LIFE TO WANT TO ENTERTAIN SO MUCH THAT I'LL COLLAPSE FOR YOU IF YOU CHEER LOUD ENOUGH.  Stephen: YOU'RE A PRO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE KID GORGEOUS IS WHAT YOU WERE.  THANK YOU.  Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU.  JOHN MULANEY'S "KID GORGEOUS" IS AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HILL THIS FEBRUARY. JOHN MULANEY, EVERYBODY!GOES, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM "FROZEN," "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST," AND "THE BOOK OF MORMON." HE DOES A LITTLE LESS SINGING IN "MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS."  YOU STOLE FROM ME! THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE FOUND OUT, THAT IS WHY YOU KILLED HIM! YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I STOLE FROM HIM. THOUSANDS. I KNEW HIS MONEY WASN'T HONEST. WHAT DID IT MATTER IF I SKIMMED SOME OFF THE TOP? BUT LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION -- WHY WOULD I SLAUGHTER MY CASH COW? I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T KILL HIM!  Stephen: I THINK HE DID (WHISPERING). PLEASE WELCOME JOSH GAD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) YOU TOTALLY KILLED HIM.  CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING BEFORE WE BEGIN IN ALL THIS? YOU ARE SO BRILLIANT. I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR SPEECH BACKSTAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AMAZING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  Stephen: NICE OF YOU TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S BRILLIANT?  NO, TELL ME.  Stephen: OLAF FROM "FROZEN."  THERE HE IS, FLYING! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: THIS IS A MILESTONE IN AN ARTIST'S CAREER. SO FEW -- MORE PEOPLE LANDED ON THEIR MOON THAN HAVE THEIR OWN MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE BALLOON.  IS THAT TRUE?  Stephen: WE LOOKED IT UP. MORE PEOPLE HAVE LANDED ON THE MOON THAN HAVE THEIR OWN BALLOON. YOU'RE THENAUT.  I'M SO SORRY TO N.A.S.A. ABOUT THIS FACT. I FEEL LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE A STEPHEN COLBERT BALLOON AS WELL! WOULD THAT BE WEIRD?  Stephen: I'M WORKING ON IT. YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: THIS YEAR IS THE FIRST TIME?  THIS IS GOING TO BE THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, OLAF WILL BE FLYING IN THE MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE. AS A KID, I WOULD WATCH THIS ALL THE TIME, AND I WAS NEVER, LIKE, ONE DAY, I'LL BE A SNOWMAN, AND THAT SNOWMAN WILL HAVE HIS OWN BALLOON! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT? ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: YEAH, IF THIS HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE PARADE BEFORE, WHAT ARE WE SEEING?  I THINK OLAF WAS JUST, LIKE, I'M NOT GONNA WAIT ANY LONGER, I'M GONNA GO FLY!  Stephen: YOU GET TO RIDE IN IT THE WHOLE WAY.  IS THIS THE ENTIRE TIME. I'M UP THERE PILOTING IT. THIS IS CRAZY! WOW!  Stephen: LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY. WHO WANTS TO GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE PARADE, BULLWINKLE, POKEÉMON --  POKEÉMON, AFTER PLAYING THE GAME RELENTLESSLY LAST YEAR AND WATCHING YOUR COLD OPENING, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO GO ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: YEAH, PROBABLY, PROBABLY. SO HERE'S THE DEAL, YOU'RE OLAF'S VOICE IN "FROZEN." YOU'VE DONE FIVE OTHER PROJECTS.  AS OLAF.  Stephen: BUT THE SEQUEL HASN'T COME OUT YET.  DON'T YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT IF IT HAD COME OUT?  Stephen: ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN AD OR TWO.  THE SEQUEL NOBODY'S SEEN.  Stephen: DISNEY DOESN'T LIKE TO ADVERTISE.  NO, THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, WE'RE WORKING ON IT.  Stephen: WHAT ARE THE OTHER FIVE THINGS?  THERE ARE ALL THESE FROZEN SHORTS. ONE IS CALLED OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE IN FRONT OF COCOA, THE PIXAR MOVIE.  Stephen: IS THERE A OLAF CHIP IN YOUR NECK SO THEY CAN THROW A BAG OVER YOUR HEAD AND DRAG YOU OFF --  THAT'S VIE WHRENT. I DON'T DO THAT. THAT'S EXCESSIVE. I DO IT ALL THE TIME TO MY KIDS. I READ CONSTANTLY TO THEM. I READ THEM "FROZEN."  Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOUR CHILDREN?  NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  Stephen: IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ON WHETHER THEY ARE OF TARGET AGE FOR FROZEN.  22 AND 25, STEPHEN.  Stephen: REALLY? YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.  58, BROTHER. 58.  Stephen: YOU HAVE TO SEND ME YOUR MOISTURIZER REGIMEN.  3 AND 6.  Stephen: BOYS, GIRLS? BOTH GIRLS.  Stephen: THEY ALL WANT TO BE --  ELSA, ANNA. NOBODY WANTS TO BE ME IN MY HOUSEHOLD. IT'S SAD. ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: YOU WERE THE REINDEER OR THE BIG FROST MONSTER. ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU READ EVERYTHING AS OLAF?  WELL, IT'S MY VOICE, SO I REALLY -- ( APPLAUSE )  Stephen: I KNOW THAT! I KNOW THAT!  SURPRISE!  Stephen: GO AHEAD. 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS -- ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT, WAIT, CLOSE YOUR EYES.

( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )  Stephen: I LOVE YOU. I KNOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS" OPENS FRIDAY! JOSH GAD, EVERYBODY!-From the first film, we know that you are sort of the cooler of the two dads. -Yeah. -You and Will -- I think it comes across in the clip, as well. What about -- You have children. You had a premiere for the film. Do they think it´s cool that their dad is Mark Wahlberg? Did they come to the premiere? -They did not come to the premiere. -Really? -They basically refused to come to the premiere. -Why -- Why did they refuse? -They were like, "Dad, we´ll see it whenever we see it." I´m like, "Come on, everybody is going to be there. Will´s going to be there. John Cena is going to be there." They had no interest. And, of course, Will shows up with his wife and the kids and they´re all in suits and dressed up and -- But, you know, they just didn´t want to go. The boys were watching football. My daughter is on the phone, doing her thing. -Do they just -- Do you think it´s that they aged out of their dad being cool? Do you think your heyday of being a cool dad is over? -It´s been over. -Okay. -You know, so now I´m like, I don´t make a point to embarrass them, but I´m not going to try to hide my affection for them either. So, they´re like, "Dad, drop us off in the alley at the school." And I´m like "No. I´m going to walk you in. I´m getting a kiss in front of all your friends. And that´s it." But, if they need something, if they want to meet Drake, or they want somebody that, you know, they know Dad knows or can hookup... -Yeah. -...then they´ll say, "Oh, yeah Dad, we think you´re cool for five minutes." -Gotcha. [ Laughter ] So they´re not smart enough, if they want to meet Drake, to, like, be nice for a week leading up to the ask? They just -- -For a week? No. They´ll be nice for five minutes. If they don´t get what they want, when they want, they´re just right back to not talking to me or just, you know, being, you know, kids. But, you know, they´re kids, so I understand. -I´m not that -- My son is a year and a half, and he´s just super. I think he thinks I´m the coolest dude he´s ever met ´cause he´s only met like six dudes. [ Laughter ] -Enjoy it while it lasts. -Yeah, I´m going to. -And more importantly, be grateful that it´s not a girl. And, now, mind you, the best relationship that I have with my daughter -- Daddy/daughter relationship is great, but when they become teenagers, something happens. You have no idea what to do about it, how to handle it. The hormones, the emotions. It´s absolute torture, so -- I mean, watch out. -That´s really sweet. [ Laughter ] -Yeah, it´s sweet until it happens to you. And like I said, we´re cool. But you know what? The whole thing with the boys and all of this stuff, I´m just not ready for it. -Yeah, I gotcha. So, I want to ask about this because Will was here yesterday and I didn´t have a chance to ask him about it. But your assistant -- Did your assistant get a part in the film in the end? -He got a part in the end, but he got cut. -Oh, he got cut. -Yeah, and he only auditioned for like one line. One word, really. -Okay. He´s yelling one word in the audience of the -- the improv club. But we made him audition to Tim Hutton´s most emotional scenes in "Ordinary People." -[ Laughs ] So wait -- -And he spent weeks and weeks and weeks studying these scenes, learning the lines. Like, he emoted in front of me and Will and Chris Henchy for like -- -So you made him audition in front -- He didn´t have to audition. He auditioned for you and Will and Chris Henchy. -We are the producers of the film. We basically said, "Yes. You have to do this." And you know what? He did a good job. But then they -- he didn´t -- he did a good job in the audition, but maybe didn´t do a good job in the actual scene. -Yeah, so you had to -- -So the scene got cut. What can I do? But I told Tim Hutton. Tim Hutton and I worked on a movie after that, and I told him, and Tim really wanted to see the footage. -Oh, really? Did you show -- -I didn´t get it in time. And I don´t think he would have -- I think at first he thought we were paying homage, but then I think I realized that he might not have liked it after he saw it. -Wasn´t quite up to Tim´s standards. -Right, exactly. -Won an Oscar for that part. -He did win an Oscar for that part. I forgot that. Now, I also heard that -- so Will -- John Lithgow plays Will´s father. -Uh-huh. -And they have a fight scene. And you encourage them not just to go for it when you were shooting it, but to like actually physically go for it in rehearsal. -John is a method guy. Will is -- You know how Will -- -Yeah. -He´s a such sweet guy, right? So he doesn´t want to say anything to John. So, like, you know, when they had to do the first big, long, awkward kiss, right, I´m like, "Oh, that was really good. You guys got to do that again." And then I keep telling John, "Do it more often." Then John is doing it at rehearsals, he´s doing it when they´re just blocking the scene. And Will would never say anything, but I could tell he was getting annoyed. So I would start, you know -- It was giving me great pleasure. [ Laughter ] And then when they started doing the fight scene, you know, John was just, like, putting him in a headlock. And you could tell Will -- ´cause, like, we did 15 takes of the first scene where I had to give him a heart pump and try to revive him. And he didn´t say anything until, like, I almost caved his chest in. He was like, "Maybe now that you got the hard one in, you do one of those soft ones. You probably have a soft one in you." So I´m like, "Okay." So, and then John was just torturing him. It was a lot of fun.-Thank you so much for being here! -Yeah, my pleasure! -And I want you -- I owe you extra thanks. -Okay. -We had you booked first, and then we actually had to ask you would you be willing to be a second guest to Hillary Rodham Clinton and you said, "Yeah." -I´m not the first guest? [ Laughter ] -No, Hillary Rodham Clinton was just out here, yeah. -Hillary? An impersonator? -No, no. We had the real -- The real Hillary, yeah. -Was on. -Yeah. -Just minutes ago? -Just right before you, yeah. -Why am I even out here? -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -Yeah. -I mean, I think it´s still, you know, we can get across -- -Oh,. Wow, Hillary? -Yeah. -Was sitting here? -What were you watching in your dressing room? -I was playing Sega Genesis. [ Laughter ] Yeah. -The very old. -The very old Sega. -We don´t have one. Did you bring -- -I have a pocket Sega Genesis I bring... -Oh, gotcha. Oh, gosh, yeah. -...with me. -Well, you missed Hillary Rodham Clinton. How´d you do? Were you doing well? -I was playing -- What was I -- I was playing "Centipede." Yeah, yeah. -Gotcha, wow! -On Sega Genesis. -Oh, wow. -Oh, so I´m the second guest? -Yeah. -That´s -- that´s still good. -Yeah! [ Cheers and applause ] -Because it´s -- It´s 1:18 in the morning. Yeah. -Yeah, it´s a little late now. -I couldn´t figure out why it was so late. -Yeah, it´s really late. -And I´m like, "They´ll knock on my door at some point." -Yeah. And that´s the thing -- Well, you say, like, time doesn´t move. -By the way, this is Sega Genesis, just so those at home, if you´re just tuning on right at this moment, people will know. [ Laughter ] You might want to do a lower third. -A very small one. Yeah, we´ll put Sega Genesis there. And then hopefully, they´ll send you some free stuff if we get a Sega. -Ooh! [ Laughter ] -So you shot "Daddy´s Home 2" in Boston. -I did. Yeah, we did. -And you were staying at the hotel when the Celtics were in the playoffs last year. -Right. -Every team that the Celtics played in the playoffs would come through. -Would stay at the Ritz-Carlton that I was staying at, and I would run into the players, occasionally. One time I ran into some of the Washington Wizards, who then said, "Wait, you got to come with me." Took me into a room which was two adjoining rooms and was their impromptu training area. -Oh, they were playing basketball inside? -No, no, no. They were giving people massages. Not the players, the training staff. -Okay. This is getting very shady. Are you sure it was the Wizards? [ Laughter ] Are you sure these people played for a basketball team? -Yeah, the wizards. They were six Asian guys. They call themselves the Wizards. [ Laughter ] -It was not -- I think you walked into a -- -I was in the South end of Boston. -Okay, so you walked out of the Ritz-Carlton. -Yeah, I was out of the -- -Okay, yeah, I don´t think that was a basketball team. -Okay. Well, I did, however -- okay, here´s the true part of this story. [ Laughter ] This is the best part right here. So, this -- the teams would stay at this hotel, ´cause they also had a -- it was connected to an Equinox gym. Hope I get an Equinox pass for that. Sega Genesis. Lifetime membership to Equinox. -Oh, a lifetime? Yeah. -So, they had a gym there, so the teams would stay in that hotel ´cause they could do their pregame workout. -Mm-hmm. -And the Cavaliers were there. And I´m, you know, lifting weights... -Yeah. -...using the Universal weight system. [ Laughter and applause ] Love to get some Universal weights. And I see Lebron James. -All right, that´s pretty good. -So, I´ve -- I don´t usually bother people. I kind of know Kevin Love a little bit. -Uh-huh. UCLA, right? -I said hi to Kevin. UCLA. I said hi him, and then I went over to Lebron. I´m like, "I just have to say hello. How are you?" And I just said, "I was just telling my wife the other night that you need to run for President. -Mm-hmm. -You´re from the Midwest. -Yep. -You´re very famous. You´re very popular. You´re very articulate. Please run for office." So, Lebron. [ Laughter ] -Doubled down. -I´m telling you now, we need you. [ Cheers and applause ] And I would love some of your shoes. -Oh, my God. Really? Can this be -- You just have one genuine thing without it being about getting free stuff. -I´ve got four things coming my way, so yeah. -I think, at best, you´re going to get one or two.-Welcome back! [ Cheers and applause ] -Good to be here, buddy. -Always great to see you. -Thank you. Thank you. -Got to see you with one of the sweetest women in the world, Kelly Clarkson, right there. She´s an adviser this year. You´re saying no. Maybe not. -She used to be a friend, but now she´s competition. -Oh, I see. -Yeah. -So once anybody joins the realm of "The Voice," a history of friendship goes out the window. -Yeah, because we had actually started filming the blind auditions for season 14. -Got it. -So we´re in competition mode right now. -Because she´ll be a judge in season 14. -That´s right. -That´s interesting. So no matter what your history is, they´re just dead to you immediately. -Enemy, yep. -Wow. Well, again, this is why you´re so successful. -That´s right! -Because other judges let things like a heart get in their way. -That´s -- Can´t do it. -You can´t do it. -Can´t do it, man. I didn´t sign on to lose. -That´s right. -That´s right. -You -- but... -They hired me to win the show. -You -- Just to speak to your history, You guys have done a duet together, you and Kelly. -We´ve done a duet together on a Christmas album, and then we´ve done another duet together live a bunch of times, which is actually a hit that she had with Jason Aldean. -Uh-huh. And do you enjoy -- So, you go out and you sing with Kelly? Is it very loose when you do something like that? Do you get nervous when you´re singing on somebody else´s show? -[ Sighs ] I get nervous when I sing with Kelly. I mean, look -- I can do -- I can sing a little bit. -Yeah. -But Kelly -- -That´s what everyone here says. -But -- [ Laughter ] -Exactly. So Kelly and I, we´ve have known each other for every bit of ten years, and we´ve been great friends it´s -- Oh, my God, the stories I could tell, but -- She used to come to my shows back in the day every now and then, and hang out and that´s actually -- That´s another story. Never mind. She used to come hang out at my shows and she had this hit song at the time with Jason Aldean called "Don´t You Want to Stay Here a Little While." And... at some point it was like, "Hey, you´re coming to my shows. You got this -- How about I work up that song with my band? You´re here anyway goofing off, getting drunk. [ Laughter ] You come out in the middle of my show and nobody knows you´re here, and it´ll be huge." And so we did that, and she came out. And I remember the first time she ever did it, she came out and the crowd -- It erupted. "It´s Kelly Clarkson. -Sure. -Oh, my God. We only paid to see Blake. -Yeah. [ Laughter ] -We got our money´s worth now," you know what I´m saying? So, anyway, it was incredible and then she came again. It happened, like, three times at my shows, and I remember every night after it was over I would go backstage and hanging out and we´re all partying and having fun and be like, you know, "What did you think? I mean, that was unbelievable." And every time she would be like, "Eh, that was pretty cool." And I´m, like, "What? There was -- All these people freaked out." And so then she had a show. This was a long -- this is way longer than you thought. -No, but this is nice payoff. I´m excited. -So then she had a show in L.A. and she called and said, "Hey, I want you to come do that song at my show this time." And I owed her one. -Sure. -So I went. -Technically you owed her three, I think. -No, that´s -- Please don´t hear that, Kelly. And so I went out and did the song with her that night and after the show I said, you know, "Oh, my God, that was so cool, man. What did you think?" And the same thing it´s, like, "Well, it was pretty good." [ Laughter ] And I remember, I go, "What -- What in the hell?" Like, what -- I thought -- I thought I was hitting the notes I was singing. -Yeah. -I know I was singing on pitch, damn it. [ Laughter ] And she looked at me, and I´ll have to clean this up, but she said, "How come you never sing the song like we´re screwing?" [ Laughter ] And I remember thinking, "What?" So -- And I rem-- And the reason that even came up is ´cause now she´s a coach on "The Voice" and I go, "Kelly, you can´t be saying stuff like that to these kids." -Yeah! Well, I´m glad. -So... -I´m glad you´re there to keep her on the straight and narrow. -Thanks for making me tell that story, too. -I like that story a lot. -I enjoyed it. This audience, they´re... -I would -- Now, hopefully, singing like that is easier now with Gwen stefani because now you do duets with her. You co-wrote a song. -It works better with Gwen. -Yeah. -Yeah. -You´re, like, already there. You don´t have to do any of the pretend part. -Well, I mean, you know.

I WAS IN THE MIDDLE--  I HATE THOSE EMBARRASSING --  Stephen: I WAS JUST TRYING TO REHEARSE SOME OF THE MATERIAL, AND AS I WAS TRYING TO REHEARSE IT, YOU WALKED OUT JUST TO SAY HI IN YOUR UNDERWEAR. AND-- HEY! I GOTTA TELL YOU-- I GOTTA TELL YOU, FOR ME, IT'S LIKE I'M THE CHEERLEADER MEETING THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM BECAUSE-- I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY TIRED OF THRG. BUT YOU WERE IN THIS MOVIE CALLED "LORD OF THE RINGS. OF.  I WAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).  Stephen: HAVE YOU HEARD ME TALK BUIN THAT? YOU ARE MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN MY FAVORITE MOVIE. I AM-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT-- HOW TO DESCRIBE HOW EXCITED I AM TO MEET YOU RIGHT NOW.  LET ME JUST SAY-- FIRST OF ALL, THE REASON I DID THAT, COME OUT TO SEE YOU LIKE, THAT MY 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ELIZABETH, BEGGED ME NOT TO DO ANYTHING TO EMBARRASS THE FAMILY. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD DAD.  ELIZABETH, I LOVE YOU. NOW WE'LL WEIL GET BACK TO THE NORMAL PART. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT "LORD OF THE RINGS" THAN ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE "LORD OF THE RINGS" COMBINED GLI FOUND OUT-- AND IT ONLY SLIGHTLY BROKE MY HEART, THAT YOU-- WHEN YOU GOT THE PART, YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT "LORD OF THE RINGS."  MY DEGREE FROM U.C.L.A., IS IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN HISTORY-- OR HISTORY IN AMERICAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE.  Stephen: OKAY.  IT'S A BRITISH-- IT'S AN ENGLISH STORY.  Stephen: YES, IT IS.  U.C.L.A., THEY'RE GOING TO BE MAD THEY KIND OF-- ACTUALLY, WHEN MY AGENT CALLED ME, SHE SAID, "HONEY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FLAWLESS BRITISH ACCENT BY TUESDAY." THIS IS EYE REAL CONVERSATION. AND I SAID OKAY. SHE SAID "PIERCE JACKSON IS DOING THE 'LORLD OF THE RINGS TRIOLOGY '" FOR NEW LINE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE "LORD OF THE RINGS" PART WAS. SHE SAID IT'S THE SEQUEL TO THE HOBBIT, THE HOBBIT. HONESTLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE "PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH. GLVMENT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.  TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

APPARENTLY, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME.  Stephen: EXACTLY. ARE YOU YOUR OWN FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM "LORD OF THE RINGS." SAM IS THE HERO, TOLKIEN HIMSELF SAID SAM IS THE HERO OF "LORD OF THE RINGS."  I THINK THAT SAM WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WANT TO BE CONSIDERED HERO OF THAT STORY SO MY OFFICIAL, ON-THE-RECORD ANSWER IS NO. I HAVE TWO FAVORITE CHARACTERS. GOLUM, THE STINKER, EVEN THOUGH HE KEEPS CALLING ME STUPID, FAT HOBBIT, IT'S ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING CHARACTERS. AND TREE BEARD.  Stephen: SURE, YEAH.  I LOVE TREE BEARD. AND SOOTS SO KIND OF-- I GUESS IT'S SORT OF TYPICAL AND POLITICAL WHATEVER.

Stephen: YES.  HE'S AN IMP. AND THAT'S IT, I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT, MY DAD IS TREE BEARD. AND THEY COME TO LIFE AND FIGHT TO DEFEND --  Stephen: THE FOREST.  THE FOREST AND, YEAH, AND ACCIDENT SCENEY AND STUFF. SO I JUST LOVE THE IDEA OF, LIKE, WHETHER OR NOT MAN WANTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PART IN WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT, THE ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T CARE. IT'S GOING TO COME-- IT'S GOING TO RISE UP AND PROTECT ITSELF.  Stephen: I HOPE SO. ( APPLAUSE ) I HOPE SO.  IT WILL.  Stephen: NOW, YOU'RE ON "STRANGER THINGS."  YEAH, "STRANGER THINGS."  Stephen: NOW YOU'RE ON "STRANGER THINGS," SECOND SEASON. IT'S SET IN THE 80s. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE ONE OF THE STARS OF THE GOONIES, AND OTHER THINGS LIKE ""E" "T"" ARE BIG INFLUENCES ON THIS SHOW.

THIS GREAT DISCOVERY. THEY HAVE, LIKE, HISTORICAL ADVISERS ON THE SET TO TALK ABOUT WHAT POSTERS WOULD BE RIGHT TO GO ON THE SET.

THIS IS AS LOW AS THE TAN EVER GOES. ( LAUGHTER ).  YOU SEE, THERE'S --  IS IT?  THERE'S A RACE BETWEEN HIS SKIN AND HIS LUNGS TO SEE WHO WILL GET CANCER FIRST. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: IT'S LIKE-- IT IS LIKE-- IT'S LIKE WHEN HE SHOWS UP IT'S LIKE WHO PUT A FAMILY BIBLE IN A SHIRT?  WELL, HE-- I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM, BECAUSE HE STAYS AT MY HOUSE-- DOES HE EVER STAY AT YOUR HOUSE?  Stephen: I HAVE NEVER TOLD HIM WHERE I LIVE.  I FEEL LIKE HE BEHAVES DIFFERENTLY-- HE LIVES IN NEW YORK-- WHEN HE COMES TO VISIT IN L.A.  Stephen: THERE'S DEFINITELY EAST COAST BABY DOLL, WEST COAST BABY DOLL.  LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS. EAST COAST BABY DOLL, DOES HE WEAR A LOT OF COLOGNE.  Stephen: I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WITH HIM SOMEPLACE, AND HE HAS SAID, BUT WE HAVE TO STOP. I NEED TO GET SOME COLOGNE."

HE WEARS ONE KIND OF COLOGNE, VERSACE, IT'S EXPENSIVE AND HE GOES THROUGH-- MY HAND TO STEPHEN UP THERE-- ONE BOTTLE OF COLOGNE A WEEK.  Stephen: HE SMELLS FANTASTIC THOUGH.  HE, DOES, HE SMELLS GREAT. SO DOES MY WHOLE HOUSE NOW THANKS TO HIM. DOES HE CALL YOUR ASSISTANT AND ASK FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S SHOW SOTHAT HE CAN THEN CALL YOU AND TELL YOU HOW GREAT IT WAS THE NEXT DAY?  Stephen: WELL, GOD, GOD, I HOPE NOT! BECAUSE IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU HAVE JUST BLOWN AN ILLUSION THAT I I THOUGHT HE ACTUALLY WATCHES WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.  MAYBE OCCASIONALLY, BUT RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT EVEN WATCHING THIS. HE'S GOT TWO CLIENTS ON AT ONCE AND HE'S OUTSIDE SMOKING. DOES HE BRAG ABOUT HOW MANY HOUSES HIGH OWNS AND COUNTRY CLUBS HE BELONGS TO IN YOUR PRESENCE?  Stephen: HE'S VERY PROUD OF THAT.  HAS HE EVER USED THE SENTENCE, "I'VE GOT TOO MANY CARS," WHEN IT SNOWS IN FRONT OF YOU.  Stephen: THE THING IS, HE'S-- IT'S YOU, ME, JON STEWART. WHO ELSE HAS HE GOT.  JON STEWART, CARSON DALY, ADAMICA ROLLA.  Stephen: HE'S THE REAL KING OF LATE NIGHT. IT'S BABY DOLL DIXON. IT'S THAT GUY RIGHT THERE.  THE LITTLE KING.

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Stephen: HOW COULD THAT GET CANCELED?  I KNOW. THAT'S ROBERT SMIGEL'S VOICE. I REMEMBER THE DAY WE SHOT YOU WITH THE FISH.  Stephen: YEAH.  WE HAD-- IT WAS A LIVE CARP, AND WE KEPT IT IN A BIGINARLE, AND IT WAS ALIVE IN THERE, BECAUSE WE WANTED IT TO FLOP AROUND.  Stephen: YEAH.  I MEAN, I'M ASHAMED NOW. BUT-- ( LAUGHTER ) AT THE TIME, NOBODY KNEW THAT FISH ARE, YOU KNOW, VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOW WE KNOW. BUT --  Stephen: WHAT IS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CRUELTY TO TROUT?  YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, LOOK, IF I DID SOMETHING WRONG, I'M READY. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: REAL QUICK, THOUGH, I DO WANT TO TELL THIS ONE STORY. IT WAS A REALLY STRESSFUL SHOW. WE WERE CANCELED. LET'S PUT THAT--  THAT'S RIGHT.  Stephen: WE WERE CANCELED AT SEVEN SHOWS. AIFT THEM WERE MADE, SEVEN OF THEM WERE BROADCAST.  RIGHT.  Stephen: I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY?  IT WAS A FUNNY SHOW.  Stephen: YOU WERE A HEAD WRITER. IT WAS A STRESSFUL SITUATION TO BE IN.  I WAS 26 YEARS OLD SO I WAS A LITTLE OVER MY HEAD.  Stephen: WOW, ROCKIN' THAT LEMON YELLOW SWEATER. I THINK IT WAS AFTER THE VERY FIRST SHOW WE WHERE DANA WAS BREAST FEEDING PUPPIES AND KITTENS DRESSED AS BILL CLINTON.  WITH MILK SPURTING OUT OF IT.  Stephen: AND PEOPLE OPERATING BULBS WITH MILK--  AND REAL LIVE PUPPIES AND KITTEN S.  Stephen: IT DIDN'T GO WELL. I COME AROUND A CORNER AND WE HAD ALL THESE LITTLE OFFICES AND I COME AROUND THE CORNER, AND YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY OPENLY WEEPING.  EVIDENCE CRYING, RIGHT.  Stephen: DO YOU REMEMBER WHY?  I WENT INTO YOUR-- THEY HAD THESE LITTLE STALLS FOR QUICK CHANGING. I WAS IN YOUR STALL --  Stephen: I DRAGGED YOU INTO THE STALL BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR THE HEAD WRITER TO BE OPENLY WEEPING.  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY.  Stephen: BETWEEN TWO SHOWS SO I DRAGGED YOU IN AND DID PRATFALLS FOR YOU TO MAKE YOU LAUGH.  YOU MADE ME LAUGH. THAT'S WHEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH STEPHEN UNTIL THAT MOMENT I THOUGHT HE WAS AN ALIEN WHO HAD COME-- LAUGH AND THEN THAT DAY-- IT WAS A TERRIBLE DAY. SKETCH COMEDY IS STRESSFUL. IT'S WEIRD THAT IT IS, BUT SKETCH COMEDY IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO.  Stephen: IT'S HARDER THAN ANYTHING. IT'S LIKE WRITING SONNETS. EVERY SINGLE ONE HAS A BEGINNING, MIDEXPEL END.  THAT'S RIGHT.  Stephen: AND IT'S OVER IN THREE TO EIGHT MINUTES AND YOU TO GO ANOTHER.  IT WAS VERY STRESSFUL AND I WAS SHAKING AND CRYING AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW YOU VERY WELL. AND YOU SAID, "COME ON." AND YOU TOOK ME INTO YOUR LITTLE ROOM.  Stephen: YEAH.  AND YOU OPENED YOUR PANTS EYE DON'T KNOW WHY. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: GOT A LAUGH, THOUGH. THAT'S WHY. GOT A LAUGH. EXACTLY.  NO, YOU WERE JUST VERY KIND TO ME. YOU WERE VERY KIND TO ME. STEVE SEN VERY KIND-- YOU CAN TELL BY LISTENING TO HIM TALK.  Stephen: YOU'RE A VERY KIND PERSON, TOO. YOU'RE VERY SWEET.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I AM BESIDE MYSELF WITH EXCITEMENT BECAUSE MY NEXT GUEST HAS PLAYED SO MANY ICONIC CHARACTERS, FROM RUDY TO SAMWISE GAMGEE AND MOST RECENTLY PAUL MANAFORT. HE NOW STARS IN "STRANGER THINGS."  I WAS A LITTLE YOUNGER WITH YOU STANDING IN LINE FOR THE FERRIS WHEEL AT THE COUNTY FAIR. I FEEL A WHITE GLOVE TAP ME ON THE SHOULDER. I SPIN AROUND AND THERE HE IS, "HEY, KIDDO. WOULD YOU LIKE A BALLOON." GO AHEAD, LAUGH. IT WAS FUNNY. IT WASN'T FUNNY BACK THEN, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. I COULDN'T GET HIM OUT OF MY HEAD. EVERY NIGHT, HE WOULD COME TO ME IN MY DREAMS. EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE CAME TO ME, I RAN.  Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME SEAN ASTIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS )  THAT'S AWESOME.  Stephen: HI!  HI.  Stephen: IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.  FINALLY!  Stephen: YEAH, WE MET BRIEFLY DURING REHEARSAL.  YEAH.  Stephen: BECAUSE YOU WALKED OUT ON STAGE-- DO WE HAVE THIS? I WAS IN THE MIDDLE--  I HATE THOSE EMBARRASSING --  Stephen: I WAS JUST TRYING TO REHEARSE SOME OF THE MATERIAL, AND AS I WAS TRYING TO REHEARSE IT, YOU WALKED OUT JUST TO SAY HI IN YOUR UNDERWEAR. AND-- HEY! I GOTTA TELL YOU-- I GOTTA TELL YOU, FOR ME, IT'S LIKE I'M THE CHEERLEADER MEETING THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM BECAUSE-- I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY TIRED OF THRG. BUT YOU WERE IN THIS MOVIE CALLED "LORD OF THE RINGS. OF.  I WAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).  Stephen: HAVE YOU HEARD ME TALK BUIN THAT? YOU ARE MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN MY FAVORITE MOVIE. I AM-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT-- HOW TO DESCRIBE HOW EXCITED I AM TO MEET YOU RIGHT NOW.  LET ME JUST SAY-- FIRST OF ALL, THE REASON I DID THAT, COME OUT TO SEE YOU LIKE, THAT MY 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ELIZABETH, BEGGED ME NOT TO DO ANYTHING TO EMBARRASS THE FAMILY. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD DAD.  ELIZABETH, I LOVE YOU. NOW WE'LL WEIL GET BACK TO THE NORMAL PART. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT "LORD OF THE RINGS" THAN ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE "LORD OF THE RINGS" COMBINED GLI FOUND OUT-- AND IT ONLY SLIGHTLY BROKE MY HEART, THAT YOU-- WHEN YOU GOT THE PART, YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT "LORD OF THE RINGS."  MY DEGREE FROM U.C.L.A., IS IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN HISTORY-- OR HISTORY IN AMERICAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE.  Stephen: OKAY.  IT'S A BRITISH-- IT'S AN ENGLISH STORY.  Stephen: YES, IT IS.  U.C.L.A., THEY'RE GOING TO BE MAD THEY KIND OF-- ACTUALLY, WHEN MY AGENT CALLED ME, SHE SAID, "HONEY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FLAWLESS BRITISH ACCENT BY TUESDAY." THIS IS EYE REAL CONVERSATION. AND I SAID OKAY. SHE SAID "PIERCE JACKSON IS DOING THE 'LORLD OF THE RINGS TRIOLOGY '" FOR NEW LINE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE "LORD OF THE RINGS" PART WAS. SHE SAID IT'S THE SEQUEL TO THE HOBBIT, THE HOBBIT. HONESTLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE "PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH. GLVMENT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.  TOTALLY DIFFERENT.  Stephen: AT ANY POINT DID YOU READ THE BOOKS?  YES.  Stephen: BECAUSE THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD.  I-- I-- THERE WERE SOME THAT DIDN'T.  Stephen: SOME ON THE-- IN THE CAST?  I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.  Stephen: WHO DIDN'T READ THEM.  I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.  BUT I READ THEM COVER TO COVER THREE TIMES, AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM. TO ME, IT WASN'T LIKE BEING TRANSPORTED INTO ANOTHER WORLD. IT WAS LIKE WORK, YOU KNOW. IT WAS LIKE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW WOULD HE HOLD THE PIPE? YOU KNOW, HOW WOULD --  Stephen: RIGHT.  HOW WOULD-- ALL THE LITTLE-- THE LITTLE YOU IN GLANSZ THEY CHANGED A FEW THINGS ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER.  OKAY, GO ON. AND I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU BY THE WAY.  Stephen: I'D LOVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS, BE A GUEST ON MY OWN SHOW.  SORRY. ( LAUGHTER ).  Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER, YOUR VERSION OF SAM, YOU CALL HIM MISTER FROADO, IN THE SCRIPT HE WAS MASTER.  I THINK I SAY MASTER SOMETIMES. THEY'RE LONG, YOU CAN'T WATCH ALL THE THEM AT ONCE --  Stephen: YES, YOU CAN. YOU CAN WATCH ALL OF THEM AT ONCE. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE PANTS ON. ( LAUGHTER ).  APPARENTLY, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME.  Stephen: EXACTLY. ARE YOU YOUR OWN FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM "LORD OF THE RINGS." SAM IS THE HERO, TOLKIEN HIMSELF SAID SAM IS THE HERO OF "LORD OF THE RINGS."  I THINK THAT SAM WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WANT TO BE CONSIDERED HERO OF THAT STORY SO MY OFFICIAL, ON-THE-RECORD ANSWER IS NO. I HAVE TWO FAVORITE CHARACTERS. GOLUM, THE STINKER, EVEN THOUGH HE KEEPS CALLING ME STUPID, FAT HOBBIT, IT'S ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING CHARACTERS. AND TREE BEARD.  Stephen: SURE, YEAH.  I LOVE TREE BEARD. AND SOOTS SO KIND OF-- I GUESS IT'S SORT OF TYPICAL AND POLITICAL WHATEVER. DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, WHEN YOU GO ACROSS ENGLAND, THE SMOKESTACKS BELCHING, AND PEOPLE WERE HAVING LUNG PROBLEMS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, AND TOLKIEN WROTE THIS STORY, AND IN THE STORY HE CREATES THESE TREES, THESE SLOW, LUMBERING, THINKING, TALKING TREES THAT WERE JUST LIKE MY DAD-- REMEMBER JOHN AFTIN, GOMEZ.  Stephen: YES.  HE'S AN IMP. AND THAT'S IT, I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT, MY DAD IS TREE BEARD. AND THEY COME TO LIFE AND FIGHT TO DEFEND --  Stephen: THE FOREST.  THE FOREST AND, YEAH, AND ACCIDENT SCENEY AND STUFF. SO I JUST LOVE THE IDEA OF, LIKE, WHETHER OR NOT MAN WANTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PART IN WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT, THE ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T CARE. IT'S GOING TO COME-- IT'S GOING TO RISE UP AND PROTECT ITSELF.  Stephen: I HOPE SO. ( APPLAUSE ) I HOPE SO.  IT WILL.  Stephen: NOW, YOU'RE ON "STRANGER THINGS."  YEAH, "STRANGER THINGS."  Stephen: NOW YOU'RE ON "STRANGER THINGS," SECOND SEASON. IT'S SET IN THE 80s. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE ONE OF THE STARS OF THE GOONIES, AND OTHER THINGS LIKE ""E" "T"" ARE BIG INFLUENCES ON THIS SHOW. WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS REALLY FAMILIAR TO ME?  YES, IT'S A LITTLE BIT-- WHAT'S SO COOL IS THE DUFFER BROTHERS WHO CREATED IT, THEY'RE SO SWEET AND SUCH BEAUTIFUL GUYS. AND YOU'RE STANDING THERE AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT, LIKE, A RADIO SHACK OR, YOU KNOW, A GREMLIN CAR OR ALL THESE KIND OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE-- AND THEIR IDEA, IT'S LIKE THEY'RE UNPACKING ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND OR SOMETHING. THIS GREAT DISCOVERY. THEY HAVE, LIKE, HISTORICAL ADVISERS ON THE SET TO TALK ABOUT WHAT POSTERS WOULD BE RIGHT TO GO ON THE SET. SO TO ME, LIKE, THE 80s IS-- WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD YOU ARE, BUT TO ME THE 80s IS-- HE'S KIND OF TIMEs, RIGHT? LIKE, YOU CAN'T EVEN-- ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS ) YOU ARE. YOU ARE. ANYHOW, IT IS-- YES, IT IS A WONDERFUL THING TO WORK WITH THESE YOUNG PERFORMERS, AND WYNONNA RIDER AND THE FANS LOVE IT TO DEATH, AND I'M JUST BLESSED AGAIN TO BE INVITED TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SPECIAL.  Stephen: WELL, WE'RE BLESSED THAT YOU ARE. LOVELY TO SEE YOU, SEAN.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  Stephen: "STRANGER THINGS" IS ON NETFLIX NOW. SEAN ASTIN, EVERYBODY.
